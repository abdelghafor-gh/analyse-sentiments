"We had such a lovely time at this Riad. My sister and I moved here after seeing it written about in Lonely Planet. We booked it last minute because we decided to move from a place we had booked ahead of time, and Sammy and Myriam were super accommodating and helpful with this. The Riad is simply beautiful and impeccably clean. I was working on some essays for school and I spent some lovely mornings on the terrace writing. The breakfast was pretty small, so if you are super hungry in the morning you might need to supplement, however, it is included in the price and is delicious. The coffee is wonderful and freshly made, which when I am traveling I always notice! Would love to go back again next time I am in Essaouira."
"Stayed for 2 nights, found staff where very helpful, gave me a demonstration of how to make mint tea. Lovely Riad and room, comfortable bed. Relaxed on the terrace on a few occasions. Found the Riad with the help of Google maps and the signs pointing to it. Breakfast was good, and they looked after my bag on the morning of leaving while I had another walk round."
"We loved our 5 days in Essaouira, Les Matins Bleus is a gorgeous Riad in a very convenient location in the medina but only a short 5 minute walk from the port car park     And a few minutes more from the beach. The staff were friendly and welcoming, the place and rooms were kept clean and tidy and we enjoyed a good breakfast each morning. "
"Perfect perfect perfect, definitely this riad couldn't be better! The most beautiful and pleasant stay we had in Morocco. Excellent breakfast, beautiful and huge terrace, super comfortable rooms and the most helpful and welcoming staff ! I wish to come back soon"
"Delightful hotel in the Medina - reasonable prices, lovely rooms, traditional and beautiful Moroccan style. Terrace is small but lovely to sit on and watch roof tops at sunset.  Nice breakfasts.  Best thing is the staff- everyone who works there is lovely, helpful, friendly."
"The staff was very helpful and friendly and went out of their way to help us solve problems...like a lost phone.  The rooms are small but adequate, breakfast is provided and served quickly.  No complaints at all.."
"We ended up extending our stay in Essaouira, having a good time knowing well have a good sleep at this tidy and colorful place. Also enjoyed the sunny mornings on the terrace.
The owners and staff both make you feel welcome and try to assure you have a great time.  
There's really nothing I can decry.."
"Wonderful hotel. The pictures actually look exactly like the hotel, which is very rare. The beds are rock hard, but that is standard in the country. Breakfast was great, warm chocolate bread, a crepe, and other breads and jams. Everyone was friendly and we had a great night. Their is a very off-putting smell in the alleyway, but not a big deal."
"I think I fell for the picture of green plants and blue paint. It is ever so nice, small and cozy hotel in the middle of the medina in Essaouira.  9 rooms, we had one on top of the roof with terrace and potted plants.  The staff is wonderful, smiles early and late.  "
"We recently spent five nights in this spectacular riad and couldn't have been more content with our choice.   Absolutely perfect.   Samir and his wife were hospitality personified, looking out for our welfare and providing excellent restaurant recommendations.  They also booked our taxi to the airport.  Our top-floor rooms were comfortable and beautifully painted, with views of the terrace.   Both the hotel and the neighborhood adjacent were very quiet.  Breakfasts were delicious.   We highly recommend this riad to the economy traveller.   Indeed, we plan to book our room there next time we return to beautiful Essaouira."
"We really enjoyed our stay a this Riad - a great central location but peaceful inside. The colour and decor makes the place lovely to spend time in, as do the family who run it. Breakfast was great too. We stayed in one of the smaller double rooms but there was good space and more in the communal areas downstairs and on the roof which we used to read books. Definitely recommend! The owners were also really helpful organising us an early taxi back to the airport which was really appreciated."
"I stayed at Le Matins Bleu for 3 nights and was so glad to have found this great riad. The staff, Samir, Youssef and Miriam were very friendly and helpful. The riad is beautiful and the attention to detail with plants, rugs and ornaments creates a wonderful oasis in the middle of Essaouira's vibrant streets. It is very clean and the breakfast is great. My room was on the terrace, perfect to enjoy the October sun but can also be quite hot.
The riad is highly recommended - I was travelling solo and felt at home immediately. I aim to be back :)"
"We had a very pleasant stay in Les Matins Bleus!
I was travelling with my family and we had the greatest expirence.
They had this lovely patio on the ground floor and the terrace on the rooftop was just the best. The breakfast was amazing and the dinner that we had was one of the best morrocan foods that we ate during all our stay.

The hotel made us feel very welcome, they were all very friendly and helpful."
"Staff are extremely friendly and helpful.Breakfast with fresh juice was amazing! I stored some beers in the fridge, no problem. They all really make you feel a part of the family. The riad is beautifully kept and the location is amazing."
"We decided to visit Essaouira for 3 days, during a 10 days stay in Marrakech. We decided to book this place thanks to reviews found on TripAdvisor. It is well located, charming and clean, the staff is very friendly. You can have dinner as long as you order it before 4pm. The food is delicious, fresh and homemade. There are different sizes rooms with different prices. As there were 4 of us, we had a large double room with a sitting room. We paid 860 DH a night (79€), breakfast included. There is no air conditioning but it was not needed when we stayed in July. There is a heater in the room. The bathroom is quite small and the shower is tiny. The rooms on our level had no window on the street but only windows on the indoor courtyard. Breakfast is huge and delicious. We would definitely recommend this place. "
"A lovely riad in the old centre of Essaouira. 
Very clean and comfortable with simple but attractive airy rooms. Quiet at night. Lots of plants and a nice roof terrace - amazing spot for yoga in the mornings! 
Incredibly kind and friendly staff. Felt very safe. 
And at the end of the alley, there’s a French lady who sells incredible tiny pizzas and other goodies! 
Definitely would stay here again if I come back to essaouira."
"This riad, teeming with cascading greens, was a great choice. The room was clean and cozy, the breakfast delicious, and staff friendly. The town is rather flat but there are stairs in the riad. Breakfast was served on the roof and there are two lounges on the first. The riad is within walking distance to everything."
"I booked this Riad after reading reviews and was delighted I did. Really enjoyed 6 nights here. We had a really lovely twin room on the rooftop and could sit across the way for breakfast - pictured. Which was delicious. Pancakes, freshly squeezed orange juice, bread etc.
Staff were excellent, helpful and nothing was a problem. Like more coffee, towels etc. Rooms spotless and cleaned really well.
It’s very well positioned in the Médina and once you get your bearings it’s no problem to get anywhere and close to fab restaurants and the beach etc. Really happy to have stayed here."
"We enjoyed our 3 day stay at Les Matins Bleus. The hotel was clean and nicely decorated. We had a second floor room which opened onto the courtyard. The shutters on the door and window added an extra level of quiet and provided privacy. We especially appreciated the heater in the room which kept us toasty and warm. It was conveniently located inside the Medina and a short walk to everything. The hosts are super friendly. The breakfast was good and we loved having breakfast on the sunny roof top terrace! We especially appreciated the owners serving us breakfast on our last day 1/2 hour earlier than their normal breakfast hours so that we could eat and still catch our bus. We would highly recommend staying here on a trip to see Essaouria."
"Very charming hotel neatly tucked away at the end of a cul-de-sac. The interior is very cool - colourful with a lot of hanging plants.

The rooms are simple but very clean and comfortable and had a welcome heater to offset the New Year chill at night. 

Breakfast was again simple but very filling - freshly squeezed orange juice, cafe, bread, fruit, crepe and jams. Delicious in a very communal setting. 

Or hosts were incredibly kind and helpful and recommended lots of good restaurants and places to visit.

We have no problem in recommending Hotel Les Matins Bleu to anyone and hope to return again as soon as we can."
"I've stayed at Les Matins Bleus a few times over the years and it never disappoints. It's always quaint, beautiful and feels like home. Everyone is very friendly, helpful and accommodating. If you're looking for an affordable stay at a sweet cozy place, Les Matins Bleus is perfect!"
"Lovely little riad close to all the main attractions. Very clean and comfortable, nicely decorated rooms with local textiles and pottery, comfy beds with good quality linen. Friendly and super helpful owners and staff.  We had a suite, which was great, with a double bedroom and a cozy sitting area, and a mezzanine with an extra double bed.  Breakfast was plentiful, nice coffee, pastries and fresh juice, and they will happily ferry it all up onto the roof terrace for you too!  Would definitely stay here again, highly recommended."
"Nothing fancy, but overall a nice riad on a great location. They had an extra heater in the room, which was great in these cold winter nights. The breakfast was included and it was maroccon style, so plenty of sweets."
"As a travel journalist I am used to stay in good hotels but Les Matins Blue is one of the special accommodations. The Riad is perfectly located in the city center of the romantic city Essaouira. The house is in the hands of a very friendly family, which is affectionately keeping care of their heritage. The rooms are small but clean and equipped with everything necessary. A very authentic experience. 

One personal tip if you stay there: TASTE THE DINNER IN THE EVENING! 
Fatimah is a great cook and her three-course menu was one of the best meals we had on our Morocco tour."
"I stayed here for the third time last month.. It's so pretty and cosy and all of the staff make you feel like a friend and family member..They are so helpful and kind.. The ambience is great as is the breakfast.. If I could rate this riad as ten star I would. Go visit this place and you will fall in love with it. "
"Charming hotel with very friendly staff which runs on friendly prices. They are just in perfect place not too far from the Medina but not so close so the hotel is really chilly. Their breakfast is ok, the orange juice is just superb and fresh."
"Nice room small and cozy. Liked breakfast and the coffee. Big Nice rooftop, great service. Helped us With our questions and friendly People. Blue hotell Nice and quiet. Hopefull we will Come back somtime.  
"
"We stayed here one night during our stay in Essaouira. The hotel grounds were very clean though were a little warn. We stayed in one of the rooms on the terrace which was lovely and cool. Everyone in the staff was very helpful and always available. We enjoyed out breakfast on the terrace which was very generous portions for the two of us. The hotel is very central in the medina so was easy to walk everywhere (including the bus station) though was very quiet once you enter the walls. We would stay here again if we were in Essaouira."
"I've been for 3 nights in this beautiful place last week with a friend of mine , we had a great time here the best thing about it is it's in the old medina & only 5 min Walking to the beach plus it is so calm & quiet away from all the noise from the streets of old medina, the staff are always there for any requests , the  entire riad is clean  besides our room always cleaned up after the delicious breakfast at the terrace , thanks to all the girls and to Samir , Youssef and the other Youssef , thanks for making our stay great , for sure we will be back once again.

I RECOMMEND THIS RIAD TO ANYONE WANT CALMNESS IN MOGADOR .
"
"We booked this Riad after a TERRIBLE experience at another one and leaving early. Les Matins Bleus was MUCH better! It is beautiful and owned by a family. We were greeted with tea and a map of the city when we arrived. 

Our room was on the terrace and had a comfortable bed and a great shower :) At night we went up the stairs to the top part of the terrace and watched the stars for a while (beautiful!). Breakfast is yummy and they will bring it to the terrace if you wish to eat there, or you can eat downstairs also.

We were originally going to stay one night, but loved it so much we ended up booking for another. The wifi was out for half our stay, but apparently it was a company issue. I didn't mind too much as we were out most of the time anyway. Otherwise it worked perfectly. It is located in the old Medina. and if we are to return to Essaouira in the future (likely) I would definitely book here again. Thank you for an amazing stay :D"
"The staff at les matins bleus went above and beyond our expectations to make us feel comfortable, and always with a wide grin on their faces, even during the challenge of ramadan fasting! They were always happy to shed some local insight on essaouria and on the final evening cooked us a huge delicious homemade meal. The riad is stylish in an understated way with leafy vines hanging down and a rooftop terrace that is perfect both for lounging in the sun and sheltering from the wind. The big breakfast always set us up for the day with fresh fruit and juice. Its so comfy and mellow here you won't believe the mad alleys of the medina lie outside of the door. Highly recommend for a romantic experience of essaouria.
Jack and Anna"
"This is a perfect location for a brief stay in the heart of Essaouira's medina. Within easy walking distance of all the town's sights. Converted and run by several friends, the riad is welcoming and nicely presented in all it's traditional furnishings. Don't be put off by the little alley that leads the last few metres to the riad, it is freshly washed at least twice a day.

We stayed in room 6 on the 2nd floor, up in the fresh air on the terrace. The room was simply furnished but comfortable and clean. The double bed was surprisingly comfortable and the en-suite bathroom had plentiful hot water and good towels.

The included breakfast was very tasty, fresh orange juice, pain au chocolat (or a croissant), bread and tasty coffee. We had a small number of honey bees who visited us at breakfast to sample the home made jams (they were never any problem other than having to fish them out of the jam when they fell in!!).

Youssef (x2) and Siad, who we often found on duty at reception, were all charming and endlessly helped with ideas, tips and advice. Thanks!!"
"Everything was perfect.

The cute and beautiful little hotel is located in the center of the Medina and still very quiet and cozy.

The owner was incredibly helpful and he speaks four languages fluently (German English French Arabic) so he can help you out in whatever language you need.

The staff is super friendly and the breakfast on the sunny rooftop was fantastic.

The rooms were very comfortable and super clean.

We felt very welcome and at home and would recommend the hotel for everyone!

Cheers!"
"This is a lovely hotel located right in the heart of Essaouira: very clean, quiet at night, very good breakfast (including pain au chocolat and fresh orange juice), and the friendliest hosts (Samir and Youssef were so welcoming and had great recommendations for dinner). A really genuine place run by locals!"
"Wonderful, unusual decor, fabulous staff and sumptuous  high thread bedsheets. The breakfast was the best we had in Morocco. A great place to escape the bustle and recharge our batteries before returning to Marrakech. Highly recommended!
"
"I'll make this short and to the point. Stay here. The price is right, breakfast is very good, location is perfect and you are in sweet Essaouira. This place is colorful and funky in a very good way. One last thing... Stay here! "
"It's a really nice and cosy building 50 meters to the principal street in Essaouria, so it's really well located into the Medina. Also, there's a dazzling and gorgeous rooftop with some rooms there and where you can have a typical moroccan breakfast, and specially that one, is one of the best breakfast I ever had.
All the staff working there is really nice, always trying to help us in everything, and making our stay so much pleasant.
You'll feel as at home!"
"I came to Essaouira for a little adventure before starting a new job. Was looking for complete escapism and sun, peace, and exploring opportunities. Essaouira did not disappoint, and Le Hotel Matins Bleus was the perfect base from which to set out each day. Tucked away down a little back street it was useful to be shown the way the first time, but it is perfectly located in the medina close to great places to eat and stalls packed with colourful wares. The staff were incredibly friendly and went above an beyond to help with any questions or arrangements that needed to be made. 

The rooms are ranged around a really pretty central courtyard and there are places to sit and relax in the evening, and a sunny terrace for breakfasts. The rooms are comfortable, and cheerfully colourful. I chose once of the smaller cheaper rooms (advertised as single although actually a small double) with a separate bathroom. It was really good value for money and all I needed so I was happy - but if i came with my partner there is a great choice of double rooms with ensuite bathrooms. Would recommended this place to everyone."
"The best place in Essaouira to lay your head. A family run riad with owners who just want you to enjoy your stay. Nice breakfast with evening meal if requested. We had an en-suite room on the top floor, next to the terrace where you can have breakfast and easy access (up a few steps) to the roof sun bathing/lounge bed area. The riad is showing time lapse wear and tear which gives it character and history. Being inside the Medina adds to its charm. Essaouira is undergoing massive refurbishment to the promenade, port and the Medina walls, but access to the 3km plus beach and all places of interest is not restrictive.  Would I return, Yes, and stay at the Les Matins Bleus.         Go to Morocco it is an experience.... you will regret it.... if you don't....."
"We really enjoyed our stay at Les Matins Bleus. The hotel is very clean and comfortable and the staff are very helpful and kind. I loved their mint tea and breakfast was delicious. They have a lovely sitting area to relax and read and also a great rooftop area which is nice for lounging in the sun! 

Les Matins Bleus is in the perfect location right in the centre of the medina and is nice and quiet. I would definitely recommend this hotel if you are thinking of staying in Essaouria, it is very good value. 
"
"Great place. Excellent value for money. Comfortable. Convenient. Family run and a very friendly welcome. Good breakfast. Clean room and good bed - the shower was ok, but could have been better, so only a minor gripe! Sunny terrace. Very happy to have stayed here. Thank you."
"This was our 4th time at Les Matins Blues, and as expected we had a pleasant stay.
Samir and all the staff are really friendly and helpful, offering if there is anything you may need. A taxi for our transfers was arranged to and from the airport, and spices bought for us at a ""good price""
Great location, in the heart of the medina, but suprisingly quiet.
We love it here, and will defiantly return as it is exceptional value "
"Location was fabulous. I especially liked the sitting room - pretty space with comfy furniture. Unfortunately one of the owners was hanging out in the sitting room watching videos on his ipad without headphones, so it spoiled the peace for me. They take credit cards, but none of my three credit cards worked with their system, so maybe have cash as back up. I really liked breakfast - especially the moroccan pancake. As seems to be usual in Morocco though, coffee was pretty weak. I would definately stay here again, it was charming!"
"Staff was friendly and helpful. Very accommodating to our requests for a wake up call and early breakfast before leaving to Marrakesh. The breakfast was delicious and filling. Offers mint tea/coffee when I was in the lounge area. However, had to sit outside our room (terrace) for wifi, no wifi in room. Otherwise perfect riad! Will come back again. "
"The riad is amazing and the staff was extremely kind. They fulfilled every need and request. breakfast was very good: mint tea, bread, orange juice, fruit, bread, pan au chocolate and confitures. Highly recommended!"
"Good riad hotel in essaouira. Tiny street leads to an oasis of peace in the cozy medina of essaouira. Samir, yousef and the other personel are really helpful and do their best to accommodate all your wishes. The rooms are clean and well kept every day, beds are good. Bathroom is also neat and tidy but shower can be a bit cold if you visit out of season because of the solar powered heating. Breakfast is simple but good, fresh orange juice included. I can definitely recommend this place!"
"This small hotel is family run and nothing is too much trouble for them. Tucked away in a quiet corner of the old city the upper rooms where we stayed have a good view over the roofs of the city and an excellent view of the night sky/  Quiet and peaceful at all times, it is a traditional Riad and all staff I met speak English and French as well as Ararbic.
Local Wifi is a bit flaky but that is Morocco rather than Les Matins Bleus, many other places we visited during the week couldn't connect at all."
"Me and my girlfriend had an absolutely fantastic few days in this little piece of paradise!  I have nothing but praise for all of the staff there, they were excellent throughout!  From the very first welcome, to the fantastic breakfast service to the genuine concern when my girlfriend was ill. The rooftop was quiet and chilled, and it is right in the centre of the impressive old town which was great for exploring.  Everything is close by foot.  When we visit Morocco again we will be sure to stop by... Thank you and Vielen Dank!  5*"
"this hotel is wonderful. The breakfast was typical moroccan and served on the rooftop terrace. Very delicious bread and fresh orange juice as well as fruit salad and a variation of jam and butter.
The owners, Samir and Yousef are very nice and friendly.
The rooms are very simple and clean.
All in all, we could not have been happier with our choice staying in the Hotel ""Les Matins Bleus"""
"Nice, simple clean rooms. Staff are very friendly and it has a nice relaxed atmosphere. 
Excellent location, close to the port and all the best restaurants in the medina. 
Would recomend to friends and stay again if we return to essaouria. "
"A last minute decision to visit Essaouira again before Ramadan brought us back to Les Matins Bleus, but this time with two friends ... Of course, we knew what to expect from Samir and his staff, having visited before – but our friends were completely bowled over by the hotel, its location, its charm, and peaceful vibe. Not to mention the simple yet delicious breakfasts, and the deep and restful sleep enjoyed after days in and around Essaouira.

As an old general once said: ""I shall return."""
"We stayed at this wonderful Moroccan gem for 3 nights in June and could not have been happier with our choice.
From start to finish our hosts could not have been more welcoming, helpful or friendly.  The rooms were clean and cozy and the facilities were everything you need. 
We had breakfast each morning on the terrace which was beautiful. They even made us tea and coffee when we asked for it which we enjoyed on their sunny terrace.
Our hosts helped us by providing their usual fabulous breakfast for us earlier than usual on our last day as we had to be at the airport for our flight home quite early, they did this for us without question or any trouble at all. 
We stayed during Ramadan and on returning from dinner one evening Youssef even offered us a try of his delicious Ramadan sweets made by his sister-we thought this was super kind and generous. 
We would definitely return! Thanks to everyone at Les Matins Bleus! 
"
"Great place to stay right in the centre of the Medina. The hosts were so friendly and helpful, easy to navigate your way around the Medina from this base. A really nice breakfast, the rooms and hotel are kept spotless and the Internet was good throughout. A delightful stay."
"“Its a lovely Riyad ....Good place to stay”
We were there for just 3 days.The Hotel Staff is very helpfull and nice...especially Samir and Khaled 
5 minutes to walk to the old town..In the centre were lots of great shops& places to eat...
we wish to return ..."
"Clean room, nice service. 
Riad is difficult to find because last 50 metres you walk by small sideroad but location is good; in the medina center, 5-10 minutes to the beach. 
Breakfests small and simple, but based on our experiance it's typical for hotels' breakfests in Marocco.
Stairs steep, if it's a problem choose rooms on the first floor.
We stayed in double room, but there are available bigger appartments with the attic.
Staff speak French and English.
Ratio price/ quality very high."
"We stumbled across this riad on trip adviser as a friend and I wanted to take a break from Marrakech and visit Essaouira. We only stayed for a night but the room was great! Facilities including the bathroom and wifi worked fine, the room was very clean and they do free breakfast! i would 100% recommend this to anyone visiting Essaouira."
"This little hotel is quite cheap and is a very nice little riad the staff were very friendly and the breakfast was great. There is a terrace on the roof and the location is perfect right in the middle of the medina. Would definitely recommend it."
"My friend and I stayed here for 3 nights at the beginning of March after reading a lot of positive reviews on Tripadvisor. The location is great and the rooms are comfortable if a little basic. The staff were really helpful, giving us some great restaurant recommendations - the Caravan Cafe was a particular highlight - and the breakfast was consistently good. The only issue we had was with the Wifi connection, as it is only available in communal areas. Other than that, we really enjoyed our stay and the Riad is definitely great value for the money."
"... is often the best way to find the best places. And it was word-of-mouth from a Kenyan in London, that led us to Essaouira's Les Matins Bleus – run by Samir and his impeccably discreet staff. Les Matins Bleus is, basically, one of those hotels that you don't believe exist anymore in this age of homogeneity, multiple chains, and branded (so-called) luxury. Instead it is an incredibly chic, and laid-back Riad; simply and tastefully decorated; with one of the most comfortable hotel beds we have slept in (and we have first-hand experience of the beds in Paris's Hotel Crillon, Venice's Danieli, and Mexico City's Habita).
Apart from the fact that Essaouira is the most chilled, and laid-back destination in Morocco; Les Matins Bleus is an absolute oasis in the heart of the Medina ... there is no noise from the surrounding bustle – absolutely none!
This is the first (and probably last) TripAdvisor review I have submitted. And the reason is that you can trust my word-of-mouth ..."
"We enjoyed staying at Les Matins Bleus because of the beautiful room with a nice old wooden ceiling and floor and there were a lot of plants, a nice roof terrace and a tasty breakfast. Everyone working there seems to do so with joy and with a lot of attention towards the guests. It was clean and felt very safe."
"This Riad is one of the best in Essaouira. Nice and calm with a great staff. The service offered is worthy of a Four Stars Hotel. Room are made up daily with fresh linen and towels and are very well decorated. Breakfast includes freshly orange juice, omelette, jam and honey.Very highly recommended"
"stayed for 3 days just before christmas.When i walked in to register Mr young was on cd had to be a good omen and it was.Nice people nice room up on the top central location,would not hesitate to go again(even take my lovely wife).Would reccomend this nice well priced riad wish i could have stayed longer.Thank you,Stewart"
"We loved staying at Les Matins Bleus. Comfortable beds, beautiful interior, art, books and music in the communal area downstairs, delicious breakfast, friendly staff, relaxed vibe and right in the middle of everything. We will be back!"
"Les Matins Bleus is great value for money. A convenient location just moments walk away from the town walls, harbor, beach and the rest of the medina. It's tucked away down an alley, as are most of the medina riads and hotels. There is a sign sticking out on the more main thoroughfare nearby, so it's easy enough to find.

Decor is lovely, traditional tilework and intricate painted details. Even the wooden bed frame was painted in traditional style. There are a couple cozy lounges, with books a plenty, card and board games, a TV and even a computer you can jump on if you want.

The filtered daylight in the internal courtyard where we ate breakfast is cool and relaxing all through the day. Breakfast all three days was very good included warm, fresh pain au chocolate - the last morning we ate early, and they were delivered directly to our table from the delivery.

The roof top terraces are a lovely place to while away some of your day. There are tables and chairs if you want to play cards or write, or there are lounging couches on the upper level. There are also drying racks for swim suits or laundry.

I thought this was part of the charm, but I mention it in case you wouldn't like it: Just down the alleyway, a mere 2 buildings away was a mosque. You can see the loudspeaker pointing right at our roof top.
Elsewhere on our trip the adhan (call to prayer) was fairly brief. The muezzin at Les Bleu Matins neighborhood was, let's call it, very enthusiastic.
My spouse was most affected by the early morning adhan, at around 6am. On the third morning he timed it, our muezzin sang for 10 minutes and then did the adhan for a further 5 minutes. Very loudly."
"This is without a doubt the best riad we stayed in the whole Morocco! We arrived in Eussaoria 4 days ago and just walked around and explored different accommodation options until we found Les Matins Bleus. I cannot say a bad thing about our stay- everything was perfect! The breakfast was delicious, the rooms cleaned daily, the staff very polite and helpful. We missed our flight and had to buy a new one and the owners gave us a discounted rate for the last night. Lovely generous and kind people. Thank you for everything! Eussaoria is magical and so are its people. Will be back for sure! Daniella & Ewelina. "
"I travelled to Essaouira on 28th August alone. This hotel is amazing. The ambience is great. So cosy and beautifully decorated, blue and white with amazing mosaic walls and lanterns all over. Relaxing music was always played. It felt very romantic and authentic. The owners two Yeuseffs and Samir and the cook Meryam treated me like a friend and by the time I left I felt like I was part of the family. They were kind and helpful and so humourous. We had many talks about Morocco and life in general. I had only just landed home when they messaged to see how I was and if I arrived home safely. I miss the place already and will be going back as soon as I can. I have been to many big 5 star hotels but can honestly say this was 8 star!! I have never felt so relaxed and happy and I miss you all terribly. See you all very sson my friends. x"
"We stayed for one night as we were staying most of the time in Marrakech. We wished we booked for more days! The hotel is in a small side street and took a few minutes to find (had to ask some locals). We immediately loved it's quite and cozy atmosphere, our room was on the first floor and was  a split level room, pretty comfortable and well presented. The bathroom was a bit small but clean and ok for us. 
Breakfast was good and can be served in the sunny terrace. Most of all, we found the staff most helpful and friendly, they made us feel very welcomed even after we checked out and had to leave our stuff for a few ours before catching our bus back to Marrakech. Highly recommended! "
"Good location, nice and helpful staff with a pleasant vibe in the hostel. Had a comfy room with the best shower we had in Morocco, also the room was cleaned everyday. No air con or fan however we never felt too hot opening the windows was fine during the day and at night essaouira's temperature was much lower than elsewhere in the Morocco."
"We are so pleased to have found this hotel after a long day of traveling. It is a little difficult to find the first time as it is on an alley off of the main strip, but was well worth it! The staff was very hospitable, rooms were cute and clean, and the price was great. Breakfast was really nice as well, overall it was a great place. I would certainly visit again!"
"I stayed at LMB for the second time in July with a friend. We were warmly welcomed with tea and pastries as returning customers which was a lovely start to our stay.
Everything was perfect - service, cleanliness, attitude/helpfulness of staff... we were made to feel really welcome and nothing was too much trouble. We could use the computer or TV when we liked which was very kind. The riad is very beautiful and the sun terrace is a great place to spend a couple of hours in the afternoon. We had a lovely stay and hope to go back soon."
"It was my second stay at Les Matins Blues, and it was even better :-) The hosts are very friendly and easy-going and good advisors, the cook (Mheryam) is a STAR, the cleaning ladies gentle and wise, and the riad itself is very authentic. Breakfast is simple, enough and fresh, the rooms clean and the roof terrase great for yoga in the morning and naps in the afternoon. I loved it, thank you everybody there for a great time:-)"
"Spent 4 nights here with a friend and we really enjoyed it. The common room had plenty of sofas, making it and excellent place to relax after a long days surf. The roof terrace again was a great place to relax away from the wind. The rooms were well appointed and the food at breakfast was good. The dinner we had there was excellent. The staff were relaxed, extremely friendly and readily helpful. Would stay there agin"
"My girlfriend and I spent three nights at Les Matins Bleus during our recent trip to Morocco. The hotel is in the middle of the Medina at the end of a quiet little alley. Rooms are nice (particularly on the roof terrace) and very clean. The hotel is usually quiet, as we were there during off-season, we were practically the only guests. For those who enjoy seafood dinners, a lot of good restaurants are very close by, in particular the Elizir is a less than one minute walk from the hotel. Shopping (quality may vary) can be easily done in the adjacent streets. Samir, the owner, is a great person, very friendly and always there to help. From restaurant recommendations to leisure activities, there is little he doesn't know about Essaouira and its surroundings. He even came with us to help us buy a traditional Moroccan plate and made sure we paid a fair price. In the evenings, we shared our food, listened to music and had good and very interesting talks on Morocco and other travel destinations. Should we return to Essaouira, we would definitely return to Samir's place (and recommend others to do the same)... :)

"Nice little riad in heart of mediana   Smallish rooms but very clean and cheerful. Nice communal area on ground floor and lovely roof terrace. Staff are very friendly and helpful. Basic breakfast. Good value for money overall. No air conditioning but do not be put off by this as there really is no need for it given the breezy conditions and central courtyard which creates natural air conditioning."
"Comfortable stay here at a reasonable price. Good shower. The room was a bit small but breakfast was OK. Staff were friendly and helpful with spa and restaurant recommendations. Good central location in the medina. Easy to walk everywhere."
"Stayed here for four nights a few weeks ago. The hotel is very well located - down a quiet alley, but with plenty cafés and restaurants within easy walking distance. The staff were helpful, the wifi worked well (we had been warned it was sporadic in the rooms) and breakfast was plentiful. We were tired after three days trekking in the high atlas and Les Matins Bleus provided the perfect recipe for relaxing at a very reasonable price. I would definitely stay there again. And maybe even consider 'upgrading' - we had a terrace room but the suites on the first floor looked fantastic! "
"Perfect location, friendly and helpful staff, comfortable and good place to stay. My friend and I stayed at Le Matin Bleu for 4 nights.  Everything about it was good - I cannot think of a negative thing! The family running the riad were very pleasant and helpful."
"My husband, 11 year old son, and I spent one month in Morocco in December 2014. Les Matins Bleus and Essaouira with its protected harbour and nice long beach were highlights of our trip. 
Our hosts Youssef and his cousin were nice and helpful.
The room we stayed in was very nice. It's big, beautiful, clean, and comfortable. Good size for the three of us.
Breakfast was good and the service was great.
Good location.
We highly recommend this riad."
"Set at the end of a quiet alley, that is well positioned between the port/ramparts and main medina, Les Matins Bleus exudes charm. It has a delightful, worn simplicity that says relax.  There is plenty of common space to accomplish this, with an atmospheric salon divided into several sitting areas. Pillowed couches surround low tables with candles, their warm light reflecting off the walls covered with Moroccan tiles.  The rooftop terrace refreshingly catches the breeze, breakfast and tea is served there during good weather.  The main dining area is in an intimate courtyard that is filled with Moroccan paintings and weavings, and plant vines tangle down from the balconies above, enhancing its quaintness. 

The bedrooms are decorated simply, some much larger than others.  During our stay (the second week of January - 70F) we had the hotel pretty much to ourselves, so you can switch rooms easily in the off season.  We chose a room off the rooftop terrace which we were quite happy with and the bathroom did have hot water.

The hotel also arranged a taxi transfer from Marrakech Airport to Essaouira which worked out quite well. Taking slightly longer than two hours with stops for an ATM, water and at an Argon oil cooperative.  Don't be dismayed by the ancient Mercedes Benzes (20-30 years old) that are standard inter-city transport, they are everywhere.

We thought the hotel was a very good bargain and wish we had spent more there."
"At Les Matins Bleus for four nights in January 2915. I could not have picked a better place. It drips charm and reminded me of hotels in southern Spain and Argentina, with a great indoor patio type area. All the guys on reception were incredibly helpful. My room was completely charming and enhanced my Moroccan experiences without a doubt. A lovely environment to have breakfast. Fair prices. My recommendation for a stay in the lovely Essaouira"
"We went to Essaouira with nowhere to stay, and had been recommended Les Matins Bleus from some fellow travellers. We checked it out on here, and it seemed to be fully booked the night we arrived so we stayed somewhere else. That night, we actually headed to Les Matins Bleus to see if we may be able to stay the following days. They were according to tripadvisor fully booked still, but they actually have a few different varieties of rooms which they can switch around and things. We quirkily stayed in half a family suite where we had to climb through a window to get into the room, no big deal, and the room and bathroom were both lovely. There's also a nice terrace, perfect for relaxing away from the hustle and bustle. I'd really recommend this place, but don't trust the booking system on here, call/email them to check if they have space, they probably will, and it'll be the best choice you make this holiday."
"I'm only sorry we stayed here one night.  I was enchanted with the place the moment we stepped in the door, with its friendly welcome, beautiful decor and peaceful atmosphere, despite being right in the centre of town.  Our room was simply and stylishly decorated, very bright and very comfortable.  After exploring the town in the daytime, I took advantage of one of the multiple sitting rooms in order to read, listen to some Moroccan music and drink the last delicious mint tea of my trip.  I was so comfortable I am amazed I had the will to move from it so that I could go and get dinner.

P.S. The breakfast was easily the best we had in Morocco (beautiful fresh French-style pastries and bread -- definitely a cut above most Moroccan hotels!).  Also the staff were so helpful and laidback about leaving our bags in our room until our bus back to Marrakech -- this was much appreciated!"
"I've stayed at Les Matin Bleus three times now, so thought I should post about it. 

Essaouira is already a beautiful spot to visit, and this riad is the perfect place to stay. It's traditional and beautiful inside, with a fantastic sunny roof terrace, plants and birds chirping in the inner courtyard and a lovely cosy lounge area to play games, chill-out or just listen to music with a glass of mint tea.  The owners are lovely and friendly and I always feel really at home here. Samir, his brother and cousins are great hosts, the wifi is free and the coffee strong! If you are looking for a welcoming, traditional riad in the heart of the medina - this is the place to come. "
"When we first saw this riad from the outside, we were apprehensive, but as is often the case in Morocco, the unpromising exterior hid a perfectly adequate interior. The room and public areas were spotlessly clean and the bed was extremely comfortable. All of the staff were friendly and helpful and quite prepared to take care of our luggage until late in the afternoon on the day we checked out. The breakfast was as copious as it was delicious. At the equivalent of 30€ per night, the place is excellent value! Highly recommended!"
"My husband and I stay here for a week in October, we loved the hotel. Very traditional which was perfect, we felt very comfortable here. The staff were all so friendly and very helpful, and a perfect location for shops, restaurants and the beach. Even tho it was in the town centre was so peaceful. We would defiantly stay here again if we ever returned Essouria. "
"Stayed in this Riad for one night. We were a group of three and were accommodated in a suite. There was one double bedroom ensuite and one double bed in an adjoining room on a mezzanine level with a bathroom and seating area underneath. The suite was beautifully furnished, and the beds were comfortable with crisp cotton sheets. Although this Riad is in the centre of the old bustling city, it is very quiet and tranquil. There was no noise at night. Breakfast was served on the terrace. It was adequate, but not outstanding. All the staff were friendly and engaging. Our luggage was stored until the evening and we were able to use their toilet facilities before we left for our onward journey. I would recommend this beautiful place without hesitation and look forward to returning."
"Les Matins Bleus is a real oasis - relaxed and peaceful. The hosts, particularly Youssef and Samir are so helpful and will become good friends by the end of your stay. Nice rooms and good value for money are a just an extra bonus!"
"This is our 5th year visiting this little 12 room old riad hotel. It is definitely not for those that want pools, flat-screen TVs and minibars - because there aren't any. 
But if you want a warm welcome, comfy beds, solar showers, and a home-made breakfast served on the sun terrace every morning with a smile - then its your kind of place. Always helpful with anything you might need, this family-run place in the old town of Essaouira is really relaxing place to stay - and its cheap."
"This is a lovely riad in the middle of the bustling Medina of Essaouira. Very friendly and helpful staff, clean and authentic looking rooms... It has a poetic artsy feel to it. And they serve good food: a good size breakfast, and the possibility to eat (authentic and good, again) in the riad, with free cooking-lesson by chef cook Meryem if you like :-)
I'd love to go every year!"
"We ended our group tour to Morocco in Marrakech, then headed to Essaouria to spend five days on our own.  We had four nights at the Hotel Les Maisons, found easily with the help of the men who carted our luggage there from the Suprabus Station.  Once there, we did not have trouble navigating.  The rooms were clean and basic, with free wifi and breakfast.  There was a nice rooftop patio for relaxing.  Staff were great - we had dinner in the hotel one night, prepared by the terrific Miriam, who also did a free cooking demonstration and tasting for us the next night. The hotel is really a riad, formerly the home to the extended family of the proprietors."
"Given the cost of this hotel it is fantastic. Clean, nice decor, charming character, lovely breakfast and the staff are lovely. I wouldn't normally budget on accommodation but staying here has made me reconsider. Wouldn't think twice about going back. "
"For budget accommodation this was really good quality and value. Friendly staff, clean rooms, windy roof terrace, tasty breakfast and in a great location. We really enjoyed our stay here. I Would highly recommend.  "
"We booked a suite and had plenty of space. You can also choose one of the rooms on the terrace and have direct access to the morning sun over your breakfast. Staff is perfect, very attetnionate but not pushy at all. You ay have a typical dinner there if you choose.
You step out directly into the historical médina/ lots of shopping!
A 5 minutes walk and you reach a very long sandy beach.
The perfect place to have a quiet, relaxing stay."
"This was my second stay at Les Matins Bleus and it was as lovely as before.  Although it is set in the heart of the medina it is totally peaceful and relaxing.  The staff couldn't be more helpful and really make you feel at home.  We stayed in the rooms on the terrace and loved it.  The place is also spotlessly clean."
"We booked one of the suites for 4 nights with our two little kids and we couldn´t have imagined a better start into our trip through Morocco. Located in the very center of the medina however a very tranquil place. Stepping out of the hotel there are all the typical shopping facilities and restaurants. It´s just a few minutes walk to the beautiful beach, the harbour with it´s nice blue painted fishing-boats and the city wall. We had dinner in this hotel and it was definitely the best moroccan food on our 3-week vacation! Meryam the cook is outstandig and the food was excellent! Our suite was spacious and clean. The owners were very nice and always helpful. They arranged airport transfer for us and even supplied a baby-seat.
Absolutely child-friendly. Baby Crib available.
Best value for money."
"We wished we had more time in Essaouira!  A lovely coastal town with a relaxing vibe.  We enjoyed our stay at the Hotel Les Matins Bleus- the staff was helpful, rooms clean, breakfast was delicious, and the location was good.  Nice accomodations that won't break your wallet."
"We extended our stay here and ended up being here for 4 nights. We have been travelling a long time, experienced all sorts of accom from cheap hostels to 5 star hotels and found this to be the best value for money so far. Samir, Yousef and the rest of the staff were extremely friendly, helpful and professional. The location is hands down the best, right in the middle of the medina, with nothing more than a 5 min walk away and ensures you receive the true Essaouira experience. Wifi is very good and breakfast on the terrace is a must!"
"This place is perfect for people who are traveling to see Essaouira, not to stay in a 5-star luxurious hotel (good luck finding one). It's got basic but nice rooms, good coffee and bread/jam breakfast, and really great employees. I stayed with two friends while visiting from london, where we were on study abroad, in february of 2008.  I think it's worth saying that we felt safe here (being 3 young women), as harassment of Western women is pretty common (a ten year old boy ran up and lifted up my skirt when we were walking by the beach!). The guys who work at this lil bed and breakfast are also plenty willing to escort you to a more well-lit/busier area at night. If you want a real Moroccan experience while feeling comfortable and safe and well cared for, I highly recommend this place. Watch out for the feral cats wrestling in the alley right before"
"An excellent hotel which I doubt could be beaten for value, friendliness, location or service. We were given a surprise upgrade from the €39 double room to the larger, very attractive, first floor ""suite"" which usually costs €79 (a bargain even at that price) consisting of a bedroom, salon, bathroom, extra sleeping space on a mezzanine + free breakfast. The upgrade may have been due to us being in Essaouira ""out of season"" (a perfectly sunny Winter!) but there seemed to be a constant stream of guests so popular is this hotel - I guess we were lucky. My wife and I were very impressed by the young staff members who were extremely polite and genuinely kind. The rooms are spotless, heating was provided and the Riad is beautifully kept. The management of this hotel seems to be very serious about maintaining its well deserved reputation. The hotel is located in the medina in a quiet lane way - could be hard to find on your own. We were met at the Bab Shabab gate and guided to the hotel upon our arrival. Les Matins Bleus is up there with some of the best small, economical hotels we have stayed at anywhere in the world. Congratulations - near perfect for the price. Totally delightful."
"We stayed at Les Matins Bleus for 2 weeks and had  a wonderful relaxing stay. The Raid is perfectly located in the Medina.
The hosts genuinely want to please and help you have a nice stay, and are so respectful and pleasant it is very heartwarming.
Everything is very clean and the decor beautiful.
Breakfast served daily on the patio or dining room, all at your convenience. We had dinner 3 evenings, 3 course meal for 90 dirhams and any special meals would be cooked, what ever you fancy!!
I would recommend this hotel , and will defiantly return."
"nice/good:
nice suite for 4 inc. 2 bathrooms
simple and cosy small riad, nice ambient music
silence, good to rest
nice ""continental"" breakfast served 

to improve:
access through a not obvious dead-end street (hard to find)"
"Very charming hotel right in the middle of the medina. I stayed in the single room and I loved it. The decor was so cute. Staff was very nice and friendly, breakfast was simple but good. I would definately recommand this place for single travelers and families."
"First the residence of a caïd , then a primary school and now a family run Riad. It became our home port and first stop  always when visiting Morocco. Fresh orange juice, Moroccan pancakes with honey on the terrace in the morning sun. We love it."
"Best location and quiet area, beautiful family house, typical. A little noisy if you want to rest... The hosts are very nice (a whole family) and have the house for generations... An artist house ! The deco is great and so typical."
"Our fourth visit to this little riad hotel was just as enjoyable as the rest. The staff do their utmost to make your stay comfortable and relaxing, and the hotel is kept spotlessly clean every day. It is super-convenient for all the sights of the town and the staff can give you helpful advice and info on anything you want to see or do. Excellent value for money and a relaxing, intimate holiday break."
"We loved hanging out both on the terrace during the day and in the well-decorated inside area on the main floor (complete with music of your choice at night).  Most importantly, the staff was incredibly friendly and genuinely nice.  Apparently we're not the first to notice. We ran into a couple who had been coming here for years."
"The place was in a great location in the Medina.  Staff was Super friendly. And every day the room was cleaned & straightened up.  We had a great stay, so much my father inlaw is moving to this hotel for the next 2 weeks from his previous riad."
"A good place to stay for the price.  Rooms and amenities are basic, but clean.  Location is central in Essaouira's medina and very easy to find based on the map on their website.  Best part of this place is the staff.  It's run by the young family members who are personable and ready to help you out with any questions.  Breakfast is served on the terrace and is lovely."
"I loved Les Matins Bleus! The atmosphere is incredible. Its more than charming. Its like a hidden treasure. The first floor has an open dining area, but then several smaller lounge-like rooms that are very cozy at night. I enjoyed time at night just drawing and drinking mint tea (delivered by a friendly and extremely helpful staff). I had the smallest room, which had a bathroom outside the door, but it was perfect. The room was very comfortable, and even though it was warm, they offered an extra heater just in case. Breakfast staff was attentive, offering me more coffee as needed. Desk staff was also very helpful.  The decor was beautiful--every detail considered. I wish I lived there! Also, it was an incredible value. Highly, highly, recommended!"
"My girlfriend and I stayed there for 2 nights in March 2013, and it was lovely. It was well located and not too hard to find with a map. The staff were very friendly and gave us recommendations for places to eat. The included breakfast was good. It’s worth asking for a room on the top floor as you’ll have a very nice sight when you wake and these will have natural daylight. The website pictures definitely don't do it justice...!"
"My girlfriend and I staid for 1 week in feb 2013 in this lovely little old family house. We understood from the young familymembers who run the place that it used to be a primaryschool and that they lived for several generations in it. It is situated in the heart of the old Medina: so an excellent location to discover the beautiful city. And surprisingly tranquil. The personel is unbeleavably friendly, modern / liberal (they say themselves: 'Muslim light') and speak many languages excellent! They make time for you, every contactmoment they have a friendly word and make a short chat. They serve a lovely breakfast, fresh orangejuice every morning and fresh bread! The rooms are just perfect, not very spacious but clean and charming, with a hot shower! They managed a taxy from the airport for us and one of the brothers even accompanied us to the house of a painter and negotiated for us. Essaouira is a pearl to discover and my girlfriend and I are very happy that we picked this place to stay. So highly recommended!"
"Such a lovely peaceful atmosphere in contrast to the busy town outside, run by genuinely caring and friendly staff. The rooms are fairly basic, but clean and will meet all of your needs. The home cooked food is fantastic and very reasonably priced. I really couldn't fault this place at all."
"I stayed here for two nights. Because of the layout you do hear people coming up and down the steps (from my room anyway) but guests were not very noisy.  The price was reasonable and the lobby is very cozy.  Staff are extremely friendly and helpful (they called the hotel in my next destination to arrange my booking).  Breakfast, which was included, was pretty basic but they do have a very nice rooftop where you can eat. I would stay here again. It is also a very short walk to the water."
"The Riad is a calm get away with great music playing up to the terrace. The People are warm and friendly and always ready to make suggestions for what to see. The location is perfect; easy to find and near everything you could want. It is close to the supra tours bus station, near one of the big gates to the medina and plenty of food around the corner. I loved it so much that I have already returned with my family."
"Received a warm welcome at this very well managed hotel. In the center of Medina but calm environment, friendly staff  and a good breakfast in such a wonderful town makes for a very great stay. We will never forget.  Definitely come back one day and recommended.
Figen & Yves"
"We stayed here for only one night during a quick getaway from Marrakech. We chose it because it was a very good value, and looked to be in the Medina area. We easily walked from the Supra Bus Station in about 15 minutes or so. Everyone we met here were very friendly. The hotel was very pretty inside, and had a great ambiance. Our room was on the top floor. It was small, with two beds, and a private bathroom. This was the only place during our stay in Morocco that had a shower curtain! We were on the terrace level, and it was nice to sit there with a glass of wine and use the wi-fi. There are no views from the terrace, so I left my tired traveling buddy on the terrace while I ran out once again to go to the ramparts in time to see the sun set. I would be happy to stay here again."
"Received a warm welcome at this very well managed hotel. Central location, friendly staff who helped organize some tours and a solid breakfast in such a wonderful town makes for a great stay. Definitely recommended."
"We really enjoyed our stay at Les Matins Bleus.  The staff are friendly and helpful.  The house is beautiful, comfortable and quiet.  Breakfast was delicious.  Great location in the medina.  Good value for the money."
"Hotel Les Matins Bleus was a great option for Essaouira.  The hotel itself has a very relaxed vibe.  The staff were friendly, knowledgeable, and informed.

We departed the hotel before breakfast service, but they were kind enough to provide us with pastries and orange juice before we departed."
"We had a great time in this hotel, very clean & quiet and helpful reception gave us the same , best rate for the unbooked night we stayed, got a really good rate online booking which they matched. We had breakfast first morning was very god..."
"After three years we stayed for the second time for three nights in this lovely family run hotel hidden in the medina. This time also we were very pleased with our stay and it will be our starting point by our next tour through the South of Morocco."
"We stayed one night in Les Matins Bleus and the hospitality was excellent. The guys recommended a restaurant, looked after our bags for us despite us having checked out (our bus wasn't until the afternoon) and let us treat the riad as our home.
The booking process was easy and we received email confirmations and directions very promptly and even an email to say they hoped the onward journey had been good.
The room we had was upstairs on the terrace and was clean and comfortable. The breakfast was pastries, bread and jams, fresh juice and coffee. We had ours on the terrace but you could also eat downstairs if you preferred. 
The location in the medina is great as you are in the heart of everything but there is no sound pollution and we slept really well.
Would definitely return and have no hesitation in recommending Les Matins Bleus to other travellers."
"I love this place, initially booked in for two nights - received an email almost as soon as I'd sent my enquiry - very helpful instructions on how to find it from the bus station.. I booked in for another two nights - no problem, but I has to change rooms as mine had already been booked... New bedroom has to be entered into via a window from the patio (very quaint)  breakfast on The terrace is just lovely and their cooking always smells really nice - although I tend to go out to eat as there are just loads and loads of good restaurants around...  the staff are all really friendly, furnishings very tasteful and simple - they play good music and there is an all round lovely ambience..."
"I went to Les Matins Bleus with a friend with the intention of staying two nights. We were warmly greeted, despite being nearly two hours early, and shown to a lovely little room on the terrace. The room was furnished with very good taste - lovely painted beds and table and pretty Moroccan lamps. We could have breakfast on the terrace or downstairs in a room off the courtyard. We immediately booked an extra night as we were so taken with the hotel.
Breakfast was very good - a pancake and selection of bread and pastries with fresh orange juice and tea or coffee. There was also an optional evening meal which we had every night as we were so impressed - the tagines became more spectacular each evening!
I cannot recommend Les Matins Bleus highly enough and will go back next year."
"We stayed at les Matins Bleus with a couple of friends over the Gnaoua music festival. The manager of the place welcomed us with warmth and told us about Essaouira and how to get where. The hotel is right in the medina, which is a beautiful site. 
The rooms are comfortable and clean, breakfast is traditional and continental, and the wifi works fabulously everywhere in the riad. The plus: the manager loves ""old"" bands such as Pearl Jam, if you feel nostalgic of your teen years, just go there!"
"Beautiful authenic decor.  The staff did everything they could to make our stay as pleasant as possible.  Recomend eating an optional evening meal at the at the ryiad."
"We were a group of 6. We reserved a suite w/ 2 BR/2 baths and a sitting area as well as a separate room. The staff was super friendly. The breakfast was excellent. We were sorry to only stay one night."
"Everything about Les Matins Bleus is just so wonderful. The staff are incredibly welcoming and treat you as a part of their family during your stay while still maintaining the upmost level of professionalism. I stayed three nights and had an afternoon departure on my last day. Checkout of the room was before 11:00 but I was able to store my luggage and relax in the common area of the riad as I pleased. 

The rooms were very clean and comfortable and breakfast in the morning was great. I stayed in the riad’s one single room for two nights which had a sink in room and private shower and toilet just outside of the door.  My third night I switched to a double room on the second floor as the single room had been previously booked. The staff was so accommodating and even moved my luggage for me while I was out for the day so to cause me as little inconvenience as possible.
 
I can’t say enough good things about my experience and wish I had stayed in Essaouira longer! Great place to relax and get away from the hustle and bustle of some of the larger cities in Morocco."
"This place was easy to find in the laid back beach town of Essaouira. It's got clean, bright rooms on the terrace level, and a nice breakfast. This was a good base for exploring town and for taking some time to relax or nap in the afternoons. The managers and staff were so welcoming and friendly to us.  Great place!!"
"The owners of the hotel are friendly and very helpful!  Our rooms were clean and inviting and breakfast on the terrace is wonderful. They helped to make our stay Essaouira a great experience.  I would definitely stay here again."
"We ended up staying an extra night. The staff is so so helpful...Breaksfast upstairs on terrace is a wonderful way to start the day. Everything is very clean and comfortable. They made our expericenc in Essaouira very special...Would go back. Nancy  San Francisco"
"We spent our first night in Morocco in Les Matins Bleus and were delighted by the calm oasis after a hectic arrival. The room was very comfortable and clean. The staff is very friendly, helping out where needed and giving a warm welcome. We left Essaouira after a good night sleep and a nice breakfast with new energy and a good feeling. We would book Les Matins Bleus definitely again."
"We stayed here for four nights and thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  The riad was very friendly, giving a personal touch and I particularly liked finding out how the evening meal was prepared when I spent some time in the kitchen.  Our room was at the top on the terrace which was great - very close for breakfast!  The breakfasts were lovely - a little more variation would be appreciated as it was the same every day and was getting a bit 'samey' by the fourth morning - different pastries would be lovely.
Our room was quite small but clean and perfectly adequate - excellent value for money.

On the cook's day off we asked for ideas of places to eat and one recommended provided a delicious meal.
We loved the location of the riad - up an alleyway so quiet but in the medina so very close to everything - great!
A pleasant touch, when we returned home was a courtesy email from the owners - a lovely touch.
We'd definatelystay in Les Matins Blue again - hope we can!"
"Me and my sister stayed here for a night in April and had a wonderful time. The staff were so friendly and accommodating, the room was clean and tidy and the rooftop was stunning and perfect for lazying around and also for the yummy breakfast in the morning. The riad is right in the centre of the Medina and very easy to get to the port and the beach.  Definitely reccommend Les Matins Bleus!"
"If you want value for money, friendly helpful staff,charming furnishings/colours/rooms that reflect the area and are spotlessy clean etc then you cannot go wrong. Stayed here for a week in March and could not fault it ! Indeed I wouldn't stay anywhere else if I ever go back."
"Super location in the medina but only minutes from the beach, sea, harbour. Close by but away from the hubbub of town we found it a really good location. 
Spot itself has super comfy rooms on landings around a cental courtyard, lovely breakfast & all the help you need from the brothers.
Local buses north & south gave for brilliant day long ambles along the coast, just don't miss the last bus back"
"Stayed 2 nights in this lovely hotel around Christmas time.  From the friendly welcome when we arrived everything about the stay was wonderful.  
There were just two of us, but we were out in the 'apartment' - two double beds and a sitting area - which would be fantastic value for a family or group staying together. (and we just paid the price of a standard double!)
Breakfast on the lovely terrace is included in the price."
"Tucked down a back alley-way in the Medina, Hotel Les Matins Bleus is a really charming typical Moroccan Dar. The accommodation is arranged around the courtyard, and breakfast is taken on either  the roof terrace or downstairs in the courtyard itself.
We stayed in a double room, which was a little on the small side, but nevertheless, fine for a short stay. The larger studios – at a higher price – appeared to have quite a lot more space, but then accommodating more people. Everything is well maintained and spotlessly clean.
Breakfast was always very good, and the staff cannot be faulted – friendly, polite, helpful – ideal hosts.
Highly recommended!
On a general note, we last visited Essaouira some 6 years ago, when the town was experiencing problems with its ancient sewage system – parts of town were simply no go areas! Well, on entering the Medina this time, we were greeted by a JCB digging up part of the main road – yes, they are repairing the sewers at last – so don’t be too surprised if you find major works going on in any part of the old town – just watch where you step!!!"
"My daughter and I took a break to Marrakech , for a 'special ' birthday i had a few years ago. We decided to take a breather from the hussle and bustle, and took the bus to Essaouira for a couple of nights. We earmarked a modest riad, but did not book, but when we arrived there it was closed for some plumbing work. The female owner recommended Les Matins Bleus to us, so off we trotted , wondering where we were heading, as mentioned elsewhere it is at the end of a small , unlikely looking alley. 
We were made most welcome, given free hot drinks on our arrival ( it was January) and given a family suite when we asked for a twin rather than double room. This was very comfortable, and we couldn't believe how reasonably priced it was. 
The owners were most helpful with information, directions and suggestions for places to eat in the evenings. 
I would definately return, and wouldn't hesitate in recommending it to anybody looking for good standard budget accomodation."
"Really liked this place and enjoyed my stay in Essaouira all the more for it.
Had a lovely room (booked a single - when I arrived they said i could stay in the double for the same price for the first 2 nights). The staff (or owners - 2 brothers) were so helpful and genuine. I used to manage 4-5* hotels and these guys could have tought my staff a thing or 2 about true hospitality."
"It's tucked down a rather unattractive lane, just off a minor touristy street but don't let that put you off. The entrance seems guarded by a rather large but friendly cat but inside is a little calm oasis.

The ground floor has a variety of snugs and rooms; there are books, a stereo with an expansive cd collection and free internet access. The owners offered a warm, yet unobtrusive service advising on all things local and beyond. 

Our room on the roof was pleasant and large enough, spotlessly clean with a regular maid service. There is a roof terrace to sit in the morning sun. It also has a washer and lines for those long term adventurers who are travelling light and need to refresh their wardrobe.

Breakfast was OK; bread, a pain au chocolat and pancake, served with wonderful fresh orange juice.

Quirky, honest and unique. Well worth a visit"
"When we arrived at Les Matins Bleus it was just after a massive downpour, and the hotel was flooded! Staff were very apologetic and brought us some mint tea, and it was soon dry. The room we had was a good size - fairly basic, but good for the price. The staff were very friendly and helpful, bringing us a radiator to dry our wet clothes and lending us an umbrella! Breakfast was very generous.

It was a shame we saw Essaouria and Les Matins Bleus in the rain as I'm sure this would be an especially nice place in the sunshine - there's a great roof terrace. We had a very comfortable stay, and I would recommend it for its good value and great location."
"Although this may not happen to you, the hotel put us up in one of their suites at no extra charge because they had no more doubles available. The hotel location is excellent, right inside the old fortress walls. The rooms are nice, and each one seemed to have its own character. The hotel staff/owners was extremely friendly, and offered up helpful tips on carpets and restaurants. Would go back again in a heartbeat."
"Sadly we had only one night at Les Matins Bleus but we loved this friendly little hotel. The staff are super-friendly and nothing is too much trouble. Breakfast is basic but hearty and will set you up for the day. Architecturally it's gorgeous.

We had two rooms up on the roof - small, clean, rather basic, but fabulous value. The location at the heart of the medina is just perfect and I certainly intend to go back,"
"You won't find a better place to stay in the medina. Lovely people, excellent facilities and a good breakfast. Thoroughly recommended."
"LMB used to be a family home, and you could sense that from the moment you step inside. It has that certain charm only a home can exude – the organised clutter, the lived-in, laidback feel. Nothing “sterile” about this place – everything is genuine and lively, from the decor to the proud hosts – Samir, Youseff and Khalid. The rest of the staff is equally lovely, always with a smile to spare.  
The room we had on the terrace was clean and basic, but bright and airy. The furnishings are simple by Moroccan-riad standards, but was a welcome break from the heavily-zellij-ed walls, ceilings and tables, tassled pillows and curtains, lovely as they were, that we had gotten used to by then. We kept the windows open even at night to let the breeze in and to listen to the seagulls, and had our best sleep in Morocco right here. 
LMB is a pleasant walking-distance to anywhere in the medina – the scenic Skala, the intriguing mellah, the Parisian-style cafes, the Ensemble Artisanal and the busy harbour, are all reachable in 20 minutes tops, including the beach. Make Bab Dakkala your point of reference, and you’ll most unlikely to get lost. In any case, Samir or Youssef at LMB will give you a verbal orientation of the medina on your first day and supply you with a map, in case you do.
My main concern then was how far we’d have to walk from the Supratour bus terminal to LMB (no motorised vehicles allowed within the medina). Thankfully, not far – approximately 10 minutes and with the ever-present porters (with surprisingly clean push-carts!) at the terminal, lugging your luggage through the cobbled and sandy streets of the medina is the least of your worry. Be prepared to pay 20 dirhams for the services. 
This may sound cliché, corny even, but there’s really no other way of describing LMB other than it really is, a home away from home!"
"I was in Les Matins Bleus for about a week in September 2011. I was travelling solo and I higly recommend the place. Very well located in the heart of the Medina but easy to acces at. 5 min walk to the beach. Free wifi everywhere in the hotel. Rooms impecably clean and well decorated and delicious breakfast. Last but by no means least all the staff is very friendly and helpful."
"The martins bleus is a lovely Riad! The rooms are very clean and nicely decorated. We stayed in one of the Suites, which has a spacious living room and  a clean bathroom. The terrace is a relaxed place to hang out, and even have your breakfast (which is nice and fresh). The staff, three young guys, is absoloutely amazing. They are very warm, welcoming and make sure that you have the best time in their Riad. 
The Martins Bleus definitly made our stay in Essouira even better!"
"Mid September 2011, I have spent 6 days in this Riad in the centre of the old city and it was great! Although in the middle of the lively streets, the Riad itself was very quiet and relaxing, all people working there very friendly and helpful and the room was very clean. Les Matins Blue is part of the good memories I have from Essaouira. When I go back to Morocco, Les Matins Blue for sure is on the list of places to stay! 
Peter, The Netherlands"
"The Riad is a nice and clean hotel with a family atmosphere. It is located centrally but calm at the end of a blind alley (cul-de-sac road) which takes getting used to. But, don’t hesitate to test the riad – it’s a real pleasure to be at this relaxing place.
The brothers Abdellatif and Samir support and help you unsophisticatedly and in an open-minded way with many questions and enquiries (e.g. about the history of the Riad, the best traditional massage in town, the restaurants, bars and shopping opportunities, but also when you need to change flight bookings). 
We felt absolutely comfortable there and can recommend the Riad without hesitation.
Franziska & Holger"
"This is a lovely, clean, safe, charming place to stay."
"Impeccably clean &  lovely Ryad , perfect for the seaside . it is family run in a very easygoing way & you are made to feel completely at home . Small & cosy , lovely colors through out & not overburdened with
pseudo moroccan knick knacks. The food is lovely as well and we should have eaten there most evenings instead of saving it for the last day. Breakfast is served overlooking the patio where you could just pass the time of day ..Perfectly located in the Medina                       &very easy of access. We chose it because of the photos on their site & were not disappointed.
Moroccan music , secret corners , perfect staff ...We loved it ."
"Very friendly and welcoming staff.  They took time to chat with you and were able to help with your stay.  Rooms were basic but all you needed and the hotel had a nice terrace as well as space on ground floor to chill out in with free wi-fi.  It was a very central location with the medina and the beach.  Good value and highly recommended.

Had a meal at the hotel and really enjoyed it.  We were able to go into the kitchen and the chef talked us through her preparation of the Tajine.  We were even given a clipboard to make notes!!"
"I travelled together with a friend in Morocco, and Essaouira was our first stop during the last few days of March.  This is SUCH a friendly, convenient and peaceful small hotel in which to stay, very reasonably priced too.  The staff go out of their way to be helpful, and the rooms are simply and tastefully furnished plus immaculately clean.   The breakfasts on the terrace are delicious, and the convenience of being right in the centre of the medina is a big plus - just a few yards from a dozen small restaurants, the little shopping streets, the harbour, souks, and beach.  Don't be put off by the rather grotty little alleyway that it's at the end of, once inside the central courtyard is peaceful, cool and filled with plants and interesting art..  When I return to lovely Essaouira I shall stay here again."
"I went to Essaouira last week with my boyfriend and I spent two nights in the hotel.
The people working there they are really nice and helpfull. The hotel is beautiful and really colorfull. They have a beautiful ""Salon du thé"" where there is always amazing music playing. The breakfast simple but really nice. 
We were in a room in the terrace. For the price we paid we had a normal size room with 2 beds (no double beds available) a little table with 2 chairs and a fantastic bathroom with really nice shower. 
The location is great too.
I recommend it to everybody!

Mariona (London)"
"I expected to be disappointed with this hotel as we had just stayed at a fantastic place in Marrakech. I was happy to be proved wrong.
The hotel is in the heart of the Medina, down a quiet street.
It is beautifully decorated with secluded areas downstairs for dinner and drinks.
Our room was a suite, which was lovely but did not have a bath, the sofa was small and uncomfortable and the second ""bedrooom"" in the suite was really just a bed placed on an open mezzanine level. So make sure you only share a suite with close friends/family and don't value your privacy!
Our friends' double room was very small  and none of the rooms appeared to have a safe, despite having to hand in our room key to reception every time we went out.
The way Riads are designed in Morocco means that there are few windows, so the rooms can be a little dark and damp/stuffy. But you have to weigh up the pros and cons of staying in a typical Riad/Dar compared to an air-conditioned but soulless modern hotel.
The staff were helpful and let me borrow a hair dryer for the duration of my stay. Internet was free.
Would I stay here again? Maybe.
Remember that no taxis are allowed in the Medina, which is nice after coming from the dangerous chaos of Marrakech, so get a man with a trolley at the bus stop.
Another tip is to book your bus in and out of Essouira ahead of time and always instruct trolley drivers exactly where you need to go as there is more than one bus station."
"Les Matins Bleu instantly felt like a home from home. 

The staff were very helpful and friendly, and it was nice to stay in a family run Riad with a family history. The location was perfect, right in the middle of the medina and yet peaceful and quiet, with the harbour and it's fish stalls only a few minutes away. 

The atmosphere was very relaxing, with the courtyard of the Riad a very lovely place to sit and rest. 

All in all this is a wonderful place to stay, and one of the cheapest too.."
"We spent a very relaxed long weekend in Essaouira, staying at Les Matins Bleus, & found the staff to be consistently friendly, helpful & courteous. 
The central courtyard or riyad was beautifully decorated in traditional style & the sitting rooms leading off from this were comfortable, cosy & atmospheric. The breakfasts which we ate in the courtyard were wholesome & appetizing  & the candlelit evening meal we had was delicious, & cooked for us expertly by Myriam the talented chef. The mainly young staff had a passion for Arabic & West African music, which contributed to a calm & cultured ambiance too. 
Our room on the roof terrace was tastefully but simply furnished, with a sturdy comfortable bed, local rugs adorning the tiled floor, & ample clean en-suite facilities with well-functioning plumbing, & plentiful hot water provided by solar heaters. Other rooms which we glimpsed from the riyad had more lavish furnishings, with 4 poster beds, sitting areas & mezzanine  bed platforms.
 The staff were caring but relaxed, & seemed to enjoy their work, & to take pleasure & pride in advising & helping us to make the most of our stay in the characterful attractive fishing port of Essaouira."
"Charming place, clean rooms, multilingual staff, simple yummy breakfast, and I was even able to check my email on the Riad's computer.  I was traveling with my 84 year old mother and 20 year old daughter. we were all thrilled. Highly recommend this place to others."
"We spent five nights at this lovely place, the first two in their apartment next door because the riad was fully booked (we had booked only a few days before our stay).  Whilst the apartment was functional and clean it was perhaps more suitable for a group/family having two double beds and being self contained - it left us feeling a little cut off from life in the riad.  
We just loved the atmosphere in the riad with people of all nationalities chatting in the communal areas.  Our room and bathroom were clean and well maintained.  Breakfast was good and typical of those we had in Morocco - hot drinks, breads, preserves and fresh orange juice - is it fair to ask for items not typical of the area to be included in the breakfasts?  We ate a delicious, reasonably priced dinner in the riad following a lesson in tagine cookery with Myriam.  We particularly enjoyed using the lounge areas to relax, read and listen to the traditional music - lovely after full days of sightseeing.  In other riads we stayed at the ground floor rooms had been converted into additional bedrooms which we felt robbed them of the atmosphere that so attracted us to Les Matins Bleus.  
The riad is very central and we felt it gave us a good experience of the local life and culture.

Most of all we felt that enthusiasm of all of the staff made this the favourite riad of our stay in Morocco."
"We had an excellent five days here with two young children. The team could not havebeen more friendly or helpfull. The rooms were spotless and wlll equiped, and very good value for money. The Opertunity to cook dinne with the chef was a great experience and the food was impecible. Couldnt recomend it more"
"We felt totally at home here. The staff could not have been more friendly or helpful, and the communal spaces of the riad are set up so that you feel comfortable just chilling out. Our room was sweet - simply decorated and clean, although it might have been good to have a window in the bathroom. Really well located, bang in the middle of the old town, but totally quiet at night. Loved it!"
"Les Matins Bleus has been quite an island in a town we didn´t like that much. Very efficient and very friendly staff, quite an unsual easiness ! The place was extremely tidy, beeing cleaned every day . Bed linens and towels were changed daily and the room was thoroughly cleaned, too. Breakfast was standard ( coffee, tea, pancake, jam, honey,bread, butter, fresh orange juice), some fresh fruits and eggs would be nice ! Dinner prices are reasonable. Rooms are a bit smelly because of the damp of the air.
No one was pushy as usual, there were not the usual offers of tours, restaurants, shops ! A place to relax, to meet easy people, to speak many languages. And : the best music !"
"We stayed three nights in Les Matins Bleus and it really made our stay in Essaouira.  You would be hard put to find a more comfortable and pleasant hotel for this price.   The staff are so friendly and hospitable that you feel as if you are in a home rather than a hotel.   Thoroughly recommended for adult solo travellers or families with children."
"This was a really nice and clean Riad. The rooms are lovely decorated and the staff are really relaxed and friendly, almost as if staying with friends. It is centrally located and quiet. It is great to have breakfast on the roof top terrace. Breakfast is massive and really nice. I want to go back now!"
"This place was overall excellent. It was beautiful, the service was great, the food was great, it had character, and generally everything you want. Overall during our Morocco trip we stayed in 5 riads, and this was my favorite. I really liked the other guests that were there, and I can't overemphasize how nice the staff was. 

HOWEVER, there was one big problem. We booked rather late, and before we arrived we were notified that our room (room five) did not have its own bathroom, but had a separate bathroom adjacent, but that this bathroom was reserved only for this room (with a sink and mirror in the room itself). Okay, not a problem. The room was also tiny-- again, something I could live with. The unacceptable thing was that the room had a terrible smell of mildew and was overall very dank. The thing is that Essaouira is a very damp place, being a seaside town and all, and if you have a room with no windows and no ventilation it ends up being miserable. All the other rooms seemed very nice except this one. The staff acknowledged the problem and admitted that they knew about it and that despite cleaning, etc, and since I have allergies and asthma they didn't charge us any cancellation fee or anything when we opted to stay elsewhere. One of the staff members was also extremely helpful and nice in calling around to other places to see who had a room. 

So overall, great place, just don't stay in that room. And frankly, I don't think they should continue to use the room for guests. It should really just be a large closet-- it's about that size, and it gives guests a negative impression of what is otherwise a really nice place."
"Ignore any hustler who tries to get you into his hotel but treat yourself instead to Les Matins Bleus because it’s a great place.  The rooms are elegant and spotless, the common rooms are cosy and atmospheric, breakfast tastes delicious and the helpful staff makes you feel at home.  
If you have the time, join Meryem for a cooking workshop or just enjoy a meal.
Next to this all, the hotel is situated ideally in the heart of the medina and just on a 10 minute walk both to the bus station as to the beach."
"Very nice staff, good admosphere, good food, nice rooms (especially the suites)"
"With only one night to spend in Essaouira, and a limited budget, my choice for an affordable room to stay in was fairly straight forward. I received a prompt and friendly response in English from the hotel staff who offerd me a single room with private bathroom outside of teh room, at a very reasonable price. On arrival, I struggled slightly to find the hotel (there were discrepancies between the map supplied by the hotel and the one on Google Maps - the latter turned out to be incorrect!). It is situated in the heart of the medina and can only be reached by foot. People on the street seemed to know the location, and directed me to the spot. The entrance is in an alley off the main street which means it does not get the main street sounds; the alley was a bit dirty from rennovations. The hotel is compact but very nicely decorated, cosy and comfortable, especially the lounge area. The sound of local music, and the friendly staff immediately made me feel at home. They showed me to my room and pointed out the ammenities. The room was basic, but clean and well worth the price. It does not have a window and I had some trouble locking the room door but a staff member came to help me with this. A swallow's nest with three chicks was located just outside my door in the square. Their chirping could be heard throughout the square - at first I thought this would disturb me but actually it was soothing and early the next morning, blended with the sounds of gull soutside, and the soft sound of waves made it part of everything essentially Essaouira. I slept very well in the cool room, despite a brief spell of praying/singing from the Mosque next door. I appreciated the small notice in English explaing that Morocco is a water scarce country and that showers should not be too long, and that water is heated by the sun and the hot water may not be available late at night. I did not try the dinners offered, although saw other quests eating. The Continental breakfast that was served to me on the terrace was great with excellent coffee. The rooms opening on the terrace should be very nice to stay in. While enjoying breakfast, a staff member showed me one of the swallow chicks that had fledged. He carefully placed it in a spot safe from preying gulls - the parent swallows found the chick there.

The hotel gave me an authentic experience in the heart of Essaouira. I could have spent much more time there, and it was ideal for exploring the markets and scenes within the walls of the city, with a safe and cosy place to retreat to after walking around the whole day. The people there were very friendly and sincere. I would especially recommend it for younger travellers, although other guests I saw seemed to be of a retired age."
"Our stay at Les Matins Bleus simply could not have been better - the staff in particular made the experience brilliant, being helpful and courteous at all times. They arranged a reasonably priced taxi to pick my girlfriend and I up from marrakech airport, and when we arrived I must say I was a little intimidated by the stinky alley which the Riad is located on, but my worries were alleviated the minute I walked through to door. The Riad is cool, clean, and pleasant smelling, in total contrast to the streets outside! 

The staff were very welcoming and friendly, and nothing was too much trouble for them, I even got walked to the nearest pharmacy when my girlfriend fell ill. Miriams cooking was exceptional and very reasonably priced, I would encourage everyone to eat here at least once.

Our room was small and basic, but perfectly clean and suited to our needs. The room was thoroughly cleaned every day. There was always enough hot water.

The roof terrace is a great place to relax and get away from the madness of the medina, and the riad felt safe all night as it has a night watchman who was always around.

For such a cheap Riad I was pleasantly suprised, and the staff here made my first trip to Morocco memorable."
"We stayed here for two nights in a bedroom on the roof terrace. While the rooms are not super big, they are really nicely decorated, as is the whole house. Lovely bright pastel colours with coloured glass above each door, and a traditional berber stting area. We had dinner in the riad one night, which is well recommended (I think 90 dirham for 3 courses), A bonus is that you can actually go into the kitchen and watch it being prepared, ask lots of questions and get the recipes. (A smattering of french might be useful for this, otherwise some of the cousins speak English). A nice breakfast, again on the roof terrace, fresh orange juice/ hot drink/ pastries/ bread and jam/honey.  All the staff are really lovely and there is a really good feeling of family and teamwork."
"i really enjoyed staying here for 4 nights. i wandered off the bus from marrakech with no reservations and the owner was very accommodating, as the single room was occupied, so he gave me deal on a great double room situated on the roof. one night later, he helped me move my things down to the single room with a detached bathroom and it was equally wonderful. the beds were comfortable, the showers were hot, the hotel was blissfully quiet, and the staff was wonderful. there is a curfew, so make sure you aren't caught out late like i once was! i would love to stay here again the next time i'm in essaouira."
"I stayed here last May 17-19, I just spent two nights and this place is perfect to stay in if you are a solo traveler on a budget.  The room I stayed in is a single room with private detached bathroom.  The room is basic but very clean. The courtyard and restaurant area are very cozy.  The owners are very helpful and friendly, one of them helped me to arranged a room massage as I was too lazy to go out and get a massage in one of the spa."
"Charming little place in the Medina.  It really was a refuge.  The staff were helpful and friendly and we felt very much at home and decided to stay an extra night.  The rooms are small but comfortable.  The breakfast was lovely and served to you on the main floor or the terrace which was so bright and pleasant in the morning."
"I stayed at Les Matins Bleus for 2 nights with my mother (63 yo), my siblings and their spouses, and a friend, in April 2010. The location couldn't be better - right in the middle of the medina, but down on an alley that granted us silence. Perfect! The rooms were clean and lovely. Downstairs they have this wonderful and cozy room where you can relax, listen to music, play games or whatever.  The young cousins who own the place are very friendly and nice, and they really make every effort for their guests to be comfortable and enjoy their stay. We particularly enjoyed the breakfast served in the terrace.

We saw in the guest book that the chef, Myriam, was highly recommended, so we ordered dinner one night (you have to let them know before noon, as they go to the market and shop all the ingredients fresh for your dinner). At 7 pm we arrived to find a wonderful table set with impecable taste in a private, cozy room. The first course was a mezze of olives, vegetables with incredible seasoning, potatoes with cheese, etc. The different tajines of the main course were absolutely the best we tasted in our 2-week stay in Morocco. I think about it and my mouth melts! Mine was meat with apricots and almonds, a sweet tasting, wonderful tajine that I am trying to reproduce at home! My friend had a vegetarian one and my mom had a lemon chicken one. They all loved what they had. The desert was a home-made pastry with apple. The best meal we had in Essaouira! 

We all enjoyed our stay a lot and will go again to Les Matins Bleus if we ever go again to Essaouira, city that we really loved."
"We loved our stay at Les Matins Bleus. About 12 rooms in a restored riad down a sidestreet, right in the heart of the old town, 5 mins from the seafront. Super-friendly staff, breakfast served on the roof terrace, good optional meals to order. Very reasonable rates, clean and bright rooms with en suite bathrooms."
"Just spent two very relaxed nights in Essaoira at this charming and easily found hotel.  Run by a small, very attentive and friendly team ""where everything is possible"" makes your stay in this beautiful seaside resort 'a must' if you fancy a break from the hustle and bustle.  The in-house home cooked food was great value and of a high standard.  Tell the owners Rachel and Andy say hello."
"My husband and I stayed at Les Matins Bleus for 5 nights and were extremely impressed by it.  It was kept spotlessly clean and was a beautiful building.  However, the most striking thing was the staff.  Without exception, the staff at the hotel were incredibly charming and helpful and made the stay extremely memorable.  If we return to Essaouira, we would have no hesitation in staying at this hotel again and would heartily recommend it to friends and family."
"Would like to say thanks very much to Abdel, Samir, Youssef, Meryem, Fatima Bouchra, Fatima and Aziz at Les Matins Bleus for making our stay so comfortable.

This old school building is set up with a lovely calm atmosphere easy to come and go from in a great location with helpful people on hand. It seems hard to find a bad location in Essaouira and Les Matins Bleus is no exception, easy to locate and the souks are close by.

We had a lovely stay and would definitely visit again."
"This delightful family run hotel immediately feels like home, thanks to its size and the warmth of the welcome.  Despite being tucked away down an alleyway, it's perfectly placed for exploring the medina as well as the beach and port.  Our room was simple but spotless, and the intimate and atmospheric sitting area is a great place to relax.  In fact, everyone at Les Matins Bleus did everything to create a relaxed and comfortable stay - never intrusive but always on hand to help where necessary, you really will feel more like a house guest than a paying visitor.  Breakfasts were a good start to a day of exploring - and make sure you enjoy one of Meryem's delicious dinners during your stay.  Great value"
"Brilliant - great staff, great location & great breakfasts !"
"great collection of international music in the laid back intimate lounge area;  the spotlessness of the rooms and showers;  the reliability and accuracy of the ‘outside’ services provided by the hostel;  the hosts fluent English making  it so much easier for non Arabic/French speakers to find their way to the things that are of interest to them; the wonderful ‘soul’ food cooking lessons with Meryem; and the choice of breakfast served either in your room, the terrace or patio, it’s amazingly quiet location in the heart of the medina and the SMILES of the hosts!"
"Great people with a fantastic understanding of what the European/western customer desires. 
The best accommodation we stayed in, the crew are a mine of information regarding Morocco, especially Essaouria and surrounding area, and can arrange trips, tours, transport without ""overselling"" it.
Thank you to Abdel, Samir, Meryem, Natalie and Aziz, we'll pop in and see ya next Jan-Feb, imshallah!"
"after 2 years we came back to morocco and essaouira.we stayed again in les matins bleus for 3 nights. It was like coming home; friendly staff, clean, good food and relaxing. The new salon and terras are so relaxing. and wifi makes it easy to write to friends how good your holiday is!
we would definitly recommend going to essaouira and staying in this hotel. hopefully we can come back soon."
"Very clean and cheap hotel, I had a 4 poster-bed!! Definately recommend, good service, lovely public rooms and terrace. Cannot possibly go wrong for the price. Breakfast was good too."
"My husband and I had such a wonderful stay at this beautiful riad. It is in a great location (dont be put off by the alleyway which takes you to the front door) just minutes walk from the sea front. We ended up staying for a week, but wish it had been longer. The rooms are a good size and beautifully decorated. Breakfast is included and very good - pastries, home made pancakes with jams etc and boiled eggs on request! 

The riad is family run but Abdel, Samir and Yussuf (2 brothers and a cousin). They made us feel exceptionally welcome and we became good friends with them, even having a cooking lesson from the extremely talented Myriam!

If we ever go back to Essouira we will definitely be staying here again.

Thanks for a wonderful stay :)"
"This is a clean, well-run riad run by two brothers and their cousin in what was formerly their family home. The location is excellent and the rooms clean and well-kept. Keep in mind that depending on the weather, rooms can feel a bit damp because the walls are thick stone and there are no windows. The downstairs lounge area is comfortable and cozy. We found it a very relaxing place to have tea and read in the afternoon or in the evening. Breakfast was an assortment of pastries, bread, coffee/tea and juice. I'd stay here again. The price is certainly right."
"This is the second time my family and I have stayed here.  Again we weren't disappointed.  Great location, beautiful hotel environment, high standards of cleanliness and most impotantly...fantastic staff.  Nothing was ever a problem and all the staff were very friendly and very helpfull. The hotel also provides a very good value evening meal, cooked by Miryiam, which was the most scrumptous food we ate in Essaouria. The hotel is excellent value and I would not hesitate to return for 3rd time."
"We spent a few nights at this hotel on our recent holiday to Morocco, after finding it in the 'budget' section of the Lonely Planet guide.  The staff were very welcoming and the atmosphere in the hotel, and in Essaouira generally, was really laidback and relaxed, a welcome relief after the constant hassle we got in cities like Fez and Marrakech.  The rooms were basic but clean, the bed was comfy and the shower was the best we experienced in Morocco.  Although there is a laundry service, there is also an area on the roof terrace for guests to dry their clothes, which came in very handy for us at the end of a long trip."
"Spent three nights at the Les Matins Bleus 20th-23rd Sep Great place to stay.central to 
 every thing .
 Loverly place run by loverly people.

 Graham& Louise Baylis"
"We stayed in the ""suite"" which had two double beds, one on a small mezzanine level and the other in a separate side room. Both were meticulously cleaned during each day we stayed. The staff were very friendly and it felt more like staying in someone's house than in a hotel. No air conditioning here but Essaouira is quite a cool town anyway so not really necessary. The included breakfast was good and the price was definitely right. And finally, the location is superb - right in the centre of the Medina (old town) down a quiet dead-end street; you can walk to anywhere in the Medina within 5 mins at the most."
"Our visit to Essaouria and Les Matin's Bleu was the highlight of our two week holiday in Morroco. The outstanding friendliness of the staff made us feel welcomed & at home in this beautiful riad. 

Situated in the heart of the town you are moments from the hustle and bustle of shops, restraunts, the sea and souks. Walk inside and it's very chilled out with a candlelit den, great for relaxing with a mint tea, or go upstairs to sun bathe on the terrace. We had one of our tastiest meals here too and also had a little cooking lesson with Myriam which was very enjoyable, tagine heaven! 

Overall this is a clean, comfortable & good value riad with lots of charm.  A fab location with staff who go to extra trouble to ensure you have a great stay. Thankyou so much to all the staff for making our visit perfect!"
"My husband and me spend 4 wonderful days in essaouria (a beautiful city definitely worth a visit!!!) and stayed in this beautiful riad!  

it was definitely our best accomodation during our 3 1/2 weeks travel through morocco.  

The friendly and warm welcome and the refreshing colours, the simple, but lovely decorated room, the blankets, the tables, the roof terrace, the pictures... everything was really great!  the service was great, we got some good advices and bought great things in one of the shops recommended for a fair price!  cooking with miriam was just great and we learned a lot about moroccian food!  also spending time with yussuf (one of the brothers) was really relaxing and it was just really good to get to know more about the morrocian culture!  

the riad is in the middle of the medina in a quiet dead end road... you are in the middle of the action, but also in a relaxed and quiet place!

i can´t say what i liked most... i just liked everything about the riad.
spottless clean (cleaned every day).  european style bathrooms. a very good standard.
very cosy rooms, quite big for morrocian standard! a big bed, a table in the room and tables on the roof terrace and in the courtyard. 

the breakfast was amazing!  freshly baked treats from mirijam, croissants, etc.  
and they also observed very good - my husband and me e.g. did not like the bread so much, so the 2nd morning we bought a baguette to eat with the breakfast and the morning after we got baguette instead of the bread... very observing... 
they want to make you feel at home and want you to have a perfect stay!
the staff are very very helpful and friendly.
and the coffee is REALLY GOOD!!!! 

all in all i can definitely recommend this riad!  
if you want to have a great time in a beautiful city add this beautiful riad and your trip will be just perfect!!!!!"
"We have recently returned from a 5 night stay at les matins bleus and were very impressed. The 5 star rating I've awarded is in relation to what the riad offers for its price. Clearly it's not a luxury establishment, but the rooms were very clean with comfortable beds; the breakfast was very good and the location of the riad is perfect.

However, the staff are what really made the stay for us. Abdel, Youssef and Samir were happy to help at all hours and nothing was too much trouble for them. They helped us to arrange horse riding and kite surfing and were happy to give directions and recommendations to excellent local restaurants. I actually left a jacket in one of the local restaurants and they've been superb in helping me locate it and sending it back to me in the UK for me. I would really recommend this place to anyone - it's such fantastic value.

The best place I found for sunbathing in Essaouira was at the jardins de villa maroc - a bus goes from villa maroc every morning at 11 to a fabulous place in the countryside with gardens, a pool and beautiful lunch for 180DH. The pool at the riad zahra can also be used for 50DH per day."
"We stayed for three nights and found the hotel relaxing and fun.  There is certainly a buzz around the place that made it feel quite welcoming and informal.  The staff were helpful and friendly and the breakfast was lovely.  My only down side was the apartment we spent one night in had a slightly damp smell/  To be fair  we were probably more sensitive to this as we had recently stayed in Pension Sekaya in Fez which was totally damp and left our clothes and bags smelling for days.  Altogether we had a good stay at Les Matins Bleus and would happily stay there again and would happily recommend it to anyone.  Clean, friendly and comfortable."
"Stayed here for 3 nights.  Lovely place to stay.  Staff were incredibly friendly and helpful.  Had lovely evening meal cooked by Miriam.  Excellent location.  Would stay again and recommend to anyone"
"I stayed two nights at this wonderfull and relaxing place. I really enjoyed it. The staff is so nice and helpfull. Dinner at the hotel is great to do. Very tasty. You can help preparing dinner in the kitchen. Very nice to do! I would love to come back."
"We have had the most fantastic time both times we have stayed. Our first time was 3 years ago & we have never forgotten the brothers incredible hospitality. Nothing is ever a problem! Mariam's breakfast is absolutley delicious and if you fancy having dinner in her Tagine's are also fantastic! The rooms are very sensitively decorated & suitable for all types of travellers- families (suites available), surfers, couples. Essaouira is a welcome brake from the heat & hussle of Marrakech. Les Matins Bleus is within the old medina, everything including the beach is all within a 5 minute walk. Les Matins Bleus is a definate must! Hopefully we won't leave it 3 years before returning again!"
"Dar 'les matins bleus' is a peacefull and tranquil little gem in the old medina.
Autenticly restored,spotlessly clean, nicely decorated  and above all a discreet, helpfull and friendly staff.
Excellent value foor money."
"A group of six of us stayed in Les Matins Bleus for two nights as a brief escape from the madness of Marrakesh!  Incredibly well priced, the hotel was beautiful and the staff very welcoming and fluent in many languages including English.  The suites are a good size for four to share as long as you know each other pretty well (a family group or close friends).  Excellently priced with fabulously clean bathrooms and plenty of solar heated hot water, located in the middle of plenty of shopping and restaurants.  I'll be going back!

A very minor downside is that you'll probably need a ""man with a cart"" to get you from the bus stop to the hotel, expect to pay up to 50-60 dirhams (we had six suitcases between us for him to transport), if you tell him when you're leaving then he'll be waiting for you outside the hotel for you when you want to leave.  A taxi could get fairly close but not right up to the hotel."
"We stayed for 6 nights - March 15 to 21 - and had  a memorable and very pleasant stay in beautiful Essaouira. The hotel staff are superb, the rooms are bright, clean and very comfortable , the hotel is beautifully decorated and the room costs are extremely competitive. It is an excellent base to explore the town - in the heart of the Medina - and surrounding countryside and we wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone. J and R O'Dubhain - Ireland."
"We stayed at Les Matins Bleus for two nights, the owners were very friendly and the whole place had a welcoming feel.  The photos on the website don't do justice to how attractive the riad is. Stayed in the 'suite' which had a double bed in a separate bedroom and a double bed on a mezzanine level which was perfect for friends travelling together.  you can also have afternoon tea and cakes in the riad which was perfect after some serious shopping! the riad was relatively easy to find and very central"
"Central but quiet location close to beach. Clean rooms, the ones on the top floor are very bright and have access to the roof terrace. Very friendly staff. Good breakfast."
"This charming little Riad is full of character and friendly service - we felt instantly welcome and at home. The rooms are comfortable, nicely done up and very clean and the location in the heart of the Medina is perfect. Perfect for a short or even long stay in Essaouira, 30 sec walk into heart of medina and 6 mins to the harbour and beach. Highly recommended."
"I went to Essaouira with a friend who had booked to stay here. On our arrival I checked to see if they had space for me to stay and had the pleasure to be given the suite to share as obviously it hadn't been booked that night. The single room was 300 Dh and the suite cost us 300 Dh each compared to the normal high season rate of 900 Dh, so it was a real bargain. The room was great and included heating, which is very useful in winter plus lots of hot water and comfortable bed. The staff were very helpful as my friend had lots of questions about her onward travel. I was glad to finally get to stay there as I had tried to book previously but found them booked out."
"Amazing stay! We really loved this little Riad and were very sorry to leave. The family were so kind to our children (age 2 and 5) and made us feel extremely welcome. Our suite was spacious and comfortable, absolutely spotless and cleaned every day (as was the rest of the Riad) and probably more charming than we had anticipated. We would agree with other reviewers that the website doesn't do it justice. The traditional cushioned snug area is wonderful.

Essaouira is such a relaxing place. The Medina is bustling and full of life and yet much more chilled out than Marrakech. The beach is a bonus, there's a really interesting mix of people and a great atmosphere.

Although we have travelled lots since having children this was our first trip outside of Europe and it was a huge success, not least because of the generous welcome we received in Eassaouira and in Marrakech also. See our other review for Riad Maizie."
"We had a room on the rooftop and had a very pleasant stay.  The room was average sized for the price and it was very clean.  I do recall the shower being a little small, but it really didn't bother me.  The staff members were very friendly and the breakfast was pretty good.  The hotel is down a little alleyway, but in a very safe and central location.  We walked everywhere except to the non-touristy hammam place the owner suggested.  I would stay here again!"
"We booked our trip independently after reading reviews and were absolutely not disappointed!  

We arrived in the afternoon after a somewhat gruelling bus trip from Marrakech.  Grabbing a young lad with a cart we made the short walk to the Riad where we were met with big smiles and a really hospitable welcome - felt at home immediately.  

Our double room on the first floor was not exactly spacious, but was spotless, bright and had everything we needed for a 7 day stay.  We took our continental and plentiful breakfast both on the rooftop terrace and in the courtyard.  If you are arranging to stay here, you MUST have at least one dinner, cooked to perfection by Myriam.  Dinner will be served to you in one of the little rooms off the courtyard and you can bring your own wine to the table.

Compared to all the opulence of reds and golds and ornate tiling of most Marrakech riads, the simple blue and pink of Les Matins Blue is refreshing and very attractive.

What makes the riad perfection?  Undoubtedly the warmth and homely atmosphere effortlessly created by the three brothers.  Nothing was too much trouble, everything was casual and welcoming and I was genuinely really quite sad to say goodbye after our lovely week.

A good tip:  there is a wine and spirits shop just outside the medina walls and the local wine is good. A lot of cafe's and restaurants are alcohol free, but if you just want a beer or wine without eating, try the upstairs restaurant at the very end of the main square just before the walk onto the docks - La Bab Laachour.  The food is very good there and the waiters good fun.  There is also a rather tatty bar outside the walls at the start of the beach - whilst they made a fuss of me and wiped down the seat for me, it really is better for ladie to leave this one for the men...........!

So, Les Matins Bleu, will we return? You bet we will."
"My friend and I had a double suite, with a mezzanine and a double bedroom. It's a nice Riad, but compared to the place we stayed at in Marrakech it was quite basic (though a similar cost per night) - but it was clean and pleasant enough, though not sure about the alley leading up to it - which was often a minefield of cat poo!

The staff were friendly enough, but couldn't quite see what other reviewers raved about? Surely it's their job to be somewhat friendly and helpful?? 

I loved Essaouira and would go back there any time, but would probably try another Riad?"
"First of all i have to say how amazing the brothers that run this riad are! Due to some difficulties faced with a local bus service from Casablanca to Essaouria, we didnt manage to arrive at the riad until 2.30am in the morning. We were greeted with a big welcome and a smile and shown to our room for some much needed sleep. 

The breakfast on the terrace in the morning was delicious, and the service impeccible! I would reccomend this riad to anyone considering visiting Essaouria, as the location is great, the accomodation fantastic and the service you recieve from the hosts is above and beyound expectation!

A+++++++++++++++ all the way!

Thanks for a wonderful stay- we loved every moment!

"We stayed for 4 nights at the beggining of March and what a fantasic place to stay it was!  Definately the best accomodation we stayed in during our two week trip to Morocco. The owners and staff are all extremely helpful, kind and genuinely freindly!

Breakfast on the terrace was excellent and the evening dinner is definately not to be missed. We ate there on our last night and sampled the best Tajine of our trip (we had quite a few!) and at a very good price. 

Our room was absolutely spotless and was thoroughly cleaned every day, with fresh towels provided. The location is perfect - down a quiet dead end street and very quiet...Just what you need to relax and catch up on some sleep.

It was not the cheapest place we stayed at but definately offered the best value for money and I would thoroughly reccommend a visit!"
"My mother & I stayed at this riad for 3 nights. I booked directly with the Riad web site & received confirmations immediately. There are only 9 rooms at this riad & we stayed at a room on the terrace.  Its very quiet & all you hear are birds in the morning. This is a ""green"" riad as they use solar power to heat water & was a family home. The brothers serve you breakfast in the morning. Its more than plentiful with fresh squeezed orange juice, tea / coffee, chocolate croissants, breads, jams. English is spoken at this riad.
The riad is in a great location at a dead end street - we arrived by Supertours bus & got a caroosa (street cart carrier) to carry our luggage &  find the riad.
The place is all sky blue & white / simple decor - nice array of plants / flowers & is very peaceful."
"This riad is great!! Locaction, rooms, staff  - has it all. The people that run it are so nice, nothing is too much trouble for them. This is the perfect place to come and relax espically if you have come form Marrakech as we had done. Essaouira iteslf is very chilled out and this riad fits in perfectly. 5* place!"
"We stayed for three nights - the riad style hotel has a relaxed atmosphere, is very welcoming and nothing could be too much trouble for the family who run it.  Well located in Medina close to all shops, seafront and beach.  Don't expect super luxury or 5* facilities, but the rooms are simple, spotlessly clean and and comfortable.  Breakfasts were good - pancakes, bread and croissants with fresh orange juice and choice of hot drinks - and fantastic eaten at the tables on the roof.  

I made enquiries by email but probably better just to give them a ring to check availability and make a reservation - English is spoken fluently.  They took credit card details for the reservation but did not take any payment until we booked out.  They arranged for us to be picked up from Marrakesh airport and be taken direct to the hotel.  

Well-recommended.  

Essaouira is a great place to visit - long, marvellous beach and relaxed shopping was welcome after the challenges of Marrakesh.

"My fiance and I loved Les Matins Bleus.  After a long bus ride to Morocco (Supratours was easy to use and surprisingly clean), we were a bit unnerved by the alley leading up to Les Matins Bleus, but the riad was beautiful, the family that runs it is SO friendly and welcoming, and there is a great roof deck to enjoy if the weather is sunny.  This riad is a great value for the price.
"
"We stayed in one of the rooms on the terrace. It was gorgeous! and the brothers (the riad has been passed down four generations to Ahmed,Abdel and Samir who now run it) brought us breakfast on the terrace in the morning sun.
 
The location is extremely central, and the brothers were very welcoming- always inviting us down for mint tea. delicious! They even made the effort to take us out at night- and show us the local hot spots. I would fully reccommend it, for both young people and adults.

Simple and charming decor- in the traditional blue and white that you will see everywhere in essaouria
"
"We had a wonderful stay at this Riad. Ahmed and his brother were so welcoming. Our rooms were spotless and breakfast each morning on the roof was relaxing and fun. It is central to the fishing port and the Souks. Worth staying at for value.
"
"The three brothers at this hotel/guest house are fabulous, charming, impressively multi-lingual and will do everything to make your stay comfortable and wonderful. We had a pretty room, a 'continuation' room which is in fact a suite, and we loved the civilised but informal atmosphere of this place, the yummy breakfasts and the fab roof terrace. It was like staying in the home of friends, everything is very clean and put together with care and good taste. The very central location is great too, especially since on this occasion we were two women travellers. I go to Essaouira several times per year and  know it well. Having found this little gem, we will definitely stay again. It is also really good value for money.
Do note: Like for most riads, you do need to be mobile to get up the steepish stairs and if you are the type of visitor who expects a mini bar and room service, this is not the place for you either!
