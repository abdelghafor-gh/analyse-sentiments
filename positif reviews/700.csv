"Clean and quiet hotel, we booked bed and breakfast and the breakfast was great. Lots of choice and high quality food. 
We visited the Spanish restaurant on our first night and was served by Ilias, he was attentive, polite, knowledgeable and a pleasure to speak to. He is the reason we went back every night of our trip. 
We used the spa which was clean and tidy, I had a massage which was lovely. 
Would recommend this hotel."
"On checking in our luggage- it  failed to arrive so after an hour we went down to collect it. 
The rooms were clean and the bed was comfortable. 
Please note do not waste extra on booking a luxury room - they are all the same - only the luxury room was in the ground floor with better access and views of the gardens. 
Another aspect we did not expect was the high cost of alcohol at the hotel-  £7 for bottle of beer and £ 10 for a glass of wine or £ 25 for a bottle of wine. 
We unfortunately chose half board but I would recommend bed & breakfast as truly the evening meal was poor quality and the food barely warm. And there is a wide choice of great eateries locally. 
All the staff were friendly and professional and breakfast choice was good (buffet style)
On a positive - the hotel has chilled vibes great decks and lounging areas and great access to the beech which is great for surfing. 
Apparently the hotel is currently undergoing refurbishment which will improve the reception area and service.
Agadir souk in the centre of town is worth a visit and can just about
anything from herbal Viagra, jewellery, handbags, to getting your hair braided. The choice is yours! Agadir is still worth a visit and great for a short break."
"Excellent staff, always smiling and friendly. Outstanding houskeeping by Laila. Nice Pool area. 
Recommend a rental car to get around if you are comfrtable with driving in the busy streets of Agadir. With a car you can also go to Marrakech and also go to the attractions in and around Agadir."
"Great bed and rooms, renovated. Beach as well beatiful and private. 
The full complex is very clean. 
Beatiful garden. 
Dis not had the chance to visit the spa. 
Breakfast: Mohammed Sahli was super kind and pays attention on your needs. 
Latifa from réservations very helpful and with a great support during the Booking process."
"Stayed for five nights, following a long weekend break in Marrakesh. The hotel itself is beautiful, very well presented and extremely clean throughout. Food was great, and with good variety too, we ate in all three restaurants. Rooms were spacious and all amenities available - our room was freshly renovated only three months ago. 
The reason for only 4 out of 5 stars is the service. The service was frustrating. Some evenings we would be seated for dinner and 20 minutes would pass before we were offered a drink. Or we would order and then be waiting the same duration for them to arrive. The hotel was only around 50% capacity and there seemed to be more staff than guests, but most of which just stood around and glared at empty plates that needed clearing or scrolled through their phones. It was almost like each staff member was given a particular job (floor sweeper for example) and should you ask them for something that wasn’t part of that role, you’d be met with a blank expression, or told to ask someone else. We wondered how an earth they coped when the hotel was at capacity. 
Another issue we encountered during our stay was the understanding of ‘half board’ in the a la carte restaurants. You’re given an allowance of 380mad per person (which is plentiful I may add), but each night were expected to sign for the bill without this deduction from our food total. Again, such a frustrating matter. We mentioned this to one of the managers at the reception, fearing that when we checked out we would encounter the problem again, but thankfully on check out this had been rectified.
Such a shame that the service tainted our view of this hotel, as stated previously, the hotel itself is stunning and well maintained throughout."
"Absolutely amazing service hotel is perfect for family couples or solo. Pools food excellent spa is amazing and my room attendant Oumaima was fantastic very helpful and aimed to make sure my room was to full comfort🥰🥰🥰would definately recommend and return"
"Fantastic view and the staff is very friendly. Laila from housekeeping made us a beautiful 🩷 on our bed and helped us with the mosquitos. Majid helped us sorting out flights and was also very helpful. As our daughter was in hospital they were all very caring too. Gorgeous pools we would love to return when we have more time!"
"Beautiful hotel with fabulous pools and grounds. Lovely beach. Great staff, they couldn't do enough for you especially Adil who brought us English tea bags to our room on a regular basis - much appreciated!
If I was being picky, the only slight criticism is the lack of variation and variety at evening meal time, especially if you are vegetarian. The food was very nice be varied very little from evening to evening. Would definitely recommend the hotel for a quiet sunshine break."
"We had The most relaxing time, so quiet and peaceful. The hotel is luxurious really lovely and clean and amazing staff always around to help. Always somewhere to sit or lounge by the pool, on the beach or in one of the restaurants. Would defiantly visit again thank you especially Raja on reception and Fahma in housekeeping xx"
"Our trip to Morocco was unforgettable, and Khalil how was working in the hotel was a huge part of that! From the moment we arrived, Khalil went above and beyond to ensure every aspect of our trip was perfect. Whether it was helping us navigate through the city, suggesting hidden gems, or organizing activities, he truly made everything seamless. His knowledge, kindness, and attention to detail made us feel at ease throughout the entire journey. Sofitel Agadir Thalassa Sea & Spa hospitality turned a great trip into an exceptional experience. Highly recommend if you're planning to explore Morocco! 

Special thanks to Mr Khalil."
"Had an enjoyable session in the spa. I was taking care of first by Zamira with the glasses for the hamam and then Zamira for the message. They were both exceptional. Facilities were also good as were the reception staff. Has sea views for relaxing pool was great  drank some very sweet green tea also."
"Best hotel in Agadir, professional staff, best service, very friendly staff, good choice of breakfast , the swimming pool are nice and not busy like other hotels, private beach access, on site parking , i have stayed here for 7 days and i enjoyed it. I regret changing my last days in the sofital royal bay as its not where near this one."
"I recently went with a group. It was my first time at the hotel. All the staff were accommodating, and the hospitality was amazing. Our host, Khalil, was a true gentleman. He was determined to ensure our stay and experience were one we would remember. He was attentive to our needs and made recommendations of where we could go to eat and/or party. He made travel arrangements for us, too.  The hotel staff were also lovely and paid attention to every detail. The rooms were cleaned, and the food was lovely. The pool servers were on hand to take our drink/food orders and provided us with towels. The security staff were friendly and all the staff greeted us with a smile. 

I'm recommending this to everyone because I had the best time!"
"My stay was truly exceptional.The service was top-notch, with a friendly and attentive staff catering to all my needs promptly. The food offered was delightful, especially the breakfast selection that offered a variety of delicious options.
Cleanliness was impeccable throughout the hotel, highlighting the commitment to hygiene. A standout was Khalil, the Guest Relation Manager, whose personalized and caring approach made my stay memorable.His helpfulness and dedication truly added a special touch to my experience ."
"We had 8 nights bed and breakfast at the Timoulay hotel & Spa
Very clean rooms, and big comfortable bed, friendly helpful staff 
The only downside was no tea coffee facilities in the room, the WiFi was good in reception and by the pool, but in the room kept dropping out
The pool is clean, but cold, the sea was warmer 
Minor points, it is a good hotel "
"I did like everything there best stay in Agadir
‘La plage’ everything was perfect there management, barman everyone

The management was so friendly barman also and all workers were too perfect 
Hard to believe that there is a hotel like this one in agadir 

Glad i am staying here"
"We are staying here at the moment for a week. We have a lovely comfortable suite which is being beautifully serviced daily by Zafira, who is ensuring we have daily complimentary coffee & milk etc… and leaving beautifully designed towels on the bed - today beautiful swans. 
The breakfast is tasty with lots of fresh fruits and sweet delicacies. You can ask for any type of eggs to be cooked. 
We ate the 1st night in Le Corail restaurant which was good (albeit here Paella Valenciana is seafood Not chicken & rabbit like my husband thought he was ordering which he eats regularly in Valencia Spain !) 

All in all we think it’s a lovely hotel , staff are friendly & food is good & room is fabulous. Our only gripe is two things : a lot of people around the pool seem to be on their phones constantly having loud conversations - we want peace when relaxing around the pool we don’t want to be forced to hear people chatting loudly on the phone / FaceTime . 

Finally - why are you charging ridiculous amounts for water 
Surely as a 5* hotel you should be providing your guests with enough drinking water free of charge in such a hot climate - or at least a price that is not extortionate!"
"my stay at SOFITEL THALASSA sea and spa from September 16, 2024 for three days with my son who has a sprained foot requiring special treatment, is taking place in very excellent conditions. I would like to thank all the staff I had the pleasure of meeting and who spared no effort to anticipate and satisfy our needs. I would especially like to thank Mr. Yacine from the reception for the perfect and warm welcome, Mrs. Zina the chambermaid for her dedication and her vigilance to alleviate the ordeal linked to my son's injury, Mrs. Hasna the housekeeper who was like a bee watching over all the details and needs of the guests.
basically I describe my stay as an experience to be relived as soon as possible.
five stars that I rate is below the deserved rating.
thank you all
Driss"
"I stayed 4 nights in your hotel and I felt like home. All the areas very clean and tidy, staffs very welcoming and worry all the time about me. Food delicious and the room extremely comfy. Special mentions: Khalil (day dutty manager very helpfull), Fatima from reception, Zahra Bouibker & Amhdar Samura( Spa), Hatim & Yaumess ( pool services), Mouna and Adil ( housekeeping) and Muhammad fron the buffe restaurante. DefinetlyI want to come back and for sure I'll recommend your amazing hotel to my friends. Good luck to all of you."
"Came here for a spa experience as my gf saw the hotel on instagram 
We were staying in a nearby hotel so popped in to book a Moroccan hamam and massage.
What can I say the staff were amazing, super friendly and accommodating. They knew we weren’t hotel guests but couldn’t do enough for us.
We had a delicious lunch at la plage restaurant, and they invited us to stay for the remainder of the day with full use of facilities.
When we finished lunch they escorted us to our private double sunbed.equipped with towels where we chilled and relaxed for the remainder of the day.
Next time we come to Morocco we will definitely be booking to stay here.
5 star treatment all round *****"
"Very good service lively atmosphere friendly , respectful staff, 

Room very clean and service was Perfect, would definitely recommend to others. 
 Khalil, Yusef and lamia brilliant service along with everyone else 

Will return soon with friends"

"I had a fantastic experience for birthday at this hotel. I was actually staying at another hotel but came here for a drink to celebrate my birthday. As soon as I came to the bar they had a dj playing and the manager Fatima, 
and the hostess Fatima zahrae were so welcoming. They checked on me all night and they were so friendly. The bar staff were excellent with their drinks and the time it took to serve. Khadija brought over a desert with a candle and the dj played the happy birthday song for me. They all encouraged everyone to dance. I came to here by myself but I never felt alone here. These women are fantastic they know what it means to give customer service and an excellent memorable experience. I will be staying at this hotel next time I come to morroco. They deserve all the praise they get ❤️"
"Had a wonderful time in this venue .such a good vibe and a very pleasant place . Very nice and kind personal. The staff went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and comfortable. Their kindness and attentiveness truly made our experience memorable especially mister Khalil who was very welcoming. Highly recommend!!!!"
"We went to Sofitel during this summer holiday in Agadir, it was outstanding experience, true standard 5 stars service, we liked very much the beach area, great atmosphere,nice music, great sea view and swimming pool, very clean, beautiful decoration, great service, the staff is very professional and customer-friendly ! big thanks to the team (Ahmed, Noureddin,Rabab,Housine,Ismael,Fatima Zahra and Mohamed) who made our experience wonderful !"
"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the hotel .everything was exceptional ,special thanks to khalil for his outstanding assistance during my stay. He was incredibly helpful and accommodating with all of my needs, ensuring that my stay was comfortable and stress-free. His excellent customer service skills are a real asset to your hotel and he should be commended for his efforts.i highly recommend it to anyone looking for a top-notch hospitality.Thanks again to Khalil and the rest of the staff for making my stay so memorable!"
"The hotel was lovely we had a suite overlooking pool and sea. It was well equipped and very relaxed. The location was great, by the beach and a great walk along the broad walk. Staff were very attentive and helpful. The beach bar was great, and very chilled even if we had to wait a wee while for service at times. Sun beds and pools were good. We ate at the Spanish Resturant which was lovely. Breakfast was good with plenty of choice and good service 
Overall really enjoyed our stay"
"**Hotel Review**

I recently stayed at  Sofitel for nearly a month with my family. While the location and accommodations were satisfactory, the limited dining options were a letdown. The friendly staff, including Fatima the wonderful manager in the restaurant, provided good service, but the breakfast and dinner menus lacked variety, feeling repetitive over our extended stay. Though the food quality was acceptable, the culinary choices felt uninspired and unable to accommodate our diverse tastes."
"In a great location just beside the beach, this very comfortable hotel has  three swimming pools and a stunning garden. The  buffet breakfasts were exceptional with a huge choice - cheeses, omelettes, crepes, cereals, fruit etc. But, as some other reviews have mentioned,  there were never any spoons even though there were different soups and yogurt on offer. Seems strange in such a well run hotel.Friendly staff and comfortable bedroom,we were very happy with our stay here."
"The investment in the external facilities of this hotel really makes it very impressive (pool area is spa like).  Additionally the staff really do go out of their way from a service perspective. They kindly extended our room stay from 12 to 3pm as we had our transfer arriving at 4pm. Little touches like this go a long way"
"I’ve been in the hotel twice and It was lit, the views, the service, everything was beyond my expectations . It’s definitely not gonna be my last time. 
I want to address a big thanks to mr khalil as well for his hospitality and professionalism."
"We loved the live music in the evening, the spa-smell, the entrance, the staff, pool, garden!! Very nice interiour design 
We didn’t have to leave the hotel to have a great time! Near the beach. Taxi available. Great food (thanks to the chef from the restaurant in the garden) 😊"
"The entrance, lobby are amazing, well designed and smells lovely, but when you enter the outside area with the pool and gardens, you feel happy! It is a large area but due to the many private spaces, Seats and amazing flowers and green, it does not feel massive. The pool is very stylish and not crowded, surrounded by lovely beds and corners. The beach restaurant also has a great vibe with nice lounge music. The staff is very friedly and the food is good."
"Sofitel Agadir Thalassa Sea & Spa. 

A Lovely hotel, clean & peaceful. the location isn’t too far out from the main centre if you’d like to explore and venture out. The guest relations manager khalil ensured I had everything to enjoy my stay. I would recommend this to anyone else travelling for business from the Uk."
"Best company with khalil , so elegant, excellent service and great price for the product , great view , delicious food and great service to customers in general as always with a good selection and quality product in general as a customer base and quality is always a plus to the company"
"This was our second stay at the hotel. Last year we went as a couple and this year with grown up kids. 
Both trips were faultless, the facilities were amazing as were the staff. 
We were greeted by a new member of staff called Khalil who was very enthusiastic and welcoming and told us everything we needed to know. 
The hotel restaurants were lovely as were the restaurants about a 30 minute walk along the promenade. 
We will definitely return as the value for money was also really good."
"The hotel exceeded our expectations! Immaculate rooms, friendly staff, and a prime location. The amenities were top-notch, with a sparkling pool and a well-equipped fitness center. Breakfast offered a wide variety of delicious options. We highly recommend this hotel for a comfortable and memorable stay. Can't wait to return!"
"This hotel is amazing with a great view I had a nice evening with my friends and the vibe here is great just like the hotel the decoration also is amazing   . I recommend  this hotel to every lost person in the city with your partner or ur family or ur friends ❤️❤️ I lovee this place so much"
"Disappointing stay. While the lobby area looked promising, our room was dated and poorly maintained. The AC unit was noisy, and the bathroom had mold issues. Service was lackluster, with long waits for simple requests. On top of that, the parking fees were exorbitant. There are far better options in the area for the price we paid."
"Perfect spot with a great service! 🎉
Awesome view and vibe. I came with friends and it was a good experience. friends and it was a good experience. 
Perfect spot with a great service! 🎉  Thanks to Khalil and Katia for their hospitality! Perfect spot with a great service! 🎉"
"The bar at the hotel was really nice, had good times with friends... i would definitely come back whenever i get a chance 💯 the crew is very friendly (especially Khalil), the view is fantastic (try it during sunset), music is chill, drinks are great... so i would recommend it to anyone visiting Agadir"
"A really nice resort, just could be so much better. The positives are cleanliness, location, the pool, the beach, the sunbeds, this is all really nice, but...
Hit & miss with the staff, mainly good but a few let it down. It took 45 mins to checkin which was frustrating (left with offer of tea and just so slow when not busy, and after 15:00 check in time). 
Really expensive, food in spanish-themed restaurant was nice, but not value for money, alcoholic dreams are not value for money. £3.50 for a small bottle of water round the pool.
They also advertise restaurant offers, we checked the ""T&Cs"" (which are not shown on the screens), and then the staff renege on the offers when it comes to trying to take advantage.
So, our advice for staying there. Enjoy the resort, in the evenings don't be afraid to venture out. Walk to beach bar and turn right out resort onto promenade. 2km/30 mins pleasant walk along the ocean front will take you to 4 really nice restaurants at far better value. 
What could be a nice 5 star experience is let down"
"We had a lovely 4 days at the resort, which was not very full. Our wing was recently refurbished and was well equipped. The personnel has a great attention to detail and look to assure a comfortable stay at all times. Jair gave us a warm welcome and gave us the grand tour of the grounds (full of nooks and crannies, the design of the hotel is truly an I aspiration with spaces to relax, work, socialise and enjoy nature in its multiple impersonations at every turn). The personnel at the beach bar were very attentive and the most welcoming host, Rabab, made sure all our needs were met in our twice-daily visits. The cleaning personnel were very kind and amazingly quick to clean up and do a long forgotten service - a turn down service. Clearly the hotel and it's personnel have the client as their top priority and we are richer for the most wonderful experience we had. Thank you! Merci! Shoukran!"
"The Sofitel Agadir Thalassa Sea & Spa is currently undergoing a rejuvenation programme (which guests will only notice in passing). The first rooms, two of the three restaurants and the large garden with pool area have been perfectly transformed into an oasis of calm (the word oasis actually applies to the garden and the transition to the beach). The previously rather dark interior now shines bright and friendly (not necessarily Moroccan, but the beach/sea character has been emphasised). There are many cosy corners, especially outside, where you can unwind undisturbed. The cuisine is very good and offers a varied and tasty international cuisine. The staff are friendly, but could be more attentive at one point or another (e.g. at breakfast). Once the refurbishment is complete (including the main restaurant, entrance area and spa) this hotel will certainly have an even greater appeal. 

Due to its location away from the hustle and bustle of the package hotels at the end of the beach promenade in Agadir, it is certainly a very good choice for a stay here."
"Beautiful hotel with great views and location. I found the hotel teams were extremely pleasant and wanted to give great service - any room faults were very quickly fixed (safe required new battery for example) and found the room itself was spacious, well equipped and the bed was super comfortable, as well as a great shower! Breakfast was excellent with lots of choice and fresh made items and lunch in the beach restaurant/bar was excellent too. 2 members of the staff in the hotel stood out as being extra helpful and friendly and had nothing but smiles for all customers, so thank you to Rabab and Oumaima for taking very great care of us. I look forward to returning soon."
"Found was very helpful planning and helping us book everything everything was looked after he looked after everything😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍🧢😍😍✅✅✅✅🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥👌👌👌🦯👌👌👌👌👌👌👌🦯🔥👌👌🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥✅✅✅✅✅ ✅"
"My 3rd time at the hotel in 17 years. Beautiful beach and pool and restaurant areas. My room in the new wing was not completely built ready yet, for example the hairdryer was missing (always an inconvenient moment to find this out). Receptionists were playing the long game. One had to insist to get a ready room before or even after 15h00 check in. There is lots of dirt in the hidden corners and surroundings."
"I have the most amazing experience at the Sofitel , From the greeting when I was welcomed to the care by Mohamed for breakfast and the amazing service from Ismail at dinner in the beach front restaurant my experience was over the top! The poolside service was incredible and Bakta (sp) who  took care of my room I couldn’t have asked  for a better experience! Thank you to the entire team for making my stay and first experience with Morocco a beautiful one!"
"We loved this hotel. The interior design is curated to a very high standard. All of the beach and pool furniture is super comfortable and stunning. The restaurant and beach bar have a great selection of drinks and food. We felt so welcomed by the staff, especially Husain, Ahmed, and Rabab. They went above and beyond to ensure we were comfortable throughout our stay. We will definitely be back."
"Very nice place to chill, have a drink and eat lunch. Fatima zahrae Raban hostess were profesional and nice. We spend there a beautyfull chilling time during our hollydays in Agadir. We will back here next time for sure. Everything was perfect"
"Highly recommend Sofitel Agadir Thalassa Sea & Spa - the staff were so friendly and helpful, the breakfast buffet is wide-ranging and delicious and the staff were so attentive. The room was lovely - spacious, comfortable bed, cleaned everyday and bottles of water brought daily. The pool is huge and there are plenty of free sun beds at this time of year. To flag that the food at the restaurants (lunch / dinner / drinks as breakfast was included for us) is fairly expensive but once again the service was great. Really enjoyed our stay and would definitely return - thanks so much!"
"The hotel property is beautiful and the staff is really polite. However, the service is not 5 star always. 

The driver who picked me up did not look like a chauffeur from a 5star hotel and his merc van had lots of scraps and dent. He also did not turn on the air con and rolled down the windows (which I did not want as the wind and dust kept blowing in). When requested to close the windows and switch-on air con. He just told me to “wait”. He had two almost collisions, and drove a bit like a manic. I would have expected better from the hotel arranged pick-up. It was MAR 400 ride and definitely not worth it. 

The reception and concierge staff on arrival was extremely polite and helpful. I had requested an early check-in. I was told the room would be ready in 30 mins (no issues) but it took 2 hours (which was really frustrating). I decided to go get lunch. The hostess at the beach restaurant was really polite. However, the waiter never arrived to take the order.  Eventually I got access to my room and left. 

The room service and laundry staff is very polite but I am not sure that they fully understand what I am saying, and that can sometimes lead to quite funny situations like two orders for lunch. However, the staff is always quick to fix the issue. Polite and always follow-up. 

The property does not have any lifts and going up/down the stairs can be annoying at the end of a long day or in heels. 

AC is an issue and requires a lot of persistence to resolve."
"My husband and I have just spent one week at Sofitel. Agadir.  The hotel was beautiful with lovely gardens deserving a particular mention. Personnel went above and beyond to please.  Hichan, Rashid and Lahoucine deserve a special mention for their great  table service.  Fatima also kept our room so well cleaned.  However everyone was extremely helpful."
"Stayed with family start April. 
Lovely hotel with good facilities.
Had an issue with air con in suite but was sorted when moved room.
Staff did all they could to remedy.
Restaurant staff were great, Lahoucine looked after us each morning at breakfast and his language skills were excellent. 
Food is quite expensive but lots of choice and big portion size. 
Hotel situation is at end of promenade so need to walk to other restaurants but not so far.  It was a lovely walk in the evenings. 
Beautiful beach with private area for hotel guests."
"Staffs in the Sofitel, hotel, five star all are very good and very welcoming, all of them specially: Rabab , Muhamed , Muhamed ,mariam , Fatima Hussain,sabah, rashid,khadeja, Abida.
They were very helpful multi language speaking. And, always respectful, made us very welcome. It’s a place we will definitely come back.
Alan dilshad"
"Lovely hotel. Beautiful gardens and attentive staff. 
A lot of building work going on to update the hotel. 
We had one of the worst meals of our holiday in the hotel bar restaurant. Tempura prawns with their guts still in (nobody wants to eat prawn poo) and no potatoes (specified on the menu). When we asked the waiter who appeared to be in charge he tried  to lie and say the dish didn’t come with potatoes. He then disappeared behind the bar and left it to a junior member of staff to deal with. 

Shine, the young waiter, was delightful. He was friendly and efficient every day of our holiday and appeared truly embarrassed by our prawn fiasco. He was left to deal with our complaints while the more senior members of staff hid behind the scenes."
"We had a short but luxurious stay at this beautiful resort. Everything is really taken care of. I used my suite night upgrade here without any hesitance and got a beautiful spacious suite with terrace. I loved the sofitel-vibe through the resort. The breakfast was good too. However no 5 stars for me because of the following:
*AC was not working in the suite
*Toilet was leaking and the door could not be locked
*The biggest issue for me was an employee straight up walking into out room, without knocking or anything, to check the minibar. This felt quite unsafe for my and my wife….
Hopefully these points are incidental as the rest of the resort was beautiful."
"This hotel has fantastic facilities and grounds. The restaurant,  especially the Spanish served very good quality food. The tempura prawns were exceptional. The waiting staff were very knowledgeable.  The buffet, although quite pricey, served very good quality produce. There were no chips in sight.!  Using the spa was at additional cost, as I thought this was too much, we did not use. This should really be included for guests. Even if it only allows one complimentary visit per stay. This is not a cheap hotel. My room was a little tired, but very comfy and was cleaned every day.  This was a birthday trip, the hotel delivered a very nice cake to my room and sang happy birthday,  this was a very nice touch,"
"I had lunch at the beach restaurant, it was really delicious and with a really nice view. 
The steak was delicious!
It’s a nice atmosphere with music and set really aesthetically. 

Special thanks to: 
Fatima Zahrae, housine, khadija and ayoub!"
"As a returning guest, I was delighted to see the work in the garden finished and new pool - great!  Also the improvement to the beach area and restaurant.  I must mention the excellent team operating at the latter Reda, Naudine and Hocine who are a real bonus.

The internal lobby area still needs an upgrade   The restaurant that works so well for breakfast is very dull for dinner.

I am looking forward to seeing  the new garden area at the front on my return next year as it beats the Caribbean with the garden and beach."
"This was our third visit and good news they had finished the garden and added pool now superb.  Otherwise the hotel is a bit of a curate's egg!  Wonderful staff and particularly the hostess Fatima Zahrae who was exceedingly helpful.  The common parts of the hotel need updating and the restaurant for dinner is dreary.  Breakfast is top class other food variable although good local produce.

We will return as a great venue with the beach and hopefully it will continue to improve."
"The hotel is very comfortable, fantastic location in front of the ocean, the huge garden full of lavish succulent vegetation and comfortable chairs 
Staff is very helpful.Fatima zahrae  hôtesse d’accueil  and everybody has been very kind including the waiter  mohamed sahli  and the manger mohamed batlouka .
The only problem is that the lighting in the bedroom is very poor and it is impossible to see yourself in the mirror."
"Incredibly beautiful hotel on the sea. The food is wonderful, the setting is stunning and the staff are so friendly. A smile and chat every morning. Mohamed the manager is superb as is Mohamed who serves a delicious breakfast with great banter. It's our second time here and we will definitely be back."
"Had a fantastic stay at the hotel and two ovely meals at La Plage. The hostess Fatima Zahra was charming and welcoming. Made us feel very welcome. Beautiful views of the sea. Good ambience. Would definitely recommend 😊 We ordered the burger and croc moiseur. The burger was delicious, would highly recommend. Freshly squeezed orange juice to die for!"
"Amazing food, beautiful views and great  service from Fatima Zehra hostess in particular.
Lovely vibe and a great way to spend a chilled sun soaked afternoon.
We ordered the burger and chips and the orange juice were all tasty.
Would recommend!"
"Went with my girlfriend in January for a week holiday. The staff were outstanding, so polite and couldn't do enough for us.  From check-in to check-out, every interaction was marked by professionalism and genuine care. A special mention to Miriam at reception who upgraded us to a stunning room overlooking the sea and to the cleaner Laila who did such a spendid job. The food was incredible and the aesthetic of the hotel was beautiful. It smelt so good when walking around and it was so clean. Would definitely return. 10/10"
"Our stay at the Sofitel Agadir was very relaxed and beautiful. The garden is amazing and well-kept with a magnificent transition from park to sand dunes. The guard at the beach was extremely kind, as were the staff at the breakfast, in particular Rabab Darine, as well as the chamber maintenance, with Fatima and her team,  the reception desk, the fitness instructor, the entrance gate personnel and many many more. There was a true team spirit in the always friendly and kind services that made this stay in a great location unforgettable. We’d love to be back soon."
"The staff and service was absolutely amazing! We thank Hanan, Hasna, Amina, Qulham and everyone else who were always so friendly and made sure our needs were met. The room cleaning was always so quick and the view from the rooms were absolutely beautiful. The staff from the entrance, lobby all the way to to the dining room were always so kind and helpful. We are excited to hopefully come back again! Thank you to everyone "
"Excellent customer service,  especially Imane Guest Relations agent ,  was very helpful, kind, and made things right for us.
Hotel has very good breakfast. Private beach and bar are very nice as well.

酒店客服人员，Imane 很热心，帮我们调换到满意的房间，酒店早餐很好，私人沙滩和酒吧都很好。酒店设施需要提高。

"
"We had a truly wonderful experience at the Sofitel Thalassa Sea & Spa in Agadir. Everything from check in until check out was seamless. All the staff were very friendly and helpful. Oussama on the front desk was so welcoming, very warm and super professional. We really appreciated the good service he provided. He really took excellent care of us. Yacine on the front desk was also fantastic, in particular taking time and showing patience while answering my queries on the phone in advance of arrival. The beds were so nice to sleep in and the breakfast is of great quality with a big variety to choose from. Breakfast staff were also incredible, Mohamed Sahil greeted us with a warm smile and excellent coffee every morning and was very attentive. We'll definitely be back and send our big thanks to everyone for making our stay so lovely."
"I’m so glad to be staying at this Resort in Agadir, it is the best resort there is around Agadir. The hospitality that I have received here. Imane has been so kind and helpful with my stay here. I will be back as soon as possible

"We stay at the resort for 6 days which I think it was more than enough time to visit Agadir, the hotel was beautiful, the staff were really nice and helping specially Imane gr who help me organise my best friend birthday night at one of the hotel restaurants, also Hussain and Joseph were always there to help us with enquires or restaurants to visit. Rooms were really nice and clean, overall we loved our stay here, will definitely come back. "
"We tried almost 4 places for pool access in Agadir but the one in Sofitel is the best .
Very spacious pool , the access to the beach is easy.
The food amazing, the girls ibtesam et meriem in the reception  are friendly, thanks to ousama for the hospitality and the help . 

Ps: the waiters must smile ! They were all angry ! 
Anyways it was a such great experience."
"Lovely hotel & staff. Everyone is so accommodating and respectful. 
Rim has helped us a lot, she is very kind and professional and helped us throughout our stay. We were not happy with our view from the room however Rim managed to help us and is very good at her job. "
"I had a business meeting at the hotel so I chose the fabulous Sofitel beach restaurant. 

I ordered a melon salad to start with a mint salsa dressing and then Fish and Chips for main course. The melon was wonderfully refreshing and the fish and chips was outstanding. As good as at home. Well done the Sofitel.

 The pool and beach restaurant menu has improved dramatically and a must visit destination. Superb food and brilliant location. "
"I’m really happy with this treatment by all the employees this is hotel 🫶❤️
And special thanks to fatimzahra the hostess she’s very professional with the guests I wish for him a nice futur 🫶, thanks for all .
#univers restaurant plage ."

También me gusta el restaurante que esta en la playa se llama Restaurante la plage it’s so nice and relaxing."

"Recently spent the first part of our honeymoon here and we had a fantastic experience. The hotel is beautiful and the facilities including the restaurants, pool, spa etc. are of very high standard. But it was the people who made our experience special. From the ladies at reception and the concierge Houcine, who went above and beyond to make our stay outstanding and memorable, to all the pool butlers like Zakiria (to name just one), staff could not have been more friendly, helpful and kind. We really loved every minute of our stay and hope to be back soon. "
"Thank you for making our holiday memorable it was one of my favorite the staff were great they made it better I really appreciated the help of Latifa she is amazingly did her work as it should be ❤️❤️"
"Fab hotel ,amazing staff and customer service,specially girl at reception Latifa she it’s the best ,she makes our stay fantastic,big thank u so so much to her ,can’t wait be back This Hotel it’s Paradise no words need it 👌😘🤞"
"This is our 5th trip here in 9 years so I am somewhat biased. The hotel staff were warm and friendly especially Mohamed Sahli and Halima who went out of their way to make it a special break. The place is under repairs which whilst occasionally noisy didn’t detract from the beautiful scenery and surroundings. Will definitely be back and I look forward to seeing the upgraded rooms. 
Thank you all for a great stay "
"We are absolutely blown away by the exceptional experience from Mr Brahim Bouriqi and his fantastic team. We stayed at Sofitel for the 3rd time and Mr Brahim went above and beyond to create a world class experience. 
Our room was a dream with  beautiful views and excellent facilities nearby. At breakfast the care from the staff was 5 star and more. They listened to our needs and provided us the best table, the best care and the best service. 
By the pool we received fantastic service again from the amazing team. Proactive and really wonderful in checking in with us to ensure we have a fabulous day. 
Every little touch from the sunglasses cleaning to the little fruit shots in the morning makes the experience extremely memorable. 
In my work I lead talent management and identifying talent across a company can be challenging. You can see Sofitel Thalassa Agadir have invested in exceptional training and support to ensure the staff provide a world class and memorable experience. 
Mr Brahim is excellent at driving these behaviours - we will be back again soon and will be sure to recommend the hotel to all our friends and family. "
"Great 3 night stay .. second time in the hotel .. spent most of the time in the pool .. great service especially from amine + abdelkhalek and the barman amin .. i had my dog with me and it was all great they were friendly with her as well . Special mention also to amina the cleaning lady. Weather was great and the breakfast was nice and prompt . Value for money and still is the best hotel in agadir service wise. The rooms are still good but in need for a slight revamp to challenge the newer hotels in tghazout but  will definetley make another visit soon . 2 swimming pools to suit every mood and luckily for me got to meet a couple of interesting people. Till  next time"
"I visites restaurant la plage with ly Friends and it was Amazing , i highly recommand for couples and Friends . If you wanna spend some good Time with good music and good good then restaurant la plage is thé place to be"
"I visited the Restaurant atlantique at sofitel and i must say it's wonderful, the staff are very attentive and nice  the dj is great he made me dance hahahahha. Amazing view i highly reccommand for dates or friends date ."
"First of all I would like to thank Aïcha and Aziz for their warm welcome and the great service. 
The drinks are amazing , the view is splendid great taste of music the Dj is great . I highly recommend this place "
"We had a great time watching the sunset from the « restaurant la plage » very friendly staff and great service. I do recommend this place if you want to enjoy your time solo or with friends or family."
"This place is heaven on earth! Very relaxing vibe , good food and very nice service! I would definitely recommend it either for self dating or for any kinda visit. Loved every moment I spent there . You ll make good memories here . Thank me later 🙏"
"Amazing outdoors... pool.. private beach and terraces.. even if the hotel is on construction but the service is good even amazing especially at the arrival, reception staff and their manager are very welcoming and they make you feel like home... with a a very tasty welcome drink! I'll come back soon for sure"
"An excellent hotel located at the far end of the Croisette at Agadir beach
 Opposite end to the marina. Low level structure. Internal decor is stunning. Pool area is lovely. Bedrooms are a good size and comfortable tho are showing some signs of wear and tear. Food is excellent  in the restaurants. Helpful and efficient staff in all areas. Spa is lovely but top end pricing for treatments."
"A wonderful hotel, location and team. All dining experiences were exceptional - breakfast (Halima runs a very tight ship!) variety caters for every requirement and the restaurants (from the buffet to the fine dining) is superb, complemented by wonderful service and supporting team.

Special highlights are the pool and beach bar. The pool team work really quickly to get you what you need and it is all great quality. The Plage restaurant is a stunning location and again, the real there look after everything with precision and always with a warm smile.

The pool area is immaculate with many different areas to relax in and find the shade as well as sunbathe. Hidden snugs are also available for ultra afternoon snoozing / it really does give you endless choices. The private beach beds give a great view of the sea as a finishing touch.

All the staff are great and do everything to address any questions or preferences you may have. Leila from housekeeping is continually on hand to tidy your room, top up water and let you in if you lose your key! So many individual touches for us - she really did make the stay extra special and refused to say goodbye ‘only see you next time!’

For such a large hotel, the personal touches are never far away. A tip would be to book a room with the pool or sea view - facing the old Sofitel might not be for everyone.

We won’t hesitate to return - it really is fabulous. I would not name check all of the staff if I could!"
"Fantastic location on the beach in Agadir, away from the touristy areas yet near enough to walk or a short taxi. The property is expansive with nice open areas around the pools. Staff is very attentive and seems to always ready for questions or help. In particular the highlight of this stay was Mr Hucine, the concierge. I’ve visited over 50 countries and stayed at hundreds of properties, Mr. Hucine is easily top 3 if not number 1 in professionalism, knowledge and support. He was able to help with on property and off property requests. Restaurants, travel and activities were easily handled with the utmost kindness and genuine hospitality of the Moroccan people."
"Beautiful hotel.  Rooms, pool area and private beach all fantastic. The service was exceptional, nothing was too much trouble.  Special shout out to Zachariah and Yassin who waited on us around the pool area.   Really friendly and helpful and went above and beyond. We had the most amazing breakfasts around the pool, just superb "
"I went to Sofitel with my friends and we had dinner there at restaurant Palais de jardin and it was amazing , great food and great service specially Aïcha , I highly recommend for romantic date or Moroccan soirée 

"
"Les Palais du Jardin restaurant. We only came for my birthday celebrations and they did so much for me. Wonderful hotel restaurant and wonderful meal and customer service. The restaurants looks so beautiful and suave. Food is exceptional and well seasoned with a great amount of food on plate. Such a wonderful lovely time. Thank you so much everyone who was involved. I'm.so.grateful. "
"Read and Ibrahim were great waiters. They were so attentive and helped my friends birthday be a grey success with a beautiful cake and fruit platter. This was the best food I have had in Morocco since I have been here. Les palace de jardin was an amazing 5* restaurant"
"The first thing to say about this place is how great the staff is, they really made us feel so welcomed and made our five year old son feel very special. The stand out stars for us were: Aisha who really looked after us, the cleaning lady Leila who had a wonderful smile every morning  and the waiter Azdir in the seafood restaurant on the beach. The food is also very good, we ate at the seafood restaurant few times I highly recommend the grilled octopus. Now a few things to be aware of, the beach is nice but not the cleanest so we had to always keep an eye where we were stepping. Second thing to be aware of is the hotel is going through refurbishment so before you book make sure what stage they are at, as most days there was drilling that made it hard to relax. It wasn't all day but enough to disrupt your relaxation. "
"Very good IFtar , i really enjoyed the food is very varied and delicious , amazing buffet amazing service , the staff are very friendly and serving .            
i highly recommend  for friends and family "
"We stayed here for 11 nights. The resort is beautiful and very quiet. We were upgraded to a premium suite on arrival which was nice. There is construction happening on one side of the hotel. 

We had sublime service from Aicha and she always had a friendly smile for us. Any small issue we had Aicha had it immediately seen to. Our daughter loved Aicha and would have happily spent her holiday there following her around lol. She even gave our daughter a gift when we were leaving which was so sweet. 
Best Guest Manager of any hotel we've visited in many countries. 

Another shout-out to Halima - always smiling and super friendly and attentive to any requirements. The resort was busy which meant Halima was too but that didn't interfere with her amazing work ethic and professionalism. Lots of very needy guests lol!

We really enjoyed eating at La Plage restaurant and did for lunch most days and dinner on a few. We also went for a sunset drink most evenings which is sublime.
The staff working this restaurant were super friendly and attentive and always remembered what we ate and drank. Exceptional service from Azeddine and Noveddine in particular but all staff were great.

Shout-out to Mohammad in the Jardin restaurant who was always there and smiling and remembered what we ate and drank. Very nice to our daughter. 

Now a few suggestions for the hotel..
- keep the music on at the La Plage sometimes it was on but then suddenly it was turned off lol. It adds to the ambience and surroundings to have music on. Also be good to have music playing inside the restaurant too.
- if there are many group bookings e.g. Ramadan at the Jardin buffet please don't forget the guests who are staying at the hotel or at least mention to them that it's going to be a busy evening. We had to wait over an hour for a table one evening as it was so busy with outside groups. Not ideal with a child.
- the charge for a litre of water at the restaurants is excessive

We would definitely revisit for a long weekend!"
"We’ve just returned from a week staying at the Sofitel. We were in need of rest and relaxation and we could not have chosen a more perfect hotel.  The hotel itself is an oasis of calm and tranquillity. The grounds are beautifully designed and very well maintained. We spent most of the time lounging by one of the pools, under the shade of a canopy. We ate lunch and dinner mainly at the beach restaurant, a great menu and the food was beautifully presented and delicious. In my opinion staff can make or break a hotel experience and in the case of the Sofitel the staff absolutely made our holiday. Everyone was so friendly and helpful, but special mention has to go to l’hostesse Halima and to Mouhamed Sahli who were so kind and attentive that we were genuinely sad to have to say goodbye to them.  I really do recommend this hotel if you are visiting Agadir, we will definitely return."
"Food was so delicious, the stuff were so kind, I really love this place, highly recommended, Excellent hotel with lovely accommodations. The personnel is really helpful, nice, and efficient.
Perfect pool area; prompt, efficient service.
The institute for thalassotherapy was also a wonderful experience. Thank you to the entire crew, especially Asma, the PR officer, who did a great job taking care of us."
"I’m really glad from our stay in Sofitel hotel it was a dream vacation for us we enjoyed every moment in it and we love how they pay attention to the details so we will come back for sure 
Thank you Sofitel"
"Amazing hotel they welcomed us with tea and Moroccan sweets the staff were very friendly and helpful specially the guest relations  team . 
The food at palais de jardin sooo delicious 
The pool area is just amazing and peaceful also the private beach is 👍🏻 
I highly recommend "
"Absolutely fabulous! highly recommend and my new favourite place to stay in Agadir and especially customer relations . As well as easy to find.
One of the best hotels I have visited in my years of travels, by far the best in Morocco."
"Amazing stay @ this Hotel. Must mention Mohammed (Night Shift Manager) for his hospitality and tips during our stay, Halima @ Breakfast for her hospitality and great conversations , Samia who made sure our room was cleaned and in good order every morning always smiling, Abdul Kalek @ Breakfast for making sure we had all we needed during our stay.  

One minus point was the fact that anyone using the Indoor Pool, Jacuzzi or Steam Room would be charged 300 Dirhams for doing so which I found strange as other 5* properties around the globe offer this for free to all visitors. The reason given was that the hotel use sea salt in the indoor pool and jacuzzi which other hotels do not have. My point was that I’d this is the case have it mentioned on the website for this hotel to help when people decided to book a stay at this property. 

Apart from the above this hotel is for sure one of the best I have stayed at and will return for sure."
"From the moment I arrived at the Sofitel Thalassa Sea & Spa, I felt like a VIP. The check-in process was seamless, and the staff was always available to assist with anything I needed. The room was spacious and comfortable, and the views of the ocean were breathtaking.
If you're looking for a luxurious getaway, look no further than the Sofitel Thalassa Sea & Spa. The facilities are top-notch, from the pool to the restaurants to the spa. But what really made my stay special was the staff, who were incredibly attentive and made me feel like royalty."
"I loved being at the hotel, a lot of incredible experience but I want to highlight the professionalism and friendliness of Azeddine he was simply amazing with us and made our stay even more unforgettable."
"We’ve stayed at the Sofitel for 5 days and we have nothing but good things to say about the hotel. Their willingness to make you feel comfortable is second to none. We’ve had a couple of minor issues in our room and they didn’t hesitate to try and find a suitable solution for us. Special thanks to Yasser Lagmar who’s gone above and beyond to make us feel at home with the help of Mouna and Ibtissam.

The food in both the restaurants (a la carte and the buffet) is excellent and once again from the chefs to the waiters, everyone has been very attentive, welcoming and extremely respectful.

There’s works taking place in a small area of the hotel, but it’s not annoying at all. It’s all part of enhancing the features of an already lovely place that needs maintenance and it’s likely aiming to be ready for summer.

One last bit from us to anyone reading this review:
1. Don’t complaint after you’ve left the hotel and write a horrible review. Provide honest feedback and raise any concerns whilst you are staying at the hotel. 100/1 they will do everything in their power to right their wrongs and help you out 
2. Remember there is a language barrier ( French is obviously the preferred language) so allow those who do not speak English/Spanish time and be kind. They will try or find someone else who does and you will be able to request whatever you like. Patience and kindness are well received here in Morocco"
"We stayed for two weeks at this wonderful hotel with its own private beach overlooking the ocean! Our room had a wonderful sea view and a great chambermaid called Leela who looked after all our needs.
The breakfast and dinner buffets were excellent and we were spoiled for choice because there was so much variety!
The concierge Hussein was amazing helping us with excursions and trips to restaurants.
We had a relaxing and wonderful holiday and will be back next year."
"Had an amazing time with my best friend at this hotel celebrating my 40th birthday! The hotel is very modern and clean, amazing customer service, there was a heated pool and normal pool to choose from which was helpful to say we visited in January and the hotel was on its own private beach.
Every visit we made in agadir was 10 minutes from the hotel and the taxis only cost £2 at the most! 
Ghizlaine and Asmaa We’re absolutely amazing at the hotel organising a late check out for us as we had an evening flight. The concierge Hussain was also an amazing help giving us all the useful tips on where to visit. 
I can’t wait to come back again!! 
Thankyou Sofitel for helping me build the best memories for my 40th!!"
"We stayed - 16 January- 26th January - Room 156
During our 10 nights stay, we received on every occasion - friendly smiles & service from all Hotel staff. - who would pass the time of day.
The hotel offers great service, and is well appointed. Our room was side sea facing, and house-keeping did an excellent job, in cleaning, replacing towels and toiletries- when necessary. A good supply of daily bottled water. Aircom efficient- and noiseless. Housekeeping staff also very friendly & helpful.
Breakfast good selection of hot food cooked to order, as well as fresh bread pastries, local breakfast dishes, fresh fruit and what you would expect from a 5 star hotel. Staff were well organised & again friendly.
Hotel has beautiful outside grounds, swimming pools and own Private Beach area.
We would like in particular to mention 
Houcine - Hotel Concierge- who gave us excellent information on the local area- and advice on where to go and dine. He also booked several restaurants for us and arranged with the restaurants a pick-up shuttle service where they sent us transport. He again was always very friendly yet professional.
Also special mention to
Miss Halimal (El Moutaouakil) - Breakfast Guest Host- always a smile to greet us at Breakfast and everyday took the opportunity to speak with us and again check back to make sure everything was good and we were enjoying ourselves.
Miss Khadija (Mtabti) - again working in the breakfast area- always remembering each day our order, and again taking time to speak with us.
These staff made our holiday extra special and big thanks for all their help and friendship.
We would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to others/friends & family and would book this hotel again should we ever be back in Agadir.
Many thanks - Keith & Partner
Hotel is at the end of the paved sea front promenade- a good walk from the Town centre- but an enjoyable walk either on the foot path or along the beautiful beach. Hotel has good security- identity being checked especially when coming back late in the evening."
"First visit to Moroco, Agad and very happy to stay in this this Hotel. The room is very clean, very very friendly staff, nice and clean beach, and close to everything. Definitely will rebook in Sofitel.  Omar housekeeping for nightshift was very friendly and very helpful and all the staff."
"This is my first vacation in Moroco-Agadir, I have stayed in Sofitel hotel in room 247, I have really spent great services, room clean, service inside is superb, people who are working here are super nice and friendly, food is so delicious as well as all other activities. In fact we were so lucky to have Omar in night shift who was looking after us with a nice smile all the time. We really appreciate all efforts that has been done to us. We are looking forward to scheduling our next trip to agadir."
"We have spent a fabulous week in the Sofitel Thalassa Sea, the hotel was recommended by friends and so we thought we’d give it a try. What a place!!! It is in a great setting by the beach and the property is quite new and very well kept. The staffs attitude to customer service elevates this place to a whole new level. Whilst we were here we celebrated our anniversary I mentioned this to Ghizlane the customer experience manager and she and her team went to an extreme I’ve not seen. They decorated our room, helped me create a special memory for my wife, got a customised cake put us in a suite all without having to ask. We had a late flight and Ghizlane came to enquire about our stay when we mentioned we were leaving in the evening she just offered for us to stay in the room until our departure, someone give this lady a medal please!! The staff at breakfast led by Mohammed were first rate attentive but not overly so always a smile on their faces. I would rate the hotel 9 and the staff 11 out of 10 averaging a 10! Will definitely come back. My only comment would be that the hotel should offer a package with use of the spa facilities included it’s not expensive per time, but it’s better to add these things in so you don’t have to think about it in my opinion.

We can’t wait to come back in the near future."
"Had a nice stay in this beautiful hooooootel , the staff was amazing especially miss ibtissam she was nice to talk tooo !! The room was nice with a veeeery nice view 
I would love to come again 
Thank youuuu for your service"
"if you're looking for the best hotel in Agadir, make sure you chose this place. their service was impeccable, breakfast delicious and dinner sumptions. 
the hotel is located right on the beach with plenty of sun loungers.

the staff are very helpful,  special mention to Muhammed Sahli and Hussain from concierge who went above and beyond and were extremely helpful."
"Manchester City fc under 21’s training visit to Agadir and staying at Sofitel Thalassa.  A place of excellence! The team team stayed for five days including a match against Agadir’s Hassania fc. (Lost 2-0). 
The stay at the Sofitel was fabulous in every way. The hotel could not have done anymore than they did in handling a top sporting team on this visit. The rooms, dining, concierge services, gymnasium, spa, housekeeping all first class. 
Each day fabulous selections for breakfast lunch and dinner, whilst working closely with the team’s nutritionist. Congratulations to Chef and his team. 
The hotel and its fabulous management team led by Jihane at Food & Beverage, chef Youssef, abdellatif, head of Reception, Soumia, Sales Manager, all could not have done more to make the visit a great success. 
Thank you Sofitel Thalassa."
"The hotel is probably the best one in Agadir.  There is not much in Agadir but this hotel is lovely if you want relaxation and to be by the sea.  There is a lovely beach bar/restaaurant and plenty of sunbed options around the pool or on the beach.  You don't get hassled on the beach.  We did not go in the spa but had a look at it.  There is an extra charge but is worth it if you want to chill and you have the time to use it. We spent 3 nights here and had 2 connecting rooms.  The lighting in the room s a bit dim but otherwise it is comfortable and I would recommend this hotel. We are a family of 2 adults and 2 children age 13 and age 15.  It is definitely worth paying a bit more for the comfort and security of the hotel, it looked much nicer than the others we saw.  The only criticism is the service which is dreadful.  It really lets down the Sofitel brand.  At breakfast for example we had to ask 5 times for a coffee and when it is finally brought, there's no milk or spoon and we had to then ask multiple times and multiple staff for the milk and a spoon.  I could give many examples, this is just one.  It is such a shame as they have lots of staff but they don't seem to know what to do, I think they just need training.  Another quick example is at lunch, we had to wait an hour for a linguine.  There were only 2 other tables with guests and 8 waiting staff and we asked for water and they finally bought a bottle but no glasses, which took another 15 minutes to arrive.  We had experience like this every time we ordered anything.  The staff are otherwise friendly and polite."
"A beautiful hotel located on the magical beach of Agadir.  I got room number 163 ,           a huge suite with sitting areas overlooking an amazing view.  A large bathroom and a Nespresso coffee machine.  Excellent breakfast with good food and Moroccan delicacies that are made on the spot.  
We had lunch at a restaurant on the beach, delicious and fresh food. 
I had a hammam treatment which was excellent.
  Great prices for all the aforementioned.  
And above all, an amazing team that helps with everything and smiles all the time.  Great stay"
"Our stay at Agadir Sofitel was an amazing experience from start to finish. The hotel was clean and well maintained and there were plenty of amenities to use. However, the main reason for our stay being so special was due to the work of Ibtissam and Ghizlaine from the guest relations team who made sure that I was able to propose to my fiancée in a perfect setting, on the beach. They provided us with unrivalled customers service and exceed all of our expectations.

Myself and my fiancée will absolutely be returning to Sofitel Agadir and hopeful we can see these familiar faces who made sure that were had an experience of a lifetime during our stay."
"My stay was great and I particulary enjoyed the Moroccan restaurant. 
Food is amazing, all plates were delicious, service is excellent - Thank you Redouane - and the whole atmosphere is magical. 
Highly recommend it !

"
"On our arrival we were warmly welcomed by the Sofitel Team. Everyone there was extremely friendly . 

Special THAN YOU to Ibtissam (hope I spelled your name correctly) who helped me organise a surprise birthday dinner to my partner. Me and her were organising everything over the email prior to our arrival. It came up perfect. My partner did not expect a thing. Thank you once again. Your service was more than 5*. 

All the stuff in the hotel seemed very caring, they were helpful with everything, even the smallest query you can imagine (there was no hairdryer in our room - after me mentioning it the hairdryer was delivered to our room in less than 5mins)

The food was delicious. The breakfast buffet was full of options that even if you stayed there for 2weeks you would not be able to try it all. The restaurant by the beach with an amazing menu and extraordinary views.

The rooms look well kept and fully equipped. Well done SOFITEL well done !!! 

We really enjoyed out stay at The Sofitel. 
Will definitely be back in the nearest future.

See you soon guys"
"It was a great experience , the service was great , the food was excellent i enjoyed my time there . I liked the view , people working there are very nice and serving specially aicha from the guest relation and nouaddine from Restaurant la plage"
"Came here after attending a conference in the city. The whole vibe if the hotel is very relaxing, clean, and well maintained. The staff is very helpful and the food was delicious. If you can, try their cheesecake desert."
"I stayed me and my husband  in one of the better rooms available and it was really good with amazing view, Lovely garden and swimming pools. Good location. Short walk from our room to beach, thank you for all the staff specially Amine bouaaycha in the pool for his professional service , kindness and attention, mr lahsen and the lady in the FO for their help in the moment of checking, thank you for this magnificent stay.
TO NOTICE "" the pastta that we have ordered from IN ROOM DINNING was not as we expected normally should be cooked with ( magret de canard fumé) instead of turkey ham . 

"
"The place was very nice, i enjoy it a lot! I came with my friends and we had a great time especially with the girl named AICHA if I'm not mistaking! She was very nice to us and give us a good vibes while showing the place. I ll came in September again and again.. Thank you Sofitel !"
"If u want to watch a goood sunshine with a cold drink between ur hands and a good talk with ur friends i would highly recommend sofitel as a good place to go to with ur friends and the customer service is on point"
"I had a great time with the family, everything was fine and wonderful, when it comes to service Nour Eddine handles it so great, the place and music are also so wonderful, me and my family were so glad to have thèse moments."
"Ayoub Boulidame is areally great man , treating people nicely and in a friendly way , he’s so cool. Also for the service, it was so nice Ibrahim Zoihyi and Salma did a really great job all the times I came, they were so helpful, great thanks for them."
"This is the best place to stay in Agadir by far!it is the only luxury 5 star hotel that is  actually  on the beach so no travel required. The staff are amazing, great  tasteful decor, the view on entrance is idyllic! Nice choice of pools -warm and cold and never too busy. The best breakfast and evening buffet, the best and exceptional spa( thanks Hanen and Samira and all the front desk) a nice choice of restaurants and large screen in club room too. Most of your time is spent outside and the grounds and furniture are like paradise. The staff give excellent service and always with a smile. It is great value for money and they have a great loyalty programme too!

"We celebrated my birthday in the Moroccan restaurant at the Sofitel after taking the apero at the beach and we had a great service and an amazing birthday cake with everyone singing and clapping. A big thanks to Farid and Zahira who made this happen."
"We are currently on our 6th night staying at Sofitel Thalassa - which is a beautiful hotel with staff that provide an exceptional level service.

We tend to stay at 5 star hotels when travelling so we have a fair few hotels we can compare this to.

What really sets this hotel apart is the staffs attention to detail and genuine care. This is a large resort however they staff seem to have seamless communication between individuals and quickly get to know who you are and what you like. After all, going 5 star should mean a personalised experience to your needs and Sofitel Thalassa does this perfectly.

There's so much to say about this hotel, but I will mention a few of the highlights that have made this an extra special experience.

We came here to celebrate my wife's birthday and before arriving I had informed the hotel of the reason for our stay.

We booked a room with side sea facing view - the room was lovely and we were given a room that faced the quieter side of the beach - which meant the balcony could be used with out worrying about people looking in etc. On our first day we were provided with a large bowl of fruit and plenty of complimentary water - which continued throughout our stay.

During our stay the pool boys and all the staff at te restaurants are always so hospitable and caring. I don't remember all their names however many of the staff working around the pool side are always asking us if we need any drinks or food and constantly making sure all the guests are enjoying their selves. The mint tea that they make is the best mint tea I have ever tasted along with the mojitos!

The pastry selection at breakfast is endless and the fresh orange juice is again the best I've ever had!

On my wife's birthday the Guest Relation Manager (Ghizlane El Kabous) organised a private outdoor breakfast experience for my wife which was beautiful and something we will never forget! Thank you very much! Hôtesset Jouhaina and Petite Khadija Lemtabti made the experience even more wonderful with their service and hospitality. This was then followed by a cake made by Chef Abdolah which was absolutely delicious!

We had originally booked for 5 nights but because we were enjoying ourselves so much we wanted to extend our stay by a few nights - Khadija on front desk made this happen even though they were fully booked! 

If your looking for a place to unwind which is close to the beach then this is where you need to stay.

I'm looking forward to my last 2 days here and if I ever come back to Agadir I will definitely be staying here again!"
"A great service and delicious Moroccan original cuisine. A great thank you to the whole team and especially Redouan for his professionalism. An experience that will be always remembered and I will definitely recommend to my friends and family. I will sure come back again."
"by experience, it was a nice place to relax, and take one moment for rest,specifically the  restaurant are nice ,the food was tasty and  delicious ,the service was grateful, manage by Mr Redouan who has a  personnality kindful ,i recomanded this place."
"I really enjoyed staying there beautiful view  and good service , the food was great and the cocktails too , i remember aicha and ibtissam from guest relation they were very good to me and helped me when i was in need"
"My experience at palais du jardin , a restaurant at Sofitel Thalassa Agadir was absolutely delightful thanks to the excellent service administered by Mr. Redouan . The food was delectable , exquisite and representative of the heavenly Moroccan flavors ,  for instance the Tanjia that was showcased gracefully  . I would highly recommend it for anyone wanting a mystical time ."
"my vacation at sofitel thalassa agadir is over but my longing to return is not over.
wonderful smiling and helpul staff.
varied breakfast and many vhoices.
although the hotel was full,our order was delivered to us without delay, mr redouan was with us throughout our holiday, smiling, gentle and elegant 
thank you so much 
I will return soon"
"Done our first 3 days of 7.  Been lovely.  Facilities good and staff really positive.  For a country with covid restrictions it feels safe and careful.  Hotel a bit dated but clean with a passionate team, who cannot do enough for you.  Hoping the rest is as good.  Leila our room keeper is wonderful."
"We were upgraded to a 2 bedroom suite , check in was prompt and staff friendly. Rooms clean with contemporary decor . Room service slow and menu limited . All 3 restaurants including the pool area , menus are in French ! No English menus available ! So its google translate or brush up your French before booking . There were a few areas that the hotel could improve on which the Guest Relationship Manger - Ghizlaine El Kabous and the F&B manager made sure that those areas were improved to give my family the luxury service of an ACCOR hotel . A very special thank you to Omar house keeping manager and Latifa who made our suite beautiful everyday with fresh fruit and flowers . We will never forget your smile and kindness during our stay . Overall the hotel resort is a relaxing safe  place to be with many seating areas to select from . Brilliant for families , couples or even those that travel alone ."
"Fab break - two stints either side of essaouira and what a perfect setting to relax with a 3 year old splashing about in the pool! Special thanks to Oumaima pampering us over breakfast! Great food, perfect weather and great service"
"We spent a lovely day at the pool. The food was good. The service was perfect thanks to sofiane and ayoub. They were very professional and caring about the little details. I appreciate the hospitality and the service."
"I made great memories with my friends, we had joyful moments in our stay. We had great times at the bar, the food also was delecious and well served, also the people at the hotel were so nice and friendly."
"I had a great weekend on Agadir at Sofitel Thalassa sea and spa, the people there are so nice and loving, a good whether with a great moment at the pool with my family was a really nice experience to have."
"We had a great time me and my small family at sofitel, the kids loved the rooms, we spent a wonderful moment together at the pool, I personally enjoyed the view at the restaurant at night while listening to the music."
"The hotel was absolutely amazing, thee most beautiful hotel i have ever stayed at

Staff in this hotel they are incredible, customer service all the way to even the smallest of things are done for guests to enjoy every moment of their stay 

The birthday experience i had here was honestly beautiful 
The room presented by the manager Omar was stunning beautiful balloons & roses all over the room and a view that would knock your socks off 

Food 10/10 
Service 10/10 
Everything was 10/10 

And i would 100% recommended this hotel as i will for sure be back very very soon"
"Enjoyed a mother and daughter 5 night stay at the Sofitel Agadir Thalassa Sea & Spa at the end of May. I must commend the hotel for the excellent standard of service we received. From the general manager, to front desk, concierge, our room cleaner Alina and in the restaurants, we received a warm and friendly welcome. Mr Brahmin - manager of food and beverage went above and beyond with service and hospitality to ensure my specific dietary requirements were met in the restaurants. Our Presteige Suite was spacious and offered a prime view of the resort as a whole.  I would wholeheartedly recommend a stay here should you visit Agadir. Thank you Sofitel team! "
"Excellent hotel, perfect breakfast and all servis - team, specially Mohamed Sahli. He was really good waiter. He was very nice with us every morning and evening. Special thaks for good servis and excellent wine. Thank you, Mohamed!

See you soon, hotel Sofitel!"
"The hotel is very nice with superb swimming pools and nice private beach. Rooms are impeccable, comfortable and very clean. Breakfast buffet good with good choice and helpful staff. The beach restaurant is very nice but service and menu choice are not at the top. The fine-dining restaurant was not at all at the expected level. Service will probably improve as the attitude is good but noticeable lack of training and experience."
"I spent a week at the Sofitel Thalassa Sea and Spa and I am completely satisfied with my experience.
The hotel is in a wonderful location, at the end of the Agadir promenade and directly on the beach.
The pool area is very well laid out and has plenty of space.
The rooms are very large and functional.
The real highlight of the hotel is the wellness centre, wonderfully managed by the manager, Mrs Najia Bachir.
During my week's stay I purchased a 6-day, 24-treatment wellness package.
The skilful hands of Hanane, Nada and Samira made my stay unforgettable and restored my energy and positivity.
A holiday in Agadir is not complete without at least one day of treatments at the Thalasso centre"
"Fantastic experience at the Sofitel! Stayed there for a week for a mother- daughter trip and we were extremely impressed by the hotel itself (wonderful amenities may it be the incredible spa, the huge fitness, the beautiful restaurant and bars, our gorgeous room) and by the staff who really welcomed us and looked after us beautifully the entire trip. 
Thank you to the great Brahim, Simon, Izadine and Khadija at the restaurant who all made  sure we had the best table and everything we needed at every meal, but also to our fantastic room teams with Mouna and her governess, to Ghislaine at the reception, and to the pool and spa teams who really provided us with the best care and service."
"So far, I think SOFITEL AGADIR has one of the most delicious and exceptional ""ftour"" I've ever eaten. i must say, your food is outstanding and great menu choices. same thing with the environment, the place was quiet and the lighting was perfect. you can even enjoy watching the ocean and sunset . Not to forget
how great was the service and how kind and friendly the staff was, they were willing to attend any request,  so  i would love to thank them especially
 miss ""jouhaina"" who was so adorable and who really fulfilled our requests perfectly. Can't wait to come again ."
"Beautiful hotel. Stylish and elegant. The pool area and outside restaurant were FAB. Food in main restaurant was a little below expectations for a 5 star hotel. Many staff appeared to be new Into the role possibly  as a result of a reopening after covid closure ? French and Arabic speaking  hotel - English not always understood. Bedrooms spacious and  very comfortable. Great showers."
"The hotel was so very relaxing with a pool deck area on the beach edge. The staff in both indoor  restaurants were also very friendly especially  Katia, speaking English, Italian, French, Arabic and of course Berber. The buffet was a 5☆☆☆☆☆  presentation too.   I am not so sure about the cocktails as the rum in my Pino Colada was a bit tasteless. Definitly a hotel i will return to."
"I rate this hotel ‘very good’ technically I’d give it 3.5 stars and rate it as ‘good’  but that’s not an option. 

What I’d rate 5 starts is the pool areas, they’re immaculate and and the whole exterior is of a high standard, very impressive. The outside restaurant is also beautiful, but the service was not very good, very slow, left waiting for too long. 

The room (we were 264) I’d rate a 3. Firstly the bed is NOT comfortable, they place a duvet under the bottom sheet which is just odd and makes sleeping awkward. Also, we had two power cuts and also one overflowing shower basin. Look, these things happen but nobody apologised. Towards the end of our 7 day stay, the air con gave off an unpleasant smell. Like damp. They also didn’t restock tea bags until the final day and there is no milk that is suitable for a tea, just a coffee cream which I had to ask for 3 times.. I’d say the room was acceptable, if not slightly dated and indeed of a proper refresh.  The view from the room was good.  We were in a luxury room, but it wasn’t luxurious at all, pretty basic.  Mini bar not stocked with anything. 

The food. Breakfast was mainly nice, as was lunch, although dinner became boring very quickly, some nights the meats were nice, others they were dry (this was in the market place) - their A La carte, was average at best, they had the same menu for a week, so we only went once, however the decor in there is nice.  My wife ordered pasta with brisket, and it was like it was out of a packet. 

Service: this is a hard one to rate, but overall, it was quite poor, occasionally it was good, but never 5 star. Inconsistent is a good way to describe it, often left waiting and wanting. I put this down to new staff after lockdown, but still, it should have been better. Service was mainly disappointing.  Pool service was very slow and the quality of cocktails was poor. 

Language. Please note if you only speak English you may struggle at times as this is a French speaking hotel, some staff have average English some not at all.

Despite my average review and disappointments, I would still return to this hotel as the pool area and grounds are so nice, I’d just go again with a lower expectation on service. 

My final words are: beautiful hotel, dated in places, service is what really lets the hotel down. It just is not 5 star at all."
"Overall a satisfactory stay. Stayed in the luxury side ocean view room. The balcony overlooking the hills and ocean offered amazing views. The private beach is pretty decent. La Plage restaurant offers stunning views and music. 

Breakfast can be improved considerably and would be nice if they had traditional Morocco breakfast items too."
"What a brilliant holiday! I really can’t not fault our stay here. The room was clean and cosy. The staff where friendly and the general vibe was just relaxing. 
Met a fair few people who actually travel to Morocco every year and stay in this hotel for months at a time so that just says it all"
"First time in Agadir for a loooong time. 
Everyone is lovely. No exception. Super clean hotel. 
Really enjoyed my vacations with my friends. 
Decent rooms considering the price. 

Thank you to all the staff 

Ilan C. ;)"

"Extremely beautiful location, by the beautiful Agadir bay. Very nice resort with grey and black as main colors and luxury and wellness being the overall theme. The rooms are pretty nice, quite spacious and have views on the common  areas such as the pools and the beach, but also the wooden bar by the beach. The layout is spectacular. Needless to say, the food was fresh and delicious. The service was quite fast and the staff were always smiling and ready to help.

The food is very delicious and service is outstanding. 
Wifi is accessible everywhere throughout the property. Overall we find our experience very pleasant and we're looking forward to come back."

Room service was very reliable and food was varied and tasty, especially cocktails around the pool or in the main bar. Both the pool and beach area had plenty of room. I opted for the pool since it was heated and very calm. 
Finally, my room was wonderful, I had a relaxing view on the ocean on the second floor, sunsets were so splendid to watch from the comfort of my terrace. 
I would like to thank everyone for their efforts and help, a special thank you note goes to the wonderful front desk receptionists especially Meryem and Mounir and Sana. 
Asma in PR made sure my stay went as good as I had wished. Congratulations for all of you."
"I have stayed here multiple times and will continue to stay here. 

I love the layout of the property not too big but has all the amenities you would expect. The pool area is well maintained. 

The rooms were able to keep cool in the Moroccan heat. They are laid out oddly though. I’ve never seen the shower directly behind the bed. 

The front desk staff really shines in giving recommendations and helping share knowledge of the local area. They went above and beyond for us and I can tell they do the same for others. 

I looks forward to my next stay in the area."

"Well what can I say after returning to the Sofitel Thalassa Agadir for the first time in eighteen months, to find the hotel having many changes and upgrades.

 The new heated swimming pool with super exclusive surrounds, the refitting of the old one, the amazing new newly planted gardens and walkways and the forthcoming new beach club and restaurant all are super upgrades. The hotel is undergoing major refurbishment and the standard is excellent. Most of all, the welcoming staff and service was a pleasure to experience and I enjoyed the lovely breakfasts. 

It was food to be back. Stay was too short, three days not enough."

"I want to share my honest review regarding my experience in Sofitel Thalassa. Very nice hotel by the beach side. Quite modern and extremely well decorated. It is honestly the closest thing to an art gallery. 
Other than the decor, the hotel has plenty of facilities such as the Thalasso institute and the So Fit gym. 
Lastly, the buffet restaurant is very good and the staff is very accomodating. Special shout-out to Fatima, Soukaina and Khadija at the main bar. Atif at the restaurant and Asma in PR service. "
"We spent four days in Sofitel Thalassa Sea and Spa. The service was perfect! They were so kind and really made us feel spend an unforgettable holiday during the Covid19 situation. I want to give special thanks to the staff at the reception who were there to fulfill all our wishes and to the amazing housekeeper Omar who was extremely kind and nice. We forgot some clothes at our room, but he took care of it and gave us back. The breakfast is quite delicious and fresh, also room service made us gain kilograms because it was so tasty that we did not want to eat anywhere else 🤣 Rooms were really clean and very well maintained (knowing that the hotel was closed during months Bcz of the actual situation). 
I really highly recommend the hotel, mostly because of the kind staff, tasty food and nice beach and swimming pool"

The food quality is delicious...The spa practicians are extremely gifted. Highly recommend massages ans body scrubs. I would only add that I wish the room were more modern and cleaner.

Ghizlane from guest relations was constantly checking on us to make sure our stay experience is a good one.
I recommend this property"
"We had a luxury room at this hotel.  The layout was quite different which made the room quite special.  The room had everything we wanted including cofee and tea making.  Bed was comfortable and there was a large balcony.  Our room 176 overlooked the sea.  It has its own beach area which is at the far end of the beach and is quiet.  The hotel's public rooms are modern and large and exceptional.  The bar restaurant served excellent food we found the local beer and wine excellent for out taste.  The servive we received was exceptional given the circumstances that they were working in many had lost their jobs due to the virus but they all remained cheerful.  Cannot praise this hotel highly enough and is sited in an ideal location with an esplanade to walk down the whole length of the crescent shaped bay. Definitely the best hotel that we could see in Agadir."
"Hotel is situated at the very end of the crescent beach in a quiet area but far from attractions, restaurants and shops.
Architecture inside and outside very beautifull.
Staff at reception, breakfast-room and pool offer excellent service.
Servicing of rooms is somewhat slow.
Diner in Moroccon speciality restaurant was not exciting."
"Once again we were not disappointed with the comforts of this 5 star hotel. Can't speak highly enough about some of the staff especially Houcine who couldn't do enough for us.  We had a pleasant deluxe double with sea and panoramic views of the entire Agadir resort. Choice at breakfast was endless and so easy to put on those extra pounds. In all a very enjoyable stay."
"Its a wonderful place , i likeee it so muuch its soo cool and a good service from Salma and Ghizlaan   i like also the bar and view  its very calm and romantic and of course the best singer ever Hind she have a beautiful voice ❤️❤️"
"We enjoyed our stay at this resort, a perfect winter sun escape! Very friendly staff!  The breakfast buffet was excellent with live cooking and lots of fresh juices/smoothies and very tasteful pastries! Evening buffet is good, however is getting a bit dull after a couple of days and it can get crowded. The Moroccan restaurant serves very tasteful moroccan cuisine and has a more elegant setting. Thalassa spa (hamman and water jets) is highly recommendable! The heated swimming pool is large but needs refreshing. One swimming pool was under construction. The infrastructure needs higher maintenance to remain at 5star level. "
"My husband and I visited this hotel at the beginning of February and it was our first visit.
We shall definitely be coming back next year but this time for longer. 

Firstly the hotel is immaculate and on first impressions it's stunning. 
I love architecture and I'm an interior designer and I adored all the furnishings and statues that are dotted around. 

We were treated so well that every person said hello and smiled. They are so professional and give such wonderful service. 
Our beautiful room was on the ground floor and a fantastic view of the hills with the writing on in lights. 

We had a turn back service, where slippers and  treats were left out. 

The food was exquisite and when I first heard it was a buffet I wasn't thrilled, but, there was every conseivable hoice of food. For vegetarians and vegans. 

Breakfast was devine and every day our wonderful Mohamed from the Market served me with fresh orange juice. He even got to know where we liked to sit and set everything up for us. 

On our last day we were very kindly given a spare room to get changed as our flight was late. 
The spa is also available for changing too and the ladies are wonderful. 
The little shop has the odd things you might of forgotten, like I did, sun cream,. 

The pool and beach is fabulous and the snacks and drinks to your sun lounger is fast and efficient.
The guys work really hard and nothing was a problem. 
We got to meet the hawk who scares the birds and the beautiful So, the hotel kitty. He welcomed us every morning sitting on the sofas. 

All in all a fantastic  wonderful, amazing time was had. 
We'd like to thank the following people for their outstanding service and care.
Rachid
Mohamed
Lhcen
Imad
Atif
Of the market restaurant
Ghislaine guest relations manager, this lady is so wonderful and we thank her very much. 
See you next February."
"I recommend it, it’s one of the best places in agadir it’s really nice to be there to watch the sun set, the personnel are so helpful, I want to thank Mounir for his smile it’s a lovely gay, thank you everybody for everything, I’ll be back"
"I stayed in this hotel with my best friend as we were travelling for rest, fun enjoying and everything was prepared well and organized  too. People are amazing, and service was perfect. Highly recommended"
"Hotel was modern clean and a pleasure to stay in.  Rooms were to a great standard and cleaned extremely well. We didn’t have dinner here but breakfast buffet and lunch around the pool was to a really high standard there was something for everyone and plenty of variety.  Room service food wasn’t good quality however but it was quick and hot.

We didn’t go to the spa as we knew it was chargeable so cannot comment - I understand the charge but I do think this should be free at least once during your stay for hotel guests. 

Ghizlaine made it an unforgettable stay for us and really went above and beyond to make sure we were happy and comfortable.  Great customer service prior to arrival also which put me at ease when planning our trip. Massive thank you to her and her team.

Would highly recommend this hotel & I look forward to returning soon. "
"Hello,
I was in sofitel thalasa
Its was really cool and beautiful view 
Id like to thnks all the staff for their smiles and also for their service
Many thanks to anas and hind the musiciens for the happy time and also i want to say thanks to mounir for his charm and good service"
"Was lucky enough to get to know Hind and Anas, respectivley the lead singer and the musician, both amazing and friendly people. Staff was friendly and welcoming, great overall vibes, defintely would recommend."
"This was our 5th trip to Agadir. We always go in the month of January as the weather is so perfect, We have previously stayed in the Riu Tika Dunas and the Sofitel Royal Bay. This year we wanted to stay at the newer Thalassa Hotel and Spa.

The actual hotel is very modern, beautiful and kept very clean. We found the pool area to be that more luxurious compared to it's sister hotel the Royal Bay which is need of refurbishment, We stayed in a junior suite which was fantastic, The room was big, comfortable and had a large bathroom (huge bath and shower). Nice bar area to drink and relax in the evenings accompanied by some live music.

Food in general was excellent although some more variation at dinner would be nice. Breakfast was good and the head chef is always coming up with nice little additions to the buffet (freshly squeezed juices and healthy 'salad' pots etc).

Highlight for me is the pool area and staff. Mustapha and the team are always on hand to get drinks, move beds and assist, with ordering food and drinks Yaniss in particular made our stay extra special with his attentiveness. Makes a big difference! Somedays they would bring round fresh juices for people to drink which is a nice touch. Another bonus is the swimming pool temperature is actually bare-able unlike the Royal Bay - in which you cannot swim unless you want a case of frost bite!

They're actually building another outdoor pool at the Thalassa which will be even warmer so look forward to that.

The only gripes we had was not being able to use the indoor pool and steam room facilities without paying a 200 MAD fee (per day) which I think is unreasonable when staying in a 5* spa hotel. We didn't use the spa at all as a result of this and felt that guests should at least be able to use the steam room without paying. However, we have used the spa in our previous visit and it is very nice to relax in (shame about the cost!).

In general all the staff are very friendly and cannot do enough to help and assist.

We would certainly return to the Thalassa and has been the best hotel we have stayed with in Agadir in our experience."
"The service afforded by all the staff of this exceptional hotel would be difficult to better anywhere.  Breakfast is an excellent start to the day where Rachid and Khadijah always give you a warm welcome followed by that of the lady chef who makes wonderful omelettes.

Our luxurious room, with its lovely view of the garden and sea beyond, was an oasis of calm and elegance and perfectly serviced every  day.  However, up till now, that is just the beginning.

What we really came for was six days of health-giving thalassotherapy.  Concerning the spa, we say a special thank you to our friends in Reception, Imane, Lamia and Youssef who organised our programme of treatments.  We admired the professionalism of all who administered our treatments and give special thanks to ElHammoumi Ghali, Zahra Bouibker, Ait Assaaine Nawal and Boulahriss Bouchra."
"We were in sofitel thalassa, we had a great time and experience with all staff members who have been able to satisfy our needs, Nejwa had all time for us with her kindness
Thank you again for your time"
"I would give this place 10/10 if i could. Feels like a 2nd home! I will definitely be coming back in April. Immaculately clean, ALL staff friendly and go out of their way to make sure you are feeling comfortable. Staff always made sure me & my friend was safe at all times. I have never seen such amazing service before. The hotel is beautiful. They have their own private beach which is amazing. Everyone is happy and smiley all the time. Every single member of staff was lovely but a few stood out to us the most. Abdel at the reception gave us amazing first impressions, he showed us our room & also upgraded our room with a special surprise which was lovely, such a kind, helpful amazing man. Ash who does the shisha provided amazing service and always made us feel happy and welcome, he was lovely, looked after us every single day. Ghizlaine was lovely, she was so kind to us, again she made us feel like it was our second home, always asked if we needed anything to make our stay better but it was perfect. We met her at a private party they invited us to, she offered us drinks and upgraded our stay. Mohamed at the market restaurant was very nice, so polite and caring, looked after us, very helpful. Fatima such a beautiful soul who made us feel so special, she truly was amazing! Also Mounir and Basch lovely people. Lastly I would like to say this is the beat place I have ever been to. everything 10/10, not a single bad word to say. Thank you so much, beautiful place!"
"Classy Hotel and probably one of the best in Agadir.
Very good staff , breakfast super, location right on beach and outdoor pool great.
Large room with balcony .
On the minus side... in general the public area's are quite cold(January) and most people in the breakfast room were wearing coats and or scarfs !
When things ran out in the room(milk, tea ect) we had to request them instead of being replenished automaticlly by the maid. When this occured we were given more than enough, plus roses for my wife and chocolates 
These may be small things but would have expected more from this class of hotel
I was looked after by chef very well as I am gluten free..
Our trip was booked through Travelzoo so was very good value.
I would recommend if booked on a deal otherwise would be rather expensive."
"If your looking for a beautiful Hotel with some winter sun and AMAZING STAFF then look no further than this hotel 
The poor sister Hotel is right next door we booked 2 nights here in the Sofitel Thalassa sea and Spa and 3 nights in the Hotel Sofitel Agadir Royal Bay Resort , after going there today to compare hotels we were really disappointed and wanted to stay where we were . Thank you to the wonderful staff who made that happen. I want to give a big shout out to Aziz the manager who said we could stay, as we had already paid up front ,and being both sofital’s he was able to do that , your a star, thank you to the handsome Abolellotf who has a wonderful smile and is so welcoming and a lovely happy man, Mjid the hotels driver , Glacoss, Fatima, Bacha all so lovely, and not forgetting the bell boy Zakaria,  They are all an asset to your hotel chain Sofitel 
You have made our stay so memorable and it’s not over yet.  You amazing people ...!
Come and stay here it’s the best Hotel in Agadir , the service, the food, the location and of course the brilliant staff   Thank you all so much 
Last but certainly not least, thank you Ghizlaine, head of guest relations for upgrading our room when we arrived last night , you are so lovely you made our room look amazing 
We will certainly be coming back here. 😘"
"We stayed here for a week in September 2019. The hotel staff are highly professional and accommodating. The hotel itself is really cool, has nice, professional yet fun decor throughout the hotel and the rooms are amazing. Our room's aircon didn't work so we were upgraded for free, which was a fab surprise. This is probably the best hotel I've ever stayed at, when I consider everything included. The pool is great, with service being offered by your bed and the staff can bring over drinks and food. The spa is fantastic although expensive, and offers a huge choice of treatments by people who really know what they are doing. It was super clean. I think the professionalism of the staff is great. There is a great outdoor restaurant and entertainment at night. You walk straight from the hotel to the beach and the beach is lovely too. The breakfast is amazing, where you can request any dish of your choice as well as a buffet of hot foods, cold foods, pastries etc, fruit, yogurts. The restaurant in the hotel is one of the best (if not THE best) in Agadir. When we had room service, this was always fast and professional too. The staff who attend your rooms to clean are kind and professional. Like I said, this is probably the most modern and my favourite hotel I have ever stayed at. I wish this hotel was in every destination I visit - I would stay here every single time no doubt! Definitely will come back!!!! The price wasn't overly expensive however we did only book a standard double room which was still beautiful, however we were upgraded for free to a full sea-view room as our aircon didn't work. This room had a different lay out but was even better and had a private balcony."
"Sofitel hotel is a nice hotel located by the beach and a neighbourhood which is very clean. Because it is at the end of the Boulevard it is quiet what can be an advantage as a disadvantage.  The spa and thalassa are of high standing served with professional people sensitive to your need and request but also the prices are high. The swimming pool is big but the tiles should be repaired. The team working at the swimming pool is really great, we were most of the time dealing with Redouane, highly sympathic and professional in his way of dealing with the client. We were often coming there to feel comfortable and enjoying the sun and the quiet place. We had a room with partial see view which was well maintained but the shape is a bit uneconomic with the shower in the middle. Also the staff here was friendly and helpful."
"Our family stayed here this weekend and from entry to the room service around, we were very impressed. The heated pool is very clean. The hotel restaurant and bar are wonderful. We really appreciated Nejwa's customer relations and how kind and welcoming she was. Just like the other staff who worked there. the hotel is very convenient for everything and does a great job of making you feel relaxed and as if you are really in another world . Thank you!"
"Excellent staff members. They made my sister and I feel very welcome and made our trip very enjoyable by recommending local places to visit.

Farah El Fkhar was thoughtful and kind at all times and was happy to assist whenever we asked!
Abdellotif was very kind and helped us out numerous times! He even went out to purchase a hand-made souvenir for us when we were running late for our flight back to London - thank you! we are very grateful for that!
Also, other staff members including Fatima, Noura, Bacha, Mohammed, Hassna and Mustapha were very kind and always helped out when needed. 

The rooms were clean and facilities were splendid. The only thing I would recommend the hotel to improve on is the food they serve. The food served looks great but lacks the authentic Moroccan taste which was found within the restaurants in the city centre.

Overall, the journey was marvellous due to the people who were there! You've employed excellent human beings that truly take care of the hotel and their guests. Will come again!

"
"We were in Sofitel thalassa it was vert calm the hotel is very clean the employees are king and always ghere for the guests. The animation in the bar was also calm. We will comeback soon without hesitation."
"The best place to be . . . Excellent service from arrival to departure.
Staff is very very professionnal , friendly and all the time smiley.
We really enjoyed thé staying there and thank you again . ."
"The hotel is wonderful. Public areas quite stunning.  Great spa. But located at far end of croisette and a little isolated. Pool area is FAB but the beach terrace area  a little disappointing. Not very 5 star here ! Very relaxing. Great staff. "
"This hotel was recommended by Khalid who is a rep for Worldtomeet travel. He was fantastic from arranging airport transfers, excursions and he was always very friendly and professional.
I travelled with my friend and on arrival at the hotel, we were met by very friendly staff. We had booked a sea view room which had a wow factor. It was clean thanks to Halima, khadija, and the whole housekeeping team, and spacious, everything you need for a relaxing break. We always had a surprise when we got back to our room.

The breakfast was amazing and there was a whole variety of choice. Big thank you to Omar at the restaurant market who was working so hard and was there everyday, his customers service skills were so high. Thank you to Fatima Ezzahra too who was very friendly and easy to talk to.

The evenings were our favourite in the Amane bar. All the staff there, Fatima the bar manager, Chahine, Majid, Khalil and Imad. They made our stay so special we will never forget. Fatima prepared different outstanding cocktails for me and my friend everyday, and they prepared a special place for us to stay every night. We were made to feel like celebrities.. Fatima, you are amazing and no one else can prepare good cocktails like you do.
Munir the guest relations manager was always there to make sure that we were ok.

The live entertainment by Hind and Annas was so good, and relaxing. We preferred to stay in and listen to them all night. They are amazing at what they do and they connect with the guests very well. They are surely an asset to the hotel. 

I would highly recommend this hotel and I will be going back."
"My boyfriend and I wanted to escape the cold of the UK and enjoy some time out before Christmas. Sofitel Agadir Thalassa Sea & Spa made for a great get away (even in November). It was quite cool in the morning and evening but perfect sunbathing weather during the day time. In terms of the hotel, it was very clean and relaxed. I would definitely recommend staying in a sea and pool view room, as this really makes you feel as if you are on holiday, with the view from the balcony. The resort is right on the sea front and feels very safe.  The staff were brilliant, very smiley and attentive which made our trip entirely. The team around the pool were super efficient and polite, especially Mohmed and Yamiss, they were fab! What was also great, was the fitness suite and there was a list of classes available to all guests. However, as the hotel was a little quieter in November, the personal trainer Saad, helped me train to get the best out of my time in the gym. He showed me different techniques and also took my WhatsApp so that in the week if I wanted to train again he would help me - a great way to work off the delicious buffet breakfast!"
"The house keeping supervisor Rachid and Abdelwahed had been very helpful and all our needs were met by the above mentioned staff
Fatima the restaurant supervisor was very helpful .She has very good communication skills The kitchen staff and food was excellent 
We will recommend this hotel ."
"Great location on the beach.  The staff is extremely helpful and friendly.  Excellent dining and facilities. Further from the main part of the town but that gave a chilled atmosphere. It was no problem getting to the Souks and the main parts of time.  Extremely secure and safe location. Lots of fabulous fresh fish, Moroccan food and cute desserts and lovely treats freshly cooked up,  Would definitely return."
"I spent a lovely week at this hotel , I’ve been warmly  welcomed by Ghizlan , outstanding service and great assistance always wheeling to help with a lovely smile . The food was just amazing especially the breakfast many thanks for Jihane and her care of the details . 
The pool was nice and calm suitable for lovely sunny days . I would definitely recommend this hotel and I’ll be back next year for an other lovely experience ."
"A lovely hotel in a great quiet spot on the beach, a super place to relax. If you like walking, plenty of lovely promenade along the seafront. Further from the main part of the town but that gave a chilled atmosphere. Lots of fabulous fresh fish, Moroccan food and cute desserts and lovely treats freshly cooked up, I particularly enjoyed the prawns. I loved the contemporary artwork and airy architecture. The staff here make this hotel though and having arrived with a real need to rest and recharge, we were wonderfully looked after from Basha's warm welcome and fond farewell. Rachid at breakfast, Lahssen in The Market - keeping my wine for me, Abdelwahed who looked after our room and spoilt me with cakes at turn-down time, Said by the pool, Fatimazahre and Chamina at The Market looking out for everyone in the morning and evening, Khahil on the terrace,  Sandra on the front desk who helped with my queries about the area and Zakaria, Ghizlane and Asma! You all made our stay genuinely relaxing and restorative. A big thank you."
"The hotel is very nice but it’s staff are the asset that make it shine. The helpfulness and friendliness of the staff is faultless. Mohamed one of our waiters really looked after us. Also special thanks to Ghizlaine Elkabous who is guest relations manager who really looked after us. Thank you all and also to the chefs who cook some beautiful cuisine. "
"A quiet place where zen attitude and relaxation are the main pillars of your stay. Had a room with a unique and beautiful view. The breakfast buffet is just delicious: healthy meals and fresh juices. Its so good to be in morocco!
Special thanks to the team: the ha happiness soldiers who work hard to surprise you, anticipate your needs and make you enjoy the experience. Thank you again for all!!"
"Enjoyed my time here and the service provided by the team. The breakfast buffet is great with a lot of choices... Thanks to the team who is always there to help and assist
I will be back soon for another memorable stay"

"One of the best hotels in Agadir very clean and the stuff are very friendly and helpful best place to spend a relaxing holiday highly recommended 
very close to the beach promenade
The  pool view is so lovely 
"
"The hotel was great. Staff was very kind and thoughtful. My dad celebrated his 70th bday and the staff was celebrating for his on 3 separate occasions. All because of Fatima at the reception :)
Thank you Sofitel, we will be back!"
"We booked two individual spa treatments (back wellness and oriental beauty dream) and used the spa and fitness area while staying at an other hotel in Agadir. 

Overall very relaxing and good experience. Attentive staff. 

+ good explanation of treatments and options
+ nice and clean Fitnessstudio with much equipment options for a Hotel Fitness 
+ Beautiful Hamam and Pool Area 

We felt welcomed and would recommend a visit."
"To me it was a great experience to have the chance to passe a staying in the  incridible sofitel thalassa, I wish everyone I know could have the opportunity to meet the lovely, kind, respectful persons who are working there.
I'd love to thank the hostess Chaima for always being smiling"
"Service is as expected in the price range. Excellent. Rooms a bit small but fully equipped, luxurious, clean. Staff is always at your service. Buffet and a la carte restaurant are top range. Will remain my go to when in Agadir"
"The best hotel to stay at is Sofitel Thalassa, service was excellent, people are very nice. The sheisha at night was amazing. The management team was very good, no problems at all. The breakfast was very nice, something different everyday. The staff and people were very welcoming too. Definitely coming back if we come to Agadir again. 

I would also like to make a special mention to simo from agadir journey 
(+212 677-753324) took care of all my excursions & my airport pick up & drop off."
"This hotel is Amazing. I had a great holiday there and I like the professional and friendly staff very much . Everybody was very good with us, especially Mr. Zakaria, the  hotel porter who helped us several times with many things during our stay in Agadir. I am looking forward to being there again."
"I like this hotel so much, it is simply a great place and honestly the service is really good ..
I was was surprised by the way they treat their guests with polite and friendly ways. 
I really recommend every one to visit it ❤️"
"Just returned from our third visit to Sofitel Thalassa Sea and Spa. My husband and I had another thoroughly enjoyable and memorable holiday. This is a very elegant and beautifully furnished hotel. The restaurants offer plenty of variety at breakfast and dinner with choices of both Moroccan and European dishes. Make your choice of chicken, meat or fish and it is cooked fresh for you. The choice of deserts are exceptional. Thank you Chef Samir. The staff are so attentive and friendly and whilst we see old and new faces, we always find the staff very helpful.  I must personally thank Rizlan of the management team who I can only describe as a true professional and huge asset to Sofitel. She is truly amazing and she made this trip very special for us, including arrangements for a wonderful birthday cake for my husband. The only downside to this trip was a number of cloudy days which I know Rizlan would have turned to sunshine if it were in her power to do so! "
"Our 4th holiday in beautiful Morocco at Sofitel Thalassa Sea & Spa in Agadir was absolutely wonderful. It was special this time round as it was our baby’s first holiday and we wanted him to have a brilliant time on holiday and most importantly a 
comfortable stay at the best 5 star hotel with a beautiful view of the sea 👌🏽👌🏽 

Firstly, the entire hotel was beautiful with a very contemporary/modern and artistic look through out. We had no doubt about the hotel as we already had a great experience of Sofitel in Marrakech. Secondly, our junior king suite was absolutely stunning with a mesmerising view and sound of the waves of Agadir beach. 

Our room was just perfect with the lounge and huge balcony looking out onto the hotel’s pool and the sea as mentioned above. It was everything that my husband and requested and maybe a little more 😊

Our thanks and appreciation goes out to all the hotel staff from reception, concierge, bar, breakfast staff to housekeeping. Everybody was always ever so helpful and accommodating especially when we were on our first holiday with our 5 month old baby. Our room was always topped up with all the amenities without having to make a request housekeeping were always at the door asking if we need anything. So we would like to say a great thank you to everyone and especially Husna and Latifa from housekeeping and housekeeping supervisor Halima who were absolutely amazing with their special touch and really taking care of us. We can certainly say that Halima and her team really did have that USP (Unique Selling Point) factor. 

Many thanks again Sofitel for your hospitality. 

Fahmina and Mohammed Azeem Rashid"
"My visit to Sofitel agadir from was outstanding experience.
The stuff , Reception, Resturant , all the facilities were excellent. No doubt I will Repeat the experience once again with my family.
Thank you Sofitel Managenent.
Regards"
"The hotel service is excellent, time spent was fantastic and found all the staff was friendly and helpful. I have really enjoyed the stay at the hotel. Ms Ghizlane was available all day night at the reception and pleasantly helping and guiding us."
"I’m back at Sofitel again this year and boy have I missed it. Again lovely experience lovely weather and great staff. Special thanks to Monir on reception who really sorted out any problems on the trip. 

Also this time had to get into shape as my health problems creeping in.
Saad at the gym was really helpful and really knows his stuff. He was always smiling and making sure I had enough water to drink etc....
I feel fitter and rejuvenated!
"
"We were here to celebrate our silver wedding anniversary so we were treating ourselves to a week of pampering. 
From the moment we arrived we were impressed by the greating and the hotel itself.
They upgraded us to a suite which had been layed out with heart shapes and petals which was a lovely gesture.
the hotel staff throughout our stay were very attentive, from the breakfast team to the pool staff. We tried to converse in French but the staff were more than happy to speak English. It has been the most looked after hotel experience we've had. 
The food at breakfast was fantastic , so much choice and you were never rushed. we did eat in the evening and the Market place restaurant was buffet style and the ither restaurant was traditional Moroccan food. it eas a pity the lunch menu from the pool restaurant wasn't open so we chose to head out.
Our last day was going to be long due to an midnight flight. They couldn't extend our room but the manager interveined and saw that we had a room at no extra cost. 
my only fault with the room was the rain shower, there was no pressure from the water and we had to rely on the hand held one. we did raise it but nothing changed. we just excepted it was a pressure issue. it was only when we were in the other room with the same style shower which worked perfectly,proved the shower in our suite was faulty."
"I booked myself a Moroccan bath with a therapist named Nadiya. 
The bath was an amazing experience and Nadiya just made it much better. 

I would like to thank the whole staff at the spa for their hospitality and professionalism and Nadiya in particular for her care to details and our comfort. 

Osama"
"I stayed at the Sofitel Thalassa for 2 weeks and loved my room and the hotel itself with the swimming pool and beach access. The hotel itself is beautiful. I went for breakfast and dinner to the hotel restaurant, Le Market and the staff is brilliant there. The waiter called Lahcen is a very attentive employee, helpful, knows what you want and always with a smile. He is a key member in the restaurant. 

The bed was not greatly comfortable, and the fact that they change the towels everyday even if put back on the rack and that all the lights are on, even in unoccupied rooms, goes against their supposedly environmentally friendly policy.

Apart from that, I highly recommend the hotel overall as the staff made sure it felt a bit like a home away from home."
"We have just returned from 11 nights at this amazing hotel on the most wonderful clean beach in Agadir. We had one of the Opera Suites which are of a very modern design. It was very spacious and overlooked a large garden with its own swimming pool, terrace and cabana.

The staff were so friendly and provided excellent service. A special mention for Mouna, our maid, for Khalil in the Amane Bar and for Lahcen and Yacine at breakfast and dinner in The Market restaurant. They all made our stay very special. We also enjoyed many evenings in the Amane Bar listening to Hind and Anass perform a diverse range of music.

We will certainly return!

We plan to return as soon as we are able."
"Wow. Wow. Wow. What a perfect end to 2 weeks in Morocco. Started at the Sofitel Marrakech, then Sofitel Essaouira, ending the vacation with 4 nights at Sofitel Agadir. Definitely the best and by far the highlight of our stay! 
The hotel itself is immaculately kept. The integration with the Sofitel next door means that kids club and themed nights can be accessed, as well as a playground. I travelled solo with friends and my 4yr old son and found every interaction a breeze. Staff are friendly and attentive, the staff around the pool work so hard in the heat and always with a smile. Breakfast is plentiful, the location although at the end of the promenade is still central and far enough to be peaceful and tranquil. Kids club was amazing, as was the nanny the hotel provided (ask for Hind!) She sent updates and pictures throughout the day, our kids loved her.
Room service came quickly and was delicious, kids meals are huge! 

Big thanks to Naime, the wonderful pool attendant. Bacha, who is the hilarious and charming concierge and the wonderful boom gate security attendant, who was so vibrant and welcoming and entertaining. 

Cannot wait to be back in Agadir and highly recommend the Sofitel.
"
"Great experience and service  with the amazing receptionist  Othman with good attitude  and beautiful smile and the helpful bellman Mourad , so very Thankful to Zakaria and Mustapha for the Fantastic presentation that made my days with beautiful atmosphere as an individual and international level from check in to check out. Very attentive, professional, personable. i work at Walt Disney Word Resort  Florida i felt a higher service as there. We had amazing nights there 
Highly recommended"
"The best out of every Sofitel chain hotels I’ve stayed. The new Agadir Sofitel ( situated next door to the main Sofitel) is by far the best ! The architecture is impressive, the art in the Lobby is a delight, the decor is excellent! The rooms are beautifully designed, very comfortable beds what everyone needs while in holiday. The staff very friendly, professional and helpful on the spot ! Thank you Agadir Sofitel !!"
"I'd really love to thank everyone in the hotel for having us living a memorial and a great experience in the city of Agadir. Everyone was pleased to help, specially Yousra the public relations agent who made sure we get everything we needed during our holiday.
We are looking forward to get back again."
"i spent my stay with my wife at the hotel, it was great. we had a sea view room. the staff are very nice and very welcoming. really an experience to redo .

Sofitel Thalassa Sea & Spa is an excellent place for a splurge. It is without a doubt one of the best place in Agadir"
"Had a great evening in sofitel bar drinking good wine with beautiful view and good music ! Definitely recommend it to have a drink with friends and to enjoy acoustic music with affordable prices !!!!!"
"We had an exceptional wonderful experience at this hotel is like an oasis with the calm and elegant service and great atmosphere.
Staff and Service,Everyone in this hotel works to make your stay as enjoyable as possible."
"This Sofitel is located at the far end of the coastal promenade- opposite end to the marina which is about 3km away. Lovely walk or taxis available. The hotel is modern in design and quite stunning. Internally the decor most certainly has a wow factor with large dramatic pieces of funiture and art work. They also have an excellent spa which is also open to non residents. Lovely pool terrace with plenty of sun beds and double cabanas. Pool bar and restaurant too- however service here a bit hit and miss. Also sun beds and cabanas on private area of beach directly in front of hotel. If going for a beach walk you need to head right when leaving hotel as area to the left is private land owned by the King ( leads to his summer palace) and military steer you away ! Bedrooms are spacious, well equipped and very comfortable. Great shower. Dining options at the hotel are very good- please see separate  reviews. Staff are generally very welcoming  and efficient but the pool bar /  restaurant  needs ' tightening up' in its offering.  A beautiful hotel and one of the best Sofitels I have stayed in. "
"I stayed in this hotel with my partner in April 2019. 

This hotel is magnificant, beautifully deocrated and tastful throughout. The customer service is immaculate. Facilities are brilliant. Food is overwelming high class standard. Entertainment is great i could not recommend this place any more it would not be possible. We haveso many fond memories of staying here and we are not so easy to impress. Hats off to Sofitel Thalasa and Spa team and the spa is BRILLIANT i had the best massage i have ever had in my life. Over looking the sea is the finishing touch. I will always look out for the sofitel branch again!
Very very pleased"
"What a beautiful place! The property itself is absolutely gorgeous in decor and the staff are amazing so helpful and professional. We had the breakfast buffet which was brilliant with so much choice and excellently cooked and presented. The poolside restaurant was great for snack and light lunches and the dinner was also fantastic.

With a small private beach you can enjoy the sand and look over the sea and its a lovely walk down the promenade to some local restaurants some of which offer a free transfer back to the hotel, perfect when you've eaten too much!

I loved Agadir as a place and definitely will be visiting again and there is no doubt I will stay at this hotel as its simply the best in the area!"
"From the moment we entered the hotel we knew we made the right decision.  The attention to detail was evident from the start.  What sets this hotel apart from all others, including other Sofitels is its location on an amazing beach and a staff that strives to please you in every way.  Each request was served with a smile and executed with pleasure.  This type of service is difficult to find but comes as second nature to the staff.  Although this is not an adult only hotel it feels as peaceful.  This hotel truly is the riviera of Marocco.  In my opinion it’s the best hotel in agadir and would not consider others."
"I visited Agadir in June and stayed at Sofitel. It was an exceptional experience. The staff are so attentive and polite, the rooms are well kept and cleaned everyday. Thank you to Hachim Sibar, Mohamed , Ghizleine"
"I and my friend had an amazing time and great stay in Sofitel thalassa in Agadir and we really loved the entire property especially the pools, the view, the breakfast and friendly Staff at the front desk.
Highly recommend and will come back for sure 
See you soon guys ❤️..."
"Very nice beachfront hotel with clean rooms. 
The stay was very short but comfortable and relaxing. The service is always impeccable and the WiFi is perfect. Had so much work done in the bar where everything is calm and work appropriate."
"My first stay in Morocco was in the Sofitel Agadir Thalassa Sea and SPA. Architecturally speaking, I am amazed by the design of the hotel and the general layout is astonishing. 
The reception area was especially decorated for us with beautiful Rose's petals and heart shaped balloons. 
Our room was on the 1st floor. A view on the ocean. 
Our room was also decorated.
Many thanks to the housekeeper who cleaned our room daily and provided us with daily amenities. 
Now the restaurant in which we had breakfast was on the pool and it was such a pleasure to eat while being completely relaxed. 
The pool area is lovely with plenty of sunbeds.
The SPA is the most elegant space in the hotel, luxurious and very calm. 
Thank you for a memorable and definitely satisfying stay. We are banning on booking again in December,  definitely worth the visit."
"Very well received and assisted by concierge Mohamed throughout our stay. Breakfast is superb but the dining options could be improved.
Pool staff very nice, with Redouane especially kind and helpful.
Spa treatments were very good quality also with super friendly ladies at the Spa reception."
"My husband and I are returning to one of our favourite hotels at the weekend! We love this hotel as we are always so well looked after by the team. It is a beautiful location, with lovely food a fantastic spa! We are looking forward to seeing all those who looked after us so well last time we visited Atif, Yasmin, Said, Fatima and Mustapha."
"Liasing with NAYJAR (fr the Commercial Dept) to cement our Anniversary Arrangements in all areas, was a pleasure, because she managed to interpret and deliver all our requests exceeding our expectations (inspite of the fact that English was her 2nd language).  From start to finish, our day was simply magical. Thank you Nayjar!

ARRIVAL : This Sofitel smells lovely as you walk in, and we were given a VIP reception, by the only person of Colour who was absolutely 1st class (unfortunately we didn't get his name & didn't see him again, because he went on holiday). He was outstanding, and was joined by HOUCINE in Reception, in giving us a very warm welcome.  Our party of 6, were each shown our bedrooms, saving the best to last for myself & Hubby, with a wonderful upgraded Suite, graced with a impressive Towel & scattered Rose Petal creation of 2 Swans on our Bed. This set the tone for the rest of our stay.

DINING:  For Breakfast & Dinner, we were presented with a generous array of all sorts of dishes (prepared specifically to your tastes), together with lots of lovely fresh fruit and freshly made fruit juices, in addition to the delicious Moroccan Tea.

We were always greeted warmly by the staff, who made such great efforts in providing a great service (unfortunately, I didn't manage to get all their names),  However, there was one person who we would like to single out called OMAR, who was instinctively Professional, Proficient and consistently attentive to our needs and requests during mealtimes.  He had a natural essence of authentic sincerity, (even when dealing with the occasional challenging client - unfortunately some of the guests lacked basic good manners and were sometimes impolite).  We all observed his quiet, yet outstanding service, which was sustained throughout our whole 10 day stay.  He is most certainly a great asset to this Hotel, and I do hope he receives the recognition and rewards that he deserves.  I would definately recommend him (something I wouldn't usually do). Many thanks Omar in making a major contribution to making our stay extra special!

Further thanks go to all the staff in Le Palais Du Jardin Restaurent who laid on a 1st Class Feast in every sense of the word, for our Anniversary Celebrations.  A big thank you goes to HABIB who made our cake, and for the lovely Singer with the Beautiful voice, who serenaded us so sweetly (along with all the staff), with their Anniversary Song.

A Big thank you also goes out to the staff that cleared and decorated the Beach Terrace and built the Arch for our Vow Renewal Ceremony on the Beach.

Our Rep NOURDINE was also great in arranging our luxury Airport Transfers, as well as the great activities (Agadir Tour, Camel Ride, Quad Biking, which were all great fun).  The only one we unimously didn't enjoy, was the trip to Marrakech. The Tour Guide had no knowledge to impart, and constantly said he was starving. We felt unprotected in his care and did not enjoy the trip.

Moroccans are very friendly, welcoming people!

NEGATIVES: 

(a)  I was unimpressed with the rudeness of a Security Guard, who totally ignored my Hotel pass (which I was never usually asked to present) - I later found out he was new (his behaviour different to the rest of the staff), and he did apologise for his behaviour.

(b)  My Crystal Cake Decoration is missing, and has yet to be be returned, despite my requests.  I've now contacted Nayjar in the hope that she can intervene on my behalf to get my missing Crystal Cake Decoration returned to me asap."
"The Concierge took the time to greet us properly and show us to our individual suites which was met wit cheers. The bell hop were excellent, always smiling and and prepared hot Moroccan tea with sweets after a long journey. Excellence was the experience for the next week. Omar was our attendee at breakfast he has a great personality and although he did not speak english we understood each other. Mustafa prepared the best sea bass for dinner. The food was excellent and the bed was extremely comfortable. My views of the beach were the best."
"Had an amazing time at this hotel. The hotel is lovely, the rooms are great and the staff are amazing, so polite, friendly and helpful. One of the Waiters in particular called Omar was fantastic he was so attentive to my family during breakfast and dinner we all looked forward to seeing him each day, such a kind individual. I would definately recommend this hotel to family friends and hope to come back some day in the future."
"The hotel was beautiful and the staff are very welcoming! They will provide you with everything you need and will wait on you hand and foot - which makes you feel very special. The rooms are lovely, fresh flowers and snacks left daily - I so wish I knew where to buy the free shower/lotion products, as I miss the smell so much! The food was amazing and I miss the fabulous mint tea. However, outside the hotel was a huge contrast - I was called names (which I cannot repeat on here) as I walked along the seafront, ignored in the shops and I lasted exactly 5 minutes in the Souk, as I felt so uncomfortable! I have travelled all over the world and never been to country where I have felt so unwelcome by the locals.Luckily the hotel and staff were great and so we spent most of our time there."
"We booked four rooms for three nights and took our family to celebrate the milestone of our Pearl Wedding Anniversary. The staff were all extremely friendly and nothing was too much trouble. They noticed immediately (from our passports) that it was our middle son’s birthday the day after we arrived, and so at breakfast on the first day he was serenaded in Arabic French and English by ten or so of the lovely staff at breakfast, much to his embarrassment and our amusement !

We had the buffet supper the first night which was delicious and a fantastic range of grub. Wine comes in four colours in Morocco: red, white, rose and gris (literally grey), the last one being delicious for rose drinkers who like their wine very pale. About 5 or so different qualities of each colour depending on wallet and taste. 

Breakfast each morning can be taken either in the dining room or on a lovely spacious terrace, with huge buffet and a lovely spread, coffee etc arriving promptly.

Back to the hotel. The common parts are spacious and well appointed. The rooms were very clean and well appointed, if a little dark and not oversized but still perfectly good for us and with quite ‘French’ (i.e. confusing) switches etc. We had lateral sea view rooms, each of which had large balconies (we faced north west). The pool area was lovely, plenty of sun beds and bigger beds etc to crash out on. Pool at the correct temperature as well. Outside bar with attentive staff and a lovely lunchtime restaurant as well. It’s still quite low season so hotel, we suspect, was quite quiet, but the usual frustrating business of people putting their towels out early on the sun beds... (very ‘low rent’ in my humble opinion).

According to t’Missus, and the children (mid 20’s), the Spa was excellent and all appeared to be buffed and polished and tweaked and teased and re-painted appropriately. I didn’t bother, being the chest thumping alpha male.

The Hotel is on the south end of the large, clean and excellent beach, and the walk (on the beach or the promenade) is worth it all the way to the Marina (45 minute route march, up to 90 minutes if you’re dawdling). Lots of places to stop for drinks and eats on the way and practically no pestering (but it’s still low season so whether that changes I do not know).

In a nutshell, we loved it. Sofitel is a quality hotel chain so nothing is cheap, as such, but we certainly didn’t feel as if we were ‘taken for a ride’ at any stage."
"When walking into the hotel reception, we found the staff to be very friendly and helpful. They offered us some Moroccan tea and pastries which were delicious. When getting to our ground floor room, we were a little disappointed by the condition of some of the fixtures and fittings. We mentioned this to the reception, who moved us to a larger and more modern room. The beds are extremely comfortable. The food was the highlight of the stay, with so much choice and variety that you would not want to go anywhere else for food. The pool and outside areas were very clean, modern and tidy and were well staffed for people wanting drinks and food. 

The location is very good as you can walk along the beach or seafront to the marina. We would like to thank the staff for looking after us as well as making a cake for my mother’s birthday, which was delicious."
"The family and I had an amazing trip here! The kids loved the pool and the food was always incredible: such variety! The best part of the trip has to be the service. Specifically, Mounir and Hicham made our stay the best it could be. They were always friendly and professional, and they would go the extra mile to ensure we had a great time! We look forward to seeing them again in the future."
"The hotel is really beautiful and well located - if you want the quieter side of Agadir. It is at the end of the corniche - not far from the Royal palace. Gives you the better part of the beach and long pleasant walks to the marina.
Rooms are well designed - nicely decorated (although was expecting the superior one to be  slightly bigger and the layout was a bit odd with the shower).
Service is great and all the staff really tries hard to make your stay pleasant.
Breakfast buffet is really good, wide choice and a fab fresh juice bar.
So overall a great hotel - (it comes with a price tag for the area) & we will definitively go back. 

But there are a couple of small things which need to be worked on:
- pool: the bottom tiles are loose and falling apart. Not the best to walk on 
- some of the rooms are communicating ones - we unfortunately had one of those. It is so noisy - you literally feel you are in the same room as your neighbour. Note that the hotel changed our room so was a nice gesture and we ended up in a super quiet one (#happy) but never good experience to have to change room (in my book)
- some areas of the room if you look closer do start ageing , shower was full of scale (got cleaned up after we pointed it out)

Not a big deal overall but hence why it is was not a perfect rating
But hey - won’t stop us to be back"
"Staff were fantastic. Particularly Khadija, Jamal and Samir in the breakfast room. 
Beach is immediately next to the hotel and had good 3ft waves when we stayed making it v convenient for surfing. The hotel has boards you can rent."
"housekeeping was very poor despite several complaints.
the last day of my stay the room hadn't been done again at 5 pm
3days of 4 i had to complain at the reception that the room hadn't been done.
this is not acceptable in such a hotel"
"Wow! Words can not describe what an amazing trip we’ve had. 
All the care from the staff, from the pool to housekeeping to reception going out of their way to do what they can for you. Little touches are always considered, from arriving in to the room to rose petals on the bed and a swan crafted from towels to Easter Sunday having a Belgian chocolate egg left on our table for us. The food is impeccable, can not fault it at all. Room was serviced twice a day to a very high standard. They have made our trip so special, not to mention how beautiful the hotel itself actually is. Thank you for everything.

A special thanks to Mustafa on security for helping us out at the start of our holiday, truly honest and caring man.

Love from Honor Gilmartin and Lewis Denwood."
"This was our 2nd visit to the hotel. We had booked a junior suite and it did not disappoint.
The only criticism I would have that I had to wait more than 2 hrs to check in and I arrived well after 1pm.
The restaurants all served great food. Our valentines dinner was amazing ! 
The pool restaurant had nice food but the service was sporadic. I had to ask for the menu 3 times. And wait 40 mins for them to take the order. This only happened on one occasion but was a little disappointing.
The spa facilities were great and the ladies were lovely.
Overall our stay was good. Fatima at reception was once again so friendly and nothing was too much bother. 
And I would definitely recommend the hotel despite some little hiccups. "
"We love stayi) at this hotel. The hotel is very friendly and offers plenty of options for things to do. The staff go out of their way to make children feel very special. The house keeping staff are fabulous, Leila always manages to surprise the kids with her little touches in our room. Thank you for such a comfortable stay!"
"we'll be back for sure 
Me and my husband are very very satisfied at first we really loved the flowers on our room ! we loved the food all the staff. we gonna never forget these nights in Amane bar with those adorable talented duo Hind and Anes very soft very classy ) Thank you for letting us enjoy that incridble voice singing our favorite songs 
Thank you guys thank you Thalasa"
"The Thalassa Sea & Spa is a very nice Sofitel-level hotel. Clean, confortable and quiet; perfect for ""getting away from it all"". Excellent for those who don't really need to go into town; everything you need is right there, including direct acces to the beach. Carefull, there are two Sofitels in Agadir situated side-by-side, on the ocean front. On extended stays, you may wish to pop over to the other Sofitel for added variety in reastaurants or entertainment.
Staff are efficient and friendly yet discreet (they don't overdo it).
Special mention for Mounir, who was always making sure all was well."
"This was mine and my partners first holiday together and first time to Morocco. Such a beautiful place. People are friendly food is incredible little bit of mither from local trying to sell but you expect it. Hotel was incredible! Again staff can’t do enough for you! Friendly and well manored. Hotel it picturesque! Amara bar is incredible with live music and the best staff I’ve had the pleasure of meeting. Fatima ( bar manager) and her team - fouard, hitcham,youcef,Hassan and imoud were incredible hosts and would come back again 100%! 

Callum"
"I would truly like to thank all the « magnifique » staff of Sofitel Agadir Thalassa & Spa.
My sister and myself had a marvelous time at the property.
 
From the valet parking at the entrance with a genuine big smile, through the housekeeping and ‘equipiers’, and the very cool staff from the surf school, all of them made this trip unforgettable.
Special thanks to Ayoub (reservation) Abdelatif & Hicham (Front Desk), Mounir (Guest Relations) and Imad (Breakfast/Restaurant).

You guys bring the hotel alive!
Belen"
"Firstly I would like to thank Ghizlane!!! She is such a good manager always helped us. Also Nora she has helped us with reception request we had. Very good managers. Hotel is very very nice. 5 stars all the way. Nice rooms nice breakfast. Khalifa in breakfast was very good too. Thank you sofitel thalasa "
"First Impression as soon as we arrived with my sisters was wow!!!. Arrived Tues evening (exhausted from travelling several hours) - we were welcomed with a smile from the concierge team, as we waited to be checked in - they offered us a welcome Moroccan Tea and pastries - it was lovely. 

We had dinner at the hotel restaurant, greeted with a welcoming smile from Lahcen - who looked after our every request.

Throughout our stay we were truly welcomed with a 5 star treatment  - thank you so much to the wonderful Lahcen, Omar, Imad, Jamal, Atif and Ouadie was always there to greet you with a smile and a joke.  It made our holiday such a remarkable and fantastic stay. 

The hotel amenities, rooms and decor was modern and beautiful. The hotel lobby, reception was beautifully decorated and everywhere in the hotel was kept tidy and clean.  The room was always clean and smells lovely.  The food was fantastic with so many varieties to choose from  - we were overhelmed.

Our thanks to Abdellatif in reception for helping me and my sisters with our last minute request - it made our last day truly relaxing. 

Overall, we had such an amazing time, we didn't want to leave.  For the few days we stayed the at hotel, we got to know such wonderful staff and will be forever our friends.

We will surely and undoubtedly come back again possibly in Dec if not early next year. 

 I highly recommend Sofitel to anyone who wants to visit Agadir if you want to have a relaxing, fun and enjoyable holiday.

We will miss everyone especially Lahcen, Omar,Ouadie and Imad!!! We are ever so grateful to have known such great individuals."
"We came on a Saturday evening had a few issues with the room but Abdulattef at reception was exceptional and sorted out the issue and gave us a nice room which made our stay all the more enjoyable, we also had a late flight and my request to hek out late was no issue either so i thank him very much, hotel looks really nice and elegant very family friendly and all staff in general are very kind. Thank you Sofitel Thalassa i would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking to stay in Agadir"
"We enjoyed our stay, but had some difficulties at the beginning with the type of room rented. As a typically french hotel, there are very few rooms with twin beds. The reception had some difficulties to manage our request, but they finally found a good solution. Thank you for that. 
We came for the sea and for the wellness at Thalassa. This experience was really wonderful. I want to name two special ladies who tokk care of us: Nadia, who took care of my first Hamam and Hanan, who made beaty treatments. They were both very professional, friendly and one could notice how much they like the work they are doing. Simply relaxing.
"
"A lovely hotel, the rooms with beachside view ( ours was 262) have a fabulous view of the dunes ,sea shore and the Kings Palace in the distance. Predominantly French guests but most staff speak reasonable English. The staff work very very hard and are delightful but it appears they are poorly lead and let down by the reception and housekeeping staff which makes for some eccentric but irritating oversights , for example one day there was a flannel in the bathroom, next 4 days not; we rang down to reception for breakfast tea bags 3 times without results then another time loads of camomile teabags and sugar appeared but no breakfast tea  or milk. There was never any soap in the bathroom, just shower gel. However we had a beautiful rose in the room daily ( would’ve preferred hand soap but it’s a lovely gesture) The bed was blissfully comfortable and the rooms are very quiet ; everywhere is spotlessly clean and smells gorgeous . The evening entertainment was brilliant but for all the wrong reasons!! 
All slightly nit picky I know but all easily sorted with better management and training. We would definitely come again. "
"Well maintained hotel beautiful and very warm room with comfortable beds well maintained bathroom heated pool and well maintained beach well arranged and maintained with beautiful deck chairs accè wiffe free and fast generally well maintained hotel"
"I was in the Sofitel hotel twice. I can recommend it to everyone. Delicious food, great spa and the most important a great service and a really good gym for those people who like to exercise. There is a really good coach Saad thats keeps you motivated and who know different types of techniques for different desired outcomes."
"My mother, brother and I stayed at the hotel for 4 nights. We each had our own room but when we checked in they weren’t actually available yet! I’d advise making sure that you can head straight to yours, as after your travels it would be nice to settle in. The service as we arrived was adequate however we weren’t treated as though the ‘customer is everything’. The rooms were lovely. Bed shower outside area (not a great view of the opposing hotel). The rooms facing inwards to the pool would be a much better option as the views would be much more welcoming, if you’re willing to splash the cash. Pardon the pun. The hotel itself has a quality set up! Buffet restaurant for breakfast and dinner, pool bar for lunch and a traditional Moroccan restaurant for those culture vultures. There’s a bar with live music and sport shown (to my surprise, although they only really show French or Spanish teams). The gym and spa is top notch - would highly advise taking advantage of them. 
The sun beds around the pool and great as well as the pool itself. The service around the pool when it is busy is something to question. Waiters/waitresses running around but very little seems to be served. Be prepared to ask 3 times for a Coke Zero. 

Overall, the hotel is large and the staff are very friendly and helpful. They recommended two restaurants we ventured too which were perfect. It is big and when it’s busy, you are one of many so service can be slow. However they do try their best and it made the trip to Agadir much more relaxing having a splendid hotel to settle in. P.s brush up on your French before you go... "
"My daughter and I returned from our holiday at your hotel,, we had a wonderful stay the staff were wonderful especially ABDELLATIF on the reception desk, we couldn’t fault anything this a fantastic place to stay all the staff in the breakfast restaurant were most attentive and even made a special drink for my daughters cold ,the staff at the pool were also great , Thank you for making our stay so lovely, we can’t wait to come again next February and thank you again ABDELLATIF, Patricia Huckle and Victoria Paterson"
"Both me and my partner travel a lot and do compare among us, never normally write reviews but this visit to Morocco makes us feel like home so deserved our review, booked the Sofitel because it was my partners birthday and he wanted to visit Morocco, from the moment we entered the hotel we where greeted with exceptional customer service. All our needs was met nothing seems too much for the team me personally I couldn’t fault none of the staff there, before reaching I emailed the manager and let them know it was my partner birthday and my lovely Ghizlaine surprise us with a room upgrade to a suite a birthday cake my partner and I was over the moon with tears, I could go on and on about this hotel just want to say thank you very much to these staff I can remember, first and foremost Ghizlaine, Brahim at the atlantique restaurant, Aziz Yasmin,Abdelouahed the lady that does the entertainment and the lady chef at breakfast,all the staff here are so good thank you Sofital staff and making us feel like home and such a warm welcome we will be back very soon wish I could give more than 5 star"
"Thank you very much anther great stay in the Sofitel Thalassa, this is my 5th time to stay. I would like to thank the following people particularly, Rhali in the gym for getting my fat husband less fat and healthy, Bacha the concierge who was extremely helpful and good natured, thanks to Mohammed the other Concierge  who was also kind and helpful. Thank you to Sahid who works at the pool for his work ethic. The security guards do a great job, a big thank you to the guards near the beach. Thank you for looking after our safety. 
See you again next year."
"We had a fabulous time in this Sofitel. Everything is so modern and stylish, definetly wasn’t what I expected, it was even better. All the place was spotlessly clean
And the staff is so friendly and helpful, thank you for an amazing stay"
"From the beginning to the end of January we stayed at the Sofitel
Thalassa Sea & Spa for holidays.
It expected us a modern & avant-garde seeming 5 star hotel, that you
would have expected more in the center of Paris. Nevertheless, on the
first tour trough the hotel area, we immediately noticed that the entire
area was very clean and all the furniture was proper maintained. Over
the course of our stay, we were able to convince ourselves that many
hard-working employees were busy keeping the hotel complex on a top
level in terms of visual appearance. Starting from the pool attendant
over the gardener, the service & housekeeping personell... up to the
security guards... all of them were ""almost"" very friendly and
accommodating. We would particularly like to highlight the staff of the
housekeeping (Mme Halima and M. Abdelwahed) of the service de soir, who
have taken special care of the well-being of the guests. The wishes
expressed during a chance conversation with the governess of the hotel
were implemented the same evening as a matter of course and, to our
great surprise, complemented by a warm gesture in form of a flower
bouquet by Mrs. Khadjia Dghoughi. Such an individual and above all
guest-oriented response to guest feedback on the spot of a manager, we
have never experienced during our countless stays in 5 star deluxe
hotels ... !!! At this point again a big thank you for this
extraordinary and unparalleled performance. The CEO of Sofitel Thalassa
sea & spa in Agadir is fortunate to have such a motivated, professional
and equally dedicated department head in his team.
If there is any constructive feedback on the performance of the Front
Desk staff allowed, at this point, many guests would be happy to see in
the future, that the Front Office staff spend more of their energy
putting the smaller wishes of the guests into their hands rather than
giving an explanation day by day, why something supposedly should not be
possible. (Just an example: the exchange of large banknotes in smaller
bills, so that taxi drivers can be payed or to have enough tips in stock
for the employees) Sometimes it's the little things that make the
difference between average and excellent service.
We would like to take this opportunity to thank all the staff of the
Sofitel Thalassa Sea & Spa for giving us an unforgettable stay in
Agadir. In this sense, we look forward to the next time and remain

Sincerely

Sven.J.Stiller"
"The location was ideal: sea front, right at the beach, at the end of the walkway going all the way to the marina (a nice 4,5km walk). This is a beautifully decorated, stylish hotel. The rooms were clean and had a nice balcony. The restaurants offered a lot of variation of both local and European style dishes. The desert buffet was to die for :-). But the cherry on the cake was the always smiling personnel."
"After two weeks in cold, wet, miserable Paris I was desperate for some sun. I looked and found pure sunshine in the forecast for Agadir, Morocco and booked a flight. From the moment you walk through the door the staff is incredibly kind and friendly. You will be met with mint tea and delcious cookies and nothing but happy smiles.

My room was modern, comfortable and had a sea view. WONDERFUL breakfast buffet! Securtiy all over.

The outdoor pool and beach are both terrific and the wait staff will take good care of you. Chairs and towels are plentiful and there is a full bar, a restaurant and beach/pool side service. Camel rides on the beach in the late afternoon/sunset. Say hi to Chocolate and Cappuccino! They are very friendly.

The super spa tended to my every need - the ladies who run the spa/desk are just lovely and want you to pamper yourself. Fatima, the physiotherapist is very professional and will get your body back to feeling great in no time. I recommend the 80 minute massage with her. Theres also a hair salon on site!

I walked around the strip of hotels and after popping into the other resorts I think the Sofitel Thalasso is the best choice in Agadir Bay. It’s certainly the most elegant, friendly and most modern. It is rated as a 5 star property. If you are a luxury traveler just keep in mind a 5 star in a thrid world country is not like a 5 star in Paris.

Go and enjoy yourself!  One note, if you want to go to the souk, ask the hotel to speak to the taxi driver so they take you to the ""SUNDAY SOUK"" you dont want to spend your day driving all over and getting frustrated so the taxi driver can get some commissions unless you like that sort of thing."
"This is possibly the best hotel in Agadir. Everyone that worked at the hotel were very friendly and the customer service was impeccable. The hotel sent a birthday cake and decorated my bed with roses for my birthday. Hope to come back soon!"
"I stayed in this beautiful hotel for 7 days the last week of January. The staff were amazing and very accommodating. The breakfast, lunches and dinners were all delicious. Breakfast is a buffet with plenty of choices. While I didn’t get a lot free time to enjoy the outdoors, I enjoyed the time I had. There was plenty of comfortable beds and loungers by the pool and in the private area on the beach. Food and drink service is available outdoors as well. The beach is also very clean. They have rental shop and surf lessons. Would be a great place for vacation!!! I’d love to come back!! "
"Excellent service all round highly recommend ,good food, staff very helpful ,good  security service felt very safe.  great facilities onsite ,not far to travel  to local  shops and  fast food  area .very friendly  people  in town  and very  helpful "
"We spent 1 week on end of January, the hotel is excellent and the services , the staffs are Fantastic.
We had breakfast and dinner at the hotels and the buffet was so delicious, it was quality than quantity. The tagine was so good I ate them everyday ! the room is always being tidy nicely and we were in one of their suit it was excellent room.
January is cold in Maroco(in the eve specially)I didn’t swim I did gym instead and the gym had great machines.
So overall , it’s an excellent choice for an hotel you won’t be disappointed.
This is my second time there and before that I was in the old Sofitel which is next to it, and I always had great moments."
"Hands down one of the best hotels I have stayed in. The rooms are stunning and the balcony views are fresh. The cleanliness is exemplary and the staff are extremely friendly. Great pool and private beach. Lovely modern decoration inside."
"After a great week in the hotel in January 2018 I was concerned that our trip for a week in January of this year may not have been as exceptional - I should not have worried!
Once again we had a wonderful week and I won't repeat all of the positives. Suffice to say that we had no negatives.
The weather was great and we had an ocean view room; what a joy after the cold, grey and wet weather in the UK!
The key ingredient to this hotel's success, however, is the staff. Without exception, they are warm, generous, friendly and welcoming. I am not talking about 'have a nice day' platitudes but about genuine smiles and engagement.
I do not have all of their names but would mention Abdulwahd who could not have been more helpful in the evening room turndown. Yacine and Lembatipti (?) who looked after us so well in the restaurant with of course the excellent chef, Mustapha!
Said around the pool, who was so attentive to our every need last year, remembered us and excelled again this year ably assisted by his colleague Mustapha.
The hotel is spotless, beautifully decorated and scrupulously maintained and we shall definitely be back next year.
Morocco is a wonderful country filled with charming people with values that we could all learn from."
"We spent Christmas here, such a great hotel! It has everything that you can possibly want for a relaxing stay; gym, spa and a lovely pool area. Beautiful view over the ocean. The staff is fantastic and really serviceminded. We were very well taken care of and enjoyed breakfast and dinner. The service by the pool was spotless. 
We can really recommend this hotel if you want to have great service, good food and a relaxing stay."
"We visited the hotel on 5th January till 10th January and we loved every minute if it! A great place and great service from everyone. A special thank you to Ghizlane who went over and above her ability to help me find my lost mobile phone  which I had left in a taxi. I can’t thank her enough for her level of professionalism and support which she showed in my moment of stress. I also had emailed the hotel before to say it was my anniversary and they had fulfilled all my requests. My bedroom was decorated beautifully with fresh flowers and a cake was left for us to celebrate in style! Thanks so much for making our stay so special. Insha’Allah we will definitely return, next time with our family."
"Terrific place. Very competent and friendly staff. The food is amazing. It's a great place to relax take a walk at the beach and get some beauty treatment . If you can't stand a lot of young kids this might not be the place for you. It's definitely a welcoming place for families. During rush hour  the breakfast buffet can get busy but the amazing line cooks are always friendly and helpful

And i wanted to give special thanks to our housekeeper Aumaima and her supervisor Halima who helped find something that I was stupid to loose, very kind , very professional, very engaged service . A real pleasure"
"It was a lovely weekend in Agadir, the city, the weather and the hotel were all perfect. It is a pity that there was no many tourists in Agadir, everyone goes to Marrakech.I asked when booking, when checking in and the same day for a late check out but I was told I have to empty the room at 12:00 because guests were expected to check in. Too bad since the hotel was clearly empty!"
"At arrival we had a warm welcome. Wonderful room with an amazing view to the ocean and very big and beautiful balcon. The bar is amazing with a lot of nice drinks and snacks,i also enjoyed the live music in the evening so much. The manager Fatima and her staff Hicham,Choîb ,Foad, Ossama and Jawad took excellent care of us. Was the most beautiful holiday i ever choice and me and my friends will be back soon. Recommend!!!"
"The Sofitel Agadir Thalassa Sea and Spa is a fantastic modern hotel in the new Sofitel Stlye. Sofitel is a luxury brand and commands luxury prices. The Agadir Sofitel works hard to meet European and Far East standards and for  Morocco achieves this. It is the best hotel by far in Agadir.

Rooms, we stayed in a sea / pool view Deluxe Suite. Fantastic, this is a real 5 Star hotel so you expect good standards so I won't bang on about pillows, which were very soft by the way. It's the little things , Nespresso Coffee machine plentifully replenished daily, the comp water, fruit, and Hermes soap that set this  room apart from hotels labled 5 star but not close to European standards elsewhere in Agadir.

If you have really high standards , this is the only place that comes close to 5 stars as we know it.

Obviously the hotel is spotlessly clean - housekeeping is excellent. 

The hotel is at the Extream West end of the promenade, opposite end to the marina, fish market and south of the famous Souk. Concierge will arrange day trips - outside you will find lines of local taxis willing to give you a day trip to the Souk, Kasba, Marina, ect. Generally they can be trusted but find one you like who is friendly and speaks English, they all speak French and Arabic. For quick taxi rides the current rate is 20 to 30 Diram for tourists. The Souk is well worth a visit. Morocans are friendly honest people but drive a hard bargain, exploring the souk alone is great depending on how you like hustle. It's very authentic.

Sofitel - reception was very efficient, There is a City tax in all hotels which is not prepaid and will be added it's about £3. Day. A credit card charge was taken on arrival for hotel extras - useual practice. Our room was ready by noon , we had welcome tea, and were in the room quickly. Very efficient and courteous reception.

The pool and spa are the main focus , we were very lucky , the December weather was exceptional 25/26 everyday and sunny. sunrise 8am sunset 6:30pm. The pool again is fantastic, lovely beds , cabins, loungers, towels. There is a private beach and lots is security the hotel is very safe. There is a lounge terrace overlooking the pool , lots of places to sit, pool food and drinks are served quickly and a very high standard. Pool staff again very friendly and efficient. Sofitel aiming for those 5 *****. 

Inside the spa, there are many treatment areas , a sea water hot pool (200dhm day) cold spa pools and relaxation areas , spa treatments are extensive and similarly priced to Europe,this is a premium brand hotel its expensive.

Inside the hotel is beautifully decorated, modern , modern art , Christmas was coming and the decorations were going up. Unfortunately I will be gone by Christmas but If your on your way for Christmas you will have a fabulous time. Lots of quiet spaces, good bars, entertainment , high class , piano, jazz, ect.

Food, excellent and expensive 5 star food, Starters £10 mains £20 roughly, obviously there are many options along the prominade, but treat yourself a few times to dinner, or brunch served on the beach front cafe £35 unlimited. It's all very good standard, 

In summary this is a true 5 star hotel. It's 5 Star service and accommodation. It's the best hotel in Agadir. I know Agadir very well and have stayed in many hotels. I'm happy to answer any question and hope this review is helpful.

To the manager and staff , thank you for an excellent stay.

Mrs Reid Room 111 - 1/12-6/12 ."
"On arrival we were greeted by Fatima in reception and Houcine the bell boy. Both made us very welcome and to our surprise we were given a room upgrade and escorted by Fatima to a very nice suite. A great start to our stay  and it only got better as we took advantage of what the hotel had to offer. Breakfast included everything you could wish for and the personal service from Lahcen Ben Ali was above expectations. I must add however the hotel management need to consider replacing the toaster for a conveyor type model. Its location next to the show kitchen is far from ideal and tongs are required to remove bread from a very hot wobbly toaster. 
Although the hotel is 5* in most other ways the outside swimming pool does need broken and loose tiles replacing.  
All in all an enjoyable stay made particularly special by the friendly staff and should we return to Agadir the Sofitel will be our choice once again."
"We have just returned from a 7 night stay at Sofitel Thalassa in Agadir. It is a beautiful hotel, a real treat, true 5 star experience in the lovely city of Agadir. We found all the staff hospitable and celebrated our wedding anniversary in the hotel. The staff went out of their way to make this a special day for my wife and I and truly pampered us. A special thank you to Nadjia the Spa manager for all her efforts in making the day so wonderful. 

From the restaurant staff, pool boys, housekeeping, concierge etc we were always met with a smile and a friendly Bonjour and any requests or concerns we had were dealt with quickly. The service was of a high standard. I most definitely recommend this hotel for a relaxing break by the sea and it is great value for money for some winter sun if you can get some of the package deals going around off season. 

A couple of minor negatives is that the bed was not that comfortable and did give us a few aches and pains after a few days. We also found the food choices around the area slightly limited and not that easy to get to from the hotel as it is at the opposite end of the beach to the restaurants so it may be worth considering the half board option and going for the dinner at the hotel each night for convenience. The breakfasts are fantastic so be sure to at least get that included.

The spa facilities are amazing and although they come at a cost it’s worth having a conversation with the spa staff around what is on offer as it’s a real treat and very relaxing.

Overall, a lovely vacation, we hope to return! 
"
"What a lovely hotel right on the beach. Great staff, very friendly and extremely helpful and efficient. We loved every minute of our stay here and would highly recommend it. We were most impressed with Mustafa who serviced our room in the evening and his towel displays and the roses were just so cute, and the staff in the restaurant especially Lachen Ben Ali who was exceptional in his attention to us at breakfast  is a real credit to the hotel.  We hope to return soon."
"It was me and my wife’s anniversary and the staff at the hotel went beyond expectations lovely hotel friendly staff especially munir from reception who upgraded us to a suite 5 star service and the restaurant had lovely food. If your coming to agadir this is the place to stay well worth the money "
"We stayed at the Sofitel from 10th to 14th of November 2017, and the idea was to sneak out from the gray November days in Germany and to catch some sunshine, to relax and to enjoy Moroccan food and wine.

The Sofitel Thalassa opened business some 6 years ago, and is positioned in direct neighborhood to the Sofitel Royal Bay Resort. It is privileged to have direct beach access, as the promenade, which is separating all other hotels from the beach, is making a turn and is basically surrounding the Royal Bay Resort. Besides the Sofitel Thalassa only the Robinson Club, which is the last hotel at the southern edge of the hotel strip, has this privilege. The Sofitel itself is a beautiful design hotel with a total of 173 rooms and suites, we liked the open design and the lobby with white walls and black ceilings and design couches. The check-in was nice, we were asked to have a seat in the seating area, and were provided with tea and cookies. Our suite was super nice, as we have requested we were accommodated at the second floor, the big balcony and the view were amazing. We were surprised by the nice decoration of the room with a bouquet of fresh roses and some sweets and fruits - this was a very warm welcome! We decided to have dinner the first night in the ""Market Place"" restaurant, where a buffet style dinner was provided. We liked the fresh fish and also the main courses, made by order at the grill. The breakfast next morning at the same restaurant was very busy - but we had a nice table at the terrace. We noticed that the Guest Relations Manager - Mrs. Ghizlane El Kabous - went to most of the tables and greeted the guests in person and took time for small talks. Later on we met her at the pool area, and she asked again if everything is fine in our room, or if we have any requests or needs. Even we had no requests at all, it was a nice gesture, and we really felt that guests are taken care of in a very personnel manner. This is why we like boutique size hotels - often the service is more personal, and the stuff is more attentive. During our stay we took several walks at the beach, and even the Atlantic did not invite for a swim, it was still nice to walk with the feet in the water. It was also nice to have a walk at the beach promenade. The ""Corniche"" has it's begin at the Sofitel, and over 4,5 kilometers it passes by the entire beach hotel zone to end at the harbor shopping area. The last evening of our stay we visited the hotel bar, which was well visited by hotel guests. A DJ and a duo of musicians performed some live entertainment. After 4 days we returned back to Germany - the check-out was very easy, and as there was a little problem with our transfer, the hotel management immediately took action and solved the problem with a call to the travel agency. Our short stay at the Sofitel was most enjoyable, and we hope to be back in the future. Oh - one thing - we did not use the pool, but there is a serious problem with the mosaic tiles - many of them are missing - this is dangerous for anyone using the pool as the remaining mosaic tiles have sharp edges which can cause serious injuries. The hotel is aware of the problem, however, little cosmetic repairs are not the right answer to this problem. It needs a complete repair of the entire pool and a replacement of all tiles, probably by bigger tiles to not have the problem with the mosaic. Of course this raises costs for the hotel and inconveniences for the guests during the repair phase, but Sofitel is not only a name - it is a certain expectation by the guests, and I am positive that the management and owners will finally decide that they have to live up to the expectations of their valued guests."
"Beautiful hotel located right on the beach where you get the best sunset views.  I can't say enough for the all the staff who were so attentive. This hotel was exactly what we needed after spending a week in Marrakech and before heading to Portugal. We were pampered by the pool, at the restaurants and the relaxing spa.   The breakfast had a variety of items and eggs/omelets made to order.  Loved the fresh juices and freshly made crepes.
We were able to take long walks on the boardwalk, which starts by the hotel and enjoyed the restaurants by the beach.  Also enjoyed camel rides which were right on the beach.   There was entertainment nightly at the bar. Would definitely return to the Sofitel."
"Arrival was a bad start for us and the hotel. We was not picked up as agreed at the airport and our room was not tidy for personal belongings and waste from previous guest. After our complaint, the hotel's hosts have done their best and accommodated our desire for compensation with upgrading to suite and VIP service. Now we hope for full focus and expected high level of service for the rest of our stay. "
"Splendid location.  Beautiful hotel with good facilities and  its own beach.2 good sized pools.Very helpful and courteous staff. Common ares (lounges, bar, dining room, etc) are bright and roomy. Good views from most of the rooms."
"Thanks for room upgrade to suite.It was very good experience. Good service, nice staffs and good food. But I killed 2 cockroaches and found familes of red ants around complimentary fruits and snacks in my room. Need more attention to cleaness of rooms."
"Well were should i start?? Ahahha. I loooveeeeeddd sofitel. The service was top! Everyday cleaning in the rooms. We stayed there from 8 okt till 13 okt, and honestly i didn’t want to leave. Morocco really touched my heart. And ofcourse many many thanks to Rachid Ryali and Omar for the best service i could wishh for. There aren’t words enough to thank you all for my pleasure stay!! And i will definitely come back in shaa Allah. 

Kind regards,

Nora and Mohamed"
"
We visited the sofitel on our honeymoon. I alerted the hotel to the fact it was our honeymoon before we arrived (on the hope of a nice surprise!).
Unfortunately they didn't acknowledge the honeymoon until the 3rd night which is when they covered the room in rose petals, provided flowers and a cake etc which was very kind and a nice gesture. 
The hotel is stunning in everyway. The design, layout and cleanliness cannot be faulted.
It has it's own beach section which is nice.
There is entertainment on most nights which is fair to say is somewhat mixed. 
The service like most places in Morocco is very hit and miss. The first couple of days it was quite slow and arguably the friendliness a little false. Something must have happened as by the Monday the staff seemed to be new people, all very happy and eager to please. 
Overall I would stay again due to the quality of the hotel rooms however it could be alot better with a few minor improvements.
Positives
- clean stylish rooms
- live music
- beach area
- spacious and tidy pool area
- great breakfast

Negatives
- crazy expensive prices for food and drink. 
- mixed service from staff. Some very good some very slow.
- distance to any other bars/restuarants (although we knew this before we left so not complaining)
- having to ask for replacement water, teas and coffees in the room.
- awful DJ playing music until 1am which can be heard throughout hotel. Had to complain once.

"I would like to thanks all the staff of Sofotel Thalassa for their warm hospitality, their lovely smiles and respect they showed us. I had an excellent stay. 
Wonderful decoration , Amazing location . 
The room was clean calm with an amazing view. Everything was top notch. 

The gym was well equipped and one of the best that I have ever seen in hotels .the coach Isam  was super friendly And professional,  I had with him a fantastic training session of boxing and cardio that it's not easy to get at any hotel..

Thank you sofitel for everything. 

See you next year"
"This hotel was better than I expected. I came primarily for the fitness and spa and both were much better than I expected. All the staff were attentive and went out of their way to help. A special thank you to Issam Mouktahime who assisted me as my personal trainer for a few days. Very experienced and so helpful. I would thoroughly recommend anyone who is into fitness to ask for his assistance. Sofitel thank you ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
"Went to the gym ad the coach was excellent, helpful and enthusiast. Enjoyed my time there and will visit again. Also the spa was good. Also good service. Went there to enjoy my holidahs and the staff were very freindly"
"My partner and I are staying at the Thalassa Sea & Spa Hotel and have just speant the morning in the Spa.
We were looked after by Habiba and Hamina on the Spa reception who couldnt do enough for us, and we speant time in the beautiful pool before our treatments.
We booked in for a 25 mins Vichy Shower Massage which cost us 450 moroccan dirhams each (£36 GBP) and it was worth EVERY PENNY.
It was the best massage my and my partner had ever had!!! You lay on a bed while you are sprinkled with warm water all over your body while you are massaged with Vichy cream. 
It is so relaxing and you are in the same room together so you can enjoy the experience with eachother. 
A huge thank you to Samira Amhdar and Hanane!!!

Like the hotel, the spa is complete luxury and is constnatly cleaned and tidied, we absolutely loved every moment and will be booking in again before we go home!

THANK YOU - Habiba, Hamina, Samira Amhdar and Hanane!! Xxxx"
"It was a really good place to relax with friends specially at the So Beach. They have a great Hookah drinks are good beside the view front of the beach and you can see the famous mountain of Agadir oufla. 
I liked their gym and their coach Mr Issam he is a professional coach we had a great training session "
"Great thanks to the staff of the Thalassotherapy Institute for the perfect experience that I had with them there, mainly the wonderful manager Najia, the reception team Imane Habiba and Lamia for their efforts and hard working to achieve one main goal which is of course, satisfying  us. Many and much thanks to the perfect Spa therapists in the region of Agadir, professional, experts..people who really know the job and they do it as it should be done, thanks for your splendid massages..Nawal, Jazi, Samira, Fati, Hanane...

"Came here for a nice little break for my mrs with the kids  , once I got here  I was blown away with the service , hospitality & charector of the staff especially ABDUL LATIEF & colleague who all made my mrs birthday incredible. we've travelled vast luxurious places around the world using Sofitel, ME , W , hotel de Paris , HYAT, but this one person steered sofitel that much above everyone I've met on our travels ABDUL LATIEF a wizard with great personality & efficiency , SOFITEL should be PROUD to have you on their team , I hope on the next visit he is GENERAL MANAGER , we havnt checked out yet but Thank you very much in advance , Mohammed  ."
"I would like to send a special thanks to Imane, Lamia and Habiba for being so accommodating and welcoming during my visits to the spa. I felt so spoilt and pampered. The service was attentive and impeccable. 
Thanks to Essam as well for the work outs and tips on keeping fit. Hope to see you all next year."
"We spent one week in this ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Hotel. We arrived late at 1:30 am from Marakech. Welcome with tee and a form-fill-in. The room was nice and clean. The persons responsible for the rooms were very kind and always ready to help if we needed something like water or coffe-capsules. Room was always prepared with love. 

The service for the breakfast and the diner was at most 4 stars, rather 3 from my point of view. The problem aren‘t the waiters but rather the superiors. The service is insufficient organized, f.e. the waiters are not assigned to certain tables and therefore do not feel responsible for it. Table sets were not clean, knife fork and spoon were touched at the head when they were put on the table. The red wine was far to warm around 23 degrees instead of 18 to 19.

The service at the pool was far better. Moustapha was a excellent and attentiv waiter who cared like I expect it from a Fivestar Hotel.

But the far best area of the Hotel was the Spa and in particular the fitness So|Fit and his trainer and coach Issam Mouktahime. I very much apreciated his trainings of boxing, which were on a very high level. Thanks once again Issam! 5 stars ++

At the checkout we had problems with the debit of 2 massages and consumation of several beverages of the minibar which we never have had. A really bad experience at the end of a nice week we had at Sofitel. Really too bad that it ended unprofessional.

"I stayed in sofitel thalassa for a week. I had a room with a magnificent view on the beautiful gardens. The rooms were spacious and very clean. -The king sized bed was very comfortable and well taken care of by the house keeping service, will definitely come back for another vacation."
"The Consignor Hussain was very friendly and provide great customer service. He made the experience very memorable and me and my partner look forward to meeting him again when we book this luxury hotel. 

The clean Maryam was also very kind and their greeting was very warming."
"Myself and my boyfriend stayed here in June (apologies for the late review) after we saw pictures online of this hotel. We were slightly sceptical as we have been caught out in the past by misleading pictures, but this hotel is as beautiful as the pictures look! We couldn’t fault a thing the food was delicious, the facilities and decor were beautiful and as for the staff ... they were EXEMPLARY!!! Nothing was ever too much, they were all so friendly and polite, every single staff member we walked past acknowledged us from cleaners/gardeners to receptionists/managers. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and can’t wait to go back - perfect if you’re looking for a total chilled holiday by the beach whilst being well looked after ! 

Huge thank you to all the staff !! "
"My husband and I love this beautiful hotel. The staff are great and always look after us so well. A big thank you to Brahim, Lachen and F. Zaha. But a very special thank you to Yaccine who always makes us feel so very welcome."
"Had a fantastic 4 nights at the Hotel Sofitel with family.
Warm welcome on arrival from Mohammed (on probation- who hopefully achieved his diploma!)- with Moroccan tea and pastries. Hotel were able to honour our request for adjacent rooms.
Good sized rooms, with plenty of space.
Decor a little dated..

Buffet breakfast couldn’t be faulted... particularly loved the fresh juices..
Swimming area was lovely- thought the larger (non-heated) pool was bracing!
Beach front hotel- well maintained with beach volley ball too..
Only downside was that the hotel is situated at one end of a very long (7Km) sandy beach, so bit of a trek for food in evenings.
Would definitely recommend"
"This is a very good hotel, our room was excellent and we had the best sleep ever in a very good bed. Service was good, and the food in this hotel is absolutely amazing so good that we did not go outside for food , spa was very good. I will recommend this hotel to anyone "
"Great service and stay. 
I would definitely recommend this hotel. 

The only thing I would change is: initially book a room with breakfast as breakfast paid onsite is 220 DH per person per day, which is really good expensive. "
"For Morocco is this hotel a standard good hotel. Of course better than the nabour Sofitel hotel but it’s newer and more expensive. 
The beds are always fantastic in all the Sofitel hotels. It’s a pity that the a la carte restaurant for fish is only open at day time and the quality of the fish over there is not brilliant at all."
"Great resort with beautiful amenities, staff are very friendly and helpful, we got a free upgrade ocean front room.
My only remark, it will be better if they register the car license plate to the security agent at the main gate to avoid asking customers every single time for the reason coming to the resort. Beside that everything was outstanding."
"A special greeting to all softil members Agadir city for their efforts in making all my experience there wonderful extravaganza members having the best handle everything like reception etc and a special tribute to my friend Youssef and imane and issame  dearest member in that hotel and recommend everyone visiting will be fun there"
"We liked the place to rest after 4 hectic days in the Médina of Marrakech . The outside areas are fantastic. Not too crowded , nicely decorated. The staff is very friendly. The personal trainer Momo did a really good job helping us during fitness. He gave good advice during the work out.
The only downside : WiFi didn’t work.

"
"My boyfriend and I had such a horrible experience checking into a terrible hotel/resort that we immediately packed our things and booked Sofitel thelassa within 2 hours of arriving to Agadir. We were so lucky and grateful there was availability to accommodate our 1 week stay. My lover ended up proposing to me in our new hotel and the customer service has been impeccable here from start to finish. The staff here is loving and welcomes everyone as family. I work in the hotel industry and I will say they exceeded my expectations.  Faissal, Yousine, Said, Fouad, Nourdine, Idermi, Charlie, my hair dresser lol, and even guest relations-Younes. There was definitely way more staff that was helpful but unfortunately I didn’t get their names. The full service spa (hair, nails, massages, even a sea pool set at a warm temp), the outdoor pool, the rooms, the lobby area, the lounge were always kept clean. The place always smelled amazing. The decor so up to date. The food is great in this hotel BUT not many options which I guess is great because then that forces you to get out and enjoy the food at local restaurants that are less than 10min cab rides away and cheaper than in the resort. There is 24 hr room service for drinks and a limited food menu. Full Breakfast buffet is from 7:30am-10:30am (i believe), the full dinner buffet is open from 5:30p-10:30pm. There is a limited menu by the pool area, very comfy chairs and beds. There is also a lunch restaurant open from 12:30-5:30p close to the pool and overlooking the ocean.
If you want to get away from your crazy work and home life, I guarantee coming here will refresh you and make you feel like a king or queen! They legit cater to you, they don’t ever want to see you lift a finger. Naturally, since I work at a hotel, I am used to doing things for others so I found myself helping them help me lol but they always refused and said “no no. It’s ok. Sit down. Relax”. They speak French, Arabic, and English which is always a plus. Easy access to beach, there’s even a portion of the beach only accessible to guests but you do have to walk down towards the water.  It’s safe to leave your things where they are since it’s watched by hotel staff. I trusted everyone here and we will definitely come back... perhaps for our one year engagement anniversary ;) 
Oh one more thing, they have a sister hotel right next door and we also have access there for the bar, restaurant, and club night. 

Safe traveling!"
"We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights in June, which is low season. The hotel is a luxury hotel with a very large pool located at a very nice sandy beach. We had a nice room with pool & beach view. The room was clean and had a nice shower, good bed and a great large balcony. Staff was very friendly and helpful. The only negative issue was that you are not allowed to bring any food or drinks into the hotel and they will check bags to enforce the rule. We were not aware during booking or check in, so this was an unpleasant surprise the second day. The food and drinks in the hotel are good but overpriced. With many other restaurants nearby this was easily solved. The hotel, pool, pool towels etc. requires some minor  maintenance but nothing was so bad that it was concerning whether it could uphold the 5 stars. Being low season, the availability of seating at the pool and breakfast outside was more than adequate. Despite some very minor issues like difficulty to get a pool towel later in the day, we very much liked our stay and would recommend the hotel with the warning about bringing your own drinks into your room. Last but not least, a great thanks to the friendly guy at the gate (unfortunately forgot to write down his name, apologies for that). He had some great tips for sightseeing and shopping but foremost always made us feel very welcome every time we arrived at the hotel. "
"We visited in November 2016 only stayed for 2 nights due to the very expensive price - our room was very luxurious bed and shower back to back - the view wasnt as great it was supposed to be side sea view but was actually facing a pile of sand like a dune - breakfast was lovely lots to choose from - situated right on the private beach with beds and fancy huts - restaurant onsite we had lunch from there pizza was yum - all the people on reception were very helpful - hotel is very stylish loved loungin by the pool it also has sauna/spa facilities too - outside the hotel u have a line of taxi drivers so not hard - you can walk along the beach to mcdonalds/pizza hut etc but we went by taxi as i have mobility issues -   i would definitely recommend this hotel i just wish it wasnt as expensive!!"
"Hello my name is Thor from Iceland and im currently staying at the hotel at the moment with my girlfriend Eva, been here for 10 days. 

As many of you I went online before booking and read the reviews regarding Sofitel. Found mixed reviews and I wasn´t sure what to book but my girlfriend went ahead and booked while I was sleeping. 

Here at the Hotel we have had the best time, we are welcomed here as a part of the family. The staff is lovely and I must say that they give their best towards their clients.  I would reccomend when traveling to Morocco, come with and open heart and you will receive so much love instead. Smile and be curious, talk to the locals and get to know them. 

Yes the price of the Hotel is on the higher end and yes the drinks are not cheap. It´s the same price as in Iceland but the surroundings at the hotel are amazing and you really feel that the hotel is being well maintained for.  My girlfriend is loving all the aspect of the architecture of the hotel.

As this is written the Ramadan is on and the town of Agadir is much more  at ease. There is a saying that we Europeans have clocks, but Moroccon people have time. There is no rush and people tend to move on their own speed. 

Go for the breakfast at the Hotel, for my part it´s great. I´m welcomed by name and taken cared of. I saw so many reviews that people were complaining about the service, and the waiters forgot things. Stop whining, just ask the waiters again for a service. It can happen everywhere, even at 5 star Hotels. You are on a holliday, relax and take a surfboard lesson which is 20 meters from the Hotel. 

This hotel provides a good Zen experience, nice small gym and great spa treatments. If you would like to try out another vibe there is another Sofitel Hotel located beside this one. Nice hippie feeling to it and you can relax there during the daytime. 

I know many guys will be asking, is it possible to buy beer at the supermarket? It´s possible, just ask the taxi driver. There is a really good supermarket near the hotel, 3 minutes by taxi. (it´s not possible to by alcahol there)

I must give the breakfast staff 5 stars and the people at the front desk are amazing, if you need anything to be fixed they will help you or just strike up a conversation for no obvious reason, cool people. They even arranged for me to watch the Icelandic soccer team at my bedroom last night, sorry for the shouting though. 

Best regards to the hotel Sofitel and all the staff that has provided us with an awesome Morrocco Berber experience. 

Best regards from Thor and Eva. 

We will be returning again. ʾIn shāʾa llāh"
"Loved staying in this hotel. everything was clean and tidy with very friendly staff who were always happy to help. The pool area was lovely but unfortunately the beach was a bit of a mess due to bad winds

perfect hotel to go to if you want a nice relaxing holiday!"
"Our second time visiting Morocco at this time of year. We decided to try a different hotel.  We had high expectations when we realised that it was part of the Accorn/Sofitel chain. I will start with some good points:
-FOOD- the quality of food throughout the hotel was wonderful. Even though the breakfast and dinner restaurant (le market) was a buffet almost half the food was cooked to order. Lunch was also nice, although challenging at times with the sand blowing off of the beach and on to our table and food and drinks. We were very pleased in the food! Lovely!
-ROOM- we had two rooms for our family, two superior rooms. The decor was lovey and cleanliness was also good. The shower at times was not practical. The outside balcony area had ample space, a great sun trap! 
-STAFF-The waiters and waitresses in both the breakfast, lunch and dinner restaurants were very good (although sometimes forgetful!) however they were very polite. In particular Lahcen. The staff at the pool were all wonderful. They did everything for us, got drinks, organised sunbeds and got towels. Abdo looked after us at the pool most days, he was very kind and caring. One of the staff in the bar was also very kind.  More staff at this hotel should look to be more like Lahcen and Abdo. 

Some had points:
-MANAGMENT- throughout our five night stay it was made very clear that the management do absolutely nothing. Whilst the other staff are running round doing everything there are the mangers stood watching and having a chat. Only once did I see them doing anything useful. If you want anything done at this hotel DO NOT ASK ANYONE WEARING A SUIT!  
-CHECK IN- we arrived at the hotel a few hours before the standard check in due to the time of flight. We understood why the rooms were not ready as we were very early. However we were made to sit in the reception for an hour and a half without anyone telling us what was happening. In the end we went and found the Lunch restaurant. 

All in all, a great stay however they need new management and less of it! "
"We stayed for a week and had two what are classed as delux seaview rooms as there are no interconnecting rooms. The layout of our room was unusual with a shower in the middle of the room and separate toilet. The bathroom tiles and furniture are all dark and so it feels a bit closed in. I would have preferred the bathroom to be in a more traditional layout (did see these rooms). Also considering it’s a fairly new hotel the bathroom finish was a bit tired looking.  The bed was very comfortable and we had a decent sized balcony but it was never sunny on the balcony and quite windy so we didn’t use it.  I think what makes the hotel is the staff.  They are all so polite, helpful and friendly. The hotel reception, dining area, terrace and pool area are all lovely. The pool has beautiful cabanas around it and was heated at Easter. There’s a bar and very sumptuous sunbeds.  The beach is private and is sectioned off from the main beach and clean with fine sand. Although the hotel was 90% full we didn’t have any issues with getting beds by the pool and we had lunch by the pool each day and the salads etc were good and great service from Abdo.  As the buffet is 350 Dirham PP (bit steep we thought) as a family of 5, we ate out every night although we had room service one night which was quite good but the food was a bit tepid. The breakfast was good very lovely freshly squeezed orange juice but the selection the same every day. The guests were mainly French some English seemed regulars. The spa is a nice area but usually at the hotels I visit, just to have a swim, Hamam, sauna etc you don’t have to pay as a hotel guest but they charge, albeit £15.00 but I wasn’t sure why.  Would I return to Agidir? Probably not because there isn’t very much to do there and also at the hotel for children ours are 16, 13 and 11. I also wasn’t that struck by Agidir itself I prefer Marrakech. If the hotel was in a different area I would return. However if you are just after a week of relaxation it’s definitely good for this. 

"
"Excellent service. Breakfast buffet quite nice. Pool lovely. Private beach. Nice gym. Was there for a week with my gf in December. It was 19c and was able to lounge in the sun and swim too. Would recommend. Room was nice though a bit on the small side. There’s an open shower but private toilet. For a cheap 4.5 Star winter sun experience it’s recommended. Dinner buffets are very overpriced. It would seem to be the best option in Agadir.  "
"I currently stay in agadir for holidays, yesterday i walked past sofitel and went inside to gather some information about their spa, the receptionist (mehdi) welcomed me in a friendly manner and showed me around the spa area + explained the different available treatments. The Staff seems very trained and were able to answer all my questions. I planned a hamam and spa treatment for the coming week, the interior design is top notch, can only recommend this place, i saw different spas so far in agadir and this one seems to be one of the more luxurious ones. "
"This is a beautiful hotel, with a large pool and fantastic area for lying in the sun. Most of the staff are very helpful. Rooms are comfortable and our balcony had a lovely view of the palm-tree fringed pool and the sea. Service at the poolside was good. The buffet breakfast had a lot of choice including a good range of patisserie and pancakes, omlettes, hot choices and fruit. Thanks evening buffet was also good, and we enjoyed a meal in the fine dining restaurant which was expensive for what it was but in opulent surroundings and still nice. Downsides are that the hotel is the furthest away from the Marina so it is a long walk to other restaurants; and the bedroom lighting is not bright enough, more moody. That said you can get a taxi back from the Marina for less than five Euros so that's not a huge concern. A couple of evenings our room didn't get the turn down service which was irritating but not worth making a fuss about. I've no doubt that if I had called reception someone would have been up to our room with a couple of bottles of free water and a pillow chocolate in no time. The hairdryer was a bit pathetic and on a short curly lead so a but hard to use. Overall though it was a relaxing stay and I would definitely go back."
"Top class hotel with large rooms on a beautiful beach. Fabulous service from professional staff. Nice large pool with comfortable beds. Food quality and choice is excellent. Guests can share facilities with other Sofitel next door."
"Great hotel overall: stylish rooms, tasty food, awesome pool. The best thing was the beds around the pool with a shade coverage - great for people who can't be in the sun for a long time. 
Direct entrance to the beach.
The room service was not that good though, they forgot to refill the mini bar and didn't bring the change towels when I called the reception to ask them. 
The shisha and alcohol as well as spa in the hotel are over expensive comparing to the options in town so you might want to go out for those.
Beware, you can't bring your own alcohol to the hotel. But you can drink it at the beach ;)"
"top marks in all areas. professional and polite customer service, great location and a luxurious suite. backs straight on to a private beach. you can also use all the facilities of the sofitel next door.

Many Thanks"
"what makes this hotel extra especial is his staff and customer service. they were amazing dealing with small problems. my biggest thanks goes to kareem and maroua who served us with a great manner and made sure that we achieved what we were looking for in this holiday. we will diffenatly visit again"
"Very friendly staff all over. Very clean. Location is perfect for those who seeks peace & quietness during their vacation. Food & drinks prices very high compared to other equally standard restaurants. Rooms are small, bathrooms very very small. You can't call that a 5*. I have never seen that size of toilets, showers, hand wash. They are separately located. Specially the toilets are too small to sit with a locked door if you are a tall person. "
"This hotel is lovely. It is not very authentic Moroccan but more modern and chic. The pool is large and heated and has spacious day beds all around it. Perfect for families and couples- there were kids but all well behaved. The food is lovely- lots of choice/many restaurants- also have access to the other Sofitel next door which is less desirable in my opinion. Also the hotel is right on the beach! Unfortunately we had poor weather- lots of wind- but it was still nice for sunset views. 

The room was large and spacious. Lovely shower and all the amenities one would want. The staff is sweet and reactive- there were a few times our room was missing items and they happily fixed any issue with haste. 

Wi-Fi is very good, staff great, bar was fun with live music some nights and all around was just a lovely stay. My boyfriend and I recommend this place. 

My one complaint is the bed is two mattresses put together which I find cheap for an upscale hotel. They did have a mattress topper above it which was fine but I would have much preferred one mattress and for someone with a sensitive back this may be an issue. 

For reference, I stayed in a garden view hotel room 020. "
"I came with my wife and baby in March. Hotel excellent with friendly staff. whilst i spent my time near pool side Amine the swimming pool staff was ever so friendly and helpful. If you like to just unwind next to the pool or need any help he was always there to help. i defenatly experienced a 5 star service. "
"I stayed over few day for my bday with friends 5* treatment begun from the beginning ..  oujdam one of the reception staff made it possible as we had booked two rooms but they was meant to be twin  and one double she made sure we got our pool side room when room given was wrong. Was very polite and friendly .. also Fatima who worked main reception always made sure what ever time of day it was we had a smooth running with everything and the beautiful Ghiz pane . Pool staff was always great making sure breakfast was on time
And all needs were met "
"Arrived for a 3 night stay for our 20th wedding anniversary. 
Arrived in the evening, as we drove up the hotel was all lit up - and looked amazing! 
A porter came to meet us immediately and took our bags. We were seated in the lobby and given Moroccan tea whilst the reception checked us in. 

A few minutes later the porter got our bags and showed us around the hotel. He then took us to our room (a junior suite), WOW!! 
They had decorated the whole room with rose petals balloons and chocolates. 
Attention to detail was fabulous. 

Cleaners came twice a day - once to clean and once to do a turn down service. 
Products were supplied and all were Hermes - which I love. Slipper and robes were provided along with a little beach / pool bag. 

The Restaurant ... 
Breakfast- fresh juices- omelettes - fruits - pancakes - pastries - bread - homemade butters! Something for everyone. 

Dinner - different meats and fresh fish cooked to order every night. With several sides from salads to potato dauphinois. 
The deserts were beautiful. 

Service throughout the hotel was excellent.
The prices of drinks were quite expensive- which shocked me, as I thought Morocco would be cheap. 

The big question- would I return? 

Yes definitely- after walking up and down the marina and around Agadir - The Sofitel thalassa is by far the nicest hotel in Agadir. I wouldn’t want to stay anywhere else.

"
"We arrived at the hotel and the 5 star treatment began. We were escorted into the beautiful reception area and shown to a big comfy sofa where we were given Moroccan tea and some sweets while they checked us in.
We were then shown to our room which was amazing. We had a lovely view of the pool area. Our bed had rose petals on it and there was more sweets on the table which was a lovely welcome for our anniversary trip away. The door bell of our room rang and it was the man with our bags. 
The shower was lovely, It was in the middle of the room between to walls and had a glass door. The toilet was in a room on its own. There was a small walk in wardrobe that had an electronic safe in it which was great and easy to use.
The bed was like sleeping on a cloud. They changed it and the towels every day. All the staff were very helpful. 

There's a switch inside the door that turns the ""do not disturb"" light on. Remember to do this at night as on our first night a night porter rang our bell and knocked several times at ten to midnight to give me a box of tissues that I didn't need. It woke me but I should have turned on the do not disturb light.
The food in the buffet restaurant was beautiful. We went there for dinner the first night and really enjoyed it. There was plenty of selection of salad, hot and cold dishes and sides. There was even a section where they made fresh pizzas and pasta dishes to your liking. The desserts were our favourite. The chocolate moose was delicious. 
This is also where the breakfast was served. Again a huge selection of cereals, fruit, yoghurt and meat & cheeses. You could get omelets, crepes, pancakes & doughnuts made fresh. They brought fresh orange juice to your table and we fell in love with the morrocan tea which we had every morning.

On our last night we went to the other restaurant where we got soups to start that we're delicious and for mains we shared a shoulder of lamb which was one of the nicest dinners we've ever had and with a chef husband that's a compliment. All courses were dished out at the table and we were very well looked after.

The pool area was very clean apart from a few loose tiles it was perfect. The pool boys got you towels and turned the sun loungers towards the sun. You weren't expected to lift a finger in the hotel, everything was done for you. One morning the pool boy nearly dropped a a tray of drinks to help my husband who was turning a sunbed.

Over all we really enjoyed our stay, our only complaint was we didn't stay long enough. We'll definitely be back. "
"This really was a lovely hotel with excellent service; pleasant well-appointed rooms and in a great location at the best end of the beach - much quieter with fewer sellers on the beach than the more popular end near the centre.  The room was well-appointed and had a balcony that looked out over the pool area and towards the sea.
All the staff, and there were a lot of them so no waiting for service,  were extremely attentive and helpful   
The food at breakfast was delicious with lots of fresh fruit and both cold and hot choices.  We only ate in the a la carte Moroccan restaurant once but the food there was equally as good. 
Some of the reviews mentioned broken tiles in the pool area.  Well, these have either been repaired or people seemed to be hypersensitive about the odd crack or two....it really wasn't a problem .  There is another Sofitel next door, but although this was very pleasant, there was a clear step up in terms of luxury between that hotel and the Thalassa .  We thoroughly enjoyed our short stay and would recommend this hotel to anyone who like us was looking for a relaxing break from the cold winter here in UK. "
"Stayed in this lovely hotel for 3 nights. We were upgraded to a suite which was magnificent.. huge bed, great bathroom with enormous bath and luxury Hermes toiletries.
The staff at the hotels were truly wonderful from the moment we walked in. Zaccaria from concierge couldn't have been kinder and so helpful. Fatima at reception was so efficient and Omar in the restaurant was wonderful. 
I would highly recommend this hotel! 
Hopefully we will be back next year ! "
"My wife and I spent a week in this hotel in Jan/Feb 2018 and I have difficulty thinking of anything negative.
The location is ideal as it is situated at the very end of the bay away from the busier part but is still connected to the paved promenade that runs the length of the bay to the marina at the other end. A taxi to a restaurant in the centre was around £5 including the tip!
Although nicely decorated and well appointed, the hotel is sophisticated without being either pretentious or intimidating. All of the staff were absolutely charming and nothing was too much trouble to make the stay pleasurable. The attendants around the pool area were fantastic and I would make special mention of Said who went out of his way to anticipate our every need.
Our room was excellent. It was light, airy, very comfortable and had everything that we needed as well as being well serviced.
Breakfast and dinner offered very extensive choice and, although described as 'buffet' in the Market Restaurant, many of the dishes were freshly cooked to order. We normally avoid buffet style dining but in this case the quality was at a different level.
Wine and other drinks were more expensive than normal but that is to be expected in  hotels.
All in all, a first class hotel that we would definitely return to if visiting Agadir again."
"The Sofitel did not disappoint, the service was excellent, very clean, we left very happy and very relaxed, the week went too quickly , I think the bar area inside could do with a revamp, it was boring, it needs life to keep the guests there, breakfast was superb, everything fresh. The staff very friendly, and always ready to help. Probably the pool needs a look at, for a 5star to have tiles coming off in so many parts of the pool???? Still I would gladly go back today for another week or two."
"We visited Agadir in January, the Sofitel Thalassa hotel is worth visiting. Staff is very nice and helpful, very hard working. The hotel is beautiful and spacious. If you want a relaxing and pampered holiday, that's the place to go. In January the place wasn't very crowded, plenty of room at the pool. There was live music in the evening in the bar, but rather empty. I think it is because of the overpriced drinks, we paid £16 for a pint of beer and a glass of wine. Food was nice and lots to choose from. I would definitely return to this hotel."
"We visited in early January. The hotel is beautiful, lovely private beach, access to miles of perfect beach. The staff are courteous and helpful. All lovely.
It seems very family friendly which is great if that’s what you’re looking for. We weren’t! We are past that stage. Our fault for not doing the research beforehand! 
Having said that, we had an enjoyable stay."
"I visited Morroco on the 1/01/2018 and stayed at the Sofitel Agadir Thalassa Sea And Spa only one word to describe the hotel WOW. From the moment our transfer drove towards the entrance I fell in love. The place is beautiful, the staff were friendly we had a nice room on the ground floor with a balcony and terrace. The place was AMAZING. The pool, the sofas and beds to lie on were so cosy I can not fault nothing atall about this hotel. If you are visiting Agadir you MUST stay here you will not be disappointed. I did not want to leave wow what a beautiful place."
"Had another great stay at Sofitel Agadir. Best hotel in the world!!!....Special thanks to Said from the pool area who has really looked after us during our stay. Look forward to our next stay here.

👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😁😁😁😎

"This hotel is lovely. If you are after relaxation and simplicity then this is perfect!

The hotel is situated at the very end of the beach development and is lovely and peaceful. 

We booked a room with side view of the sea but our first room view was obscured by trees which after a little reluctance they agreed to move our room.

The hotel is very overpriced for food and drink-like many of the reviews say. In the evenings we would walk along the beach/promenade and have drink in a little bar and watch the sunset-drinks are half the price!!

The grounds are maintained by an army of staff and everyone is very friendly.

The pool is a fantastic size. It need a bit of tlc on the tiles but the beds and loungers are lovely and all the pool boys were friendly and kind.

The food is good. Breakfast is fab!!

We didn’t use the spa, which is extremely unusual for us, on the grounds of the staff being rude. We normally waste lots of time in spas but were reluctant to have to interact with the staff there which was a great shame. 

I would highly recommend this hotel. "
"Location 

The Sofitel Acadir Thalassa sea is located on Agadia beach right where all the main 5 star hotel resorts are. From airport it takes 30-45 minutes depending on time of day. Hotel provided car so unsure on how much it costs. 
It’s a nice location right on the beach quite a wide beach with some rough sea since Atlantic Ocean comes in but nonetheless nice & clean. 
Within area is a beach promenade with some restaurants, bars & main area of Agadia is less than 5 minutes drive away. 

Room - Prestige suite 

The room was a nice spacious room with an interesting design of both cozines & modern Moroccan style decor from traditional lighting lamps. Colourful furniture with a marble corridor & various in room amenities that meet the expected standard of a 5 star suite at a boutique beach resort. 
The bedroom offers the super comfortable signature Sofitel bedding. One of the most comfortable beds in the industry. Huge size with a large lamp shades either side & in addition long leather  covered flexible reading spot light either side along with plug sockets though non local do non - euro guests bring plug adaptors. 
The room faces a small TV that is suitable for distance to bed but an odd slide-able wooden shutter is offered to close TV view - presumably for privacy of those worried about TV recording you, though TV is not Samsung. 
Either side of bedroom are white cosy curtain drapes creating ambience & to close of room from living room. 
For clothes and bag storage there is a whole other wooden room adjoining bedroom with wardrobe containing laptop safe, slippers & comfy thick towel gown. 
The toilet faces entrance in a non obvious wooden door for privacy. 
Between room and bathroom that leads to living room is marble arches walkway with bathroom on one side.
Here your will find slate cut double sinks, huge bath for 2 & in addition a large marble shower cubicle for 3 with a seat inside offering a overhead shower with lighting function (though was out of batteries) & also a separate shower head on cord. 
Premium amenities include Hermes orange scent branded bottles of shower gel, shampoo, conditioner & body lotion.   Plenty of branded soaps as well.  Though weirdly no toothbrush but you can request via reception. Also strange is lack of bathroom bottled water of which one expects at this standard of room.
The open living room next door has a cosy Moroccan colourful L shaped sofa seating area for 5 at end with coffee table facing a large TV at end. This is accompanied with full Bose sound system set up with remote- one for TV with sub & other for music. Making a sort of cinema standard quality minus the seats experience. 
Also is large fridge mini bar, Nesespresso machine with 8 pods, as well as kettle. 2 little glass water bottle is complimentary. 
Near the TV is a large dining table for two. The decor is lovely in this room with authentic Moroccan lamps & art work. It’s very cosy spot to relax from the warm lighting design. 
There is also an exterior large patio outside two double glass doors offering a fantastic view of the pool & sea in distance. Great patio space with one double mattress at one end with plenty of pillows at one end & another small single at other end.  Nice pillows to chill & listen to sea. At night warm chilled Souk style lanterns contribute to the mellow ambience. 
Overall the room is expensive but it’s a nice experience to have the option to chill in room & relax outside with privacy & great view throughly enjoyed the super comfortable bath, nice bath & the overall ambience. 
There are some things that could be improved though such as all literature regarding SPA is in French only. I couldn’t find an official hotel guide , other than the map of the resort facilities given at reception also in French. They should have dental kits in room & bottled water to brush ones teeth, though they do include one large bottle at mini bar of which is more for drinking. Some maintenance issues as well with the shower lighting unit running out of power of which I had to call facilities to fix. In addition no usb sockets or international plugs of which all other Sofitel I have stayed at have offered. Considering it is also a beach hotel suite it was odd not to see hotel flip flops on offer that one sees in most beach resorts in Asia like Shangri La even in standard room. 

Facilities 

The hotel offers decent WIFI without password throughout hotel & worked well. 
Catering options include a large restaurant of which breakfast is served and was comprenshive offering with expected high standard of food- lots of healthy juices as well. I did not use restaurant or bar but bar certainly is artistic and has live music each night. I did order a burger for room service & it was delicious with fast service 
Other options include a Moroccan authentic restaurant, a sea restaurant with gourmet cuisine plus a pool lounge bar. 
Leisure options include a large pool but as others have said it is sad to see obvious bad repair work with the pool cement tiles making it look like a dated hotel of which it is not. There are however a lot of sun loungers, large round outdoor sofas & cabana surrounding the pool area. They sort of have a secure beach area also with plenty of seats & bathing items.
There is also a large modern gym & I did notice some yoga classes available at certain times during the day. Also a very high end of spa but did not use with focus on local products like Argon oil. 
In terms of decor of hotel public area it is impressive if your a modern edgy art fan, lobby lounge corridors all offer a splendid display of interesting art and decor that matches a high end boutique Miami hotel & art reminded me of the Pullman in Jakarta. 
I did also see a large room with huge projector TV and very comfy sofas assume for Movie nights. Also a life size chess set. 
There is a huge patio with seating that has an scenic view of the huge pool area & beyond that the sea. 
There is a sister Sofitel hotel next door that also has a nice lounge club with DJ, 5 restaurants & spa etc - so plenty of options there. Plus those with kids have an activities centres designed for them. 

Staff

The drivers at the hotel are really nice & friendly. Reception also meeting the highest standard escorting you to room to explain everything. 
However other outlets could do with being better trained. Maintenance guy shrugged his shoulders when asked if he had any batteries to repair the shower lighting. Getting Restaurant staff to give you a coffee seemed to take longer than it should they are not very proactive. All of which is not 5 star standard that Sofitel is known for. Overall Sofitel Casablanca has better staff service but the room is far better at this resort. 

However really enjoyed my stay all based on room & there deserve 5 stars for that but the management should consider training staff to be more 5 star proactive effort plus address some of the scrapes and damage to some areas of pool and other outlets. However loved this hotel & would come again."
"It took me a long while to decide on a place to stay, and I am glad I chose this hotel as it was my first time in Morocco. 

I had looked through numerous photos before booking and I have to say I was more overwhelmed being there. 

The grounds are beautiful, there is loads of fun art around, we had buffet breakfast and dinner at the market, which is the hotel’s restaurant and the staff and service was absolutely wonderful. 

The room I got had a Terrace that leads directly to the pool and beach area which is beautiful and also offers a view of the mountains.

Overall, it was totally worth it and I’m glad I made the choice "
"Warm pool, very hospitable staff specialy Mr Mehdi the physiotherapist who was around on every service and details needed and a panoramic view on the sidewalk given by this charming city. I guess there is no other place to be at after a stressful week working in my opinion since i've been in so many places due to my job requirement.
Thank you for this great day, see you soon Mr Mehdi, Ahmed and Youssef."
"Just finished 3 wonderful nights in this hotel, there is nothing bad that I could say ,from check in till leaving all amazing.service from mourad by the pool was impeccable. The check in staff at the desk again fantastic. The check out staff fantastic. I don't usually write reviews but based on some of the reviews I read before coming left me a bit anxious but no need. Good selection of food if u have an option go half board. Breakfast good selection. The price for food and drinks is expected for 5*. Thoroughly enjoyed my stay. Greeted with a smile and good morning every day. Rooms clean,new bed sheets and towels changed. I loved the 2 way mirror for the shower , nice touch. Decor is very modern. If you want traditional this is not the hotel for you.10/10 :-) "
"Had a wonderful stay.  This was our 3rd time.  Breakfast and dinner buffet excellent. 
Staff were very good by the pool. 
Used the spa several times. 
Ahmed does an excellent massage.
Will definitely be returning. "
"Beautiful hotel. it was very welcoming and super friendly. My friends and I enjoyed staying at the beautiful rooms and mostly the facility. The Spa was relaxing. The views are amazing. I would definitely plan to go back again"
"I want to thank Mr. Yassine the concierge that tended to our client Mr. L in such a professional and prompt matter. 
A big thank you to the whole team and especially Mr. Yassine for his kind assistance. 

Great job to the Sofitel Thalassa."
"Beautiful hotel. Great service. I went to spend time in the fitness centre and spa. The service was wonderful. Issam Mouktahime is the personal trainer in the gym there and was so helpful. I would thoroughly recommend his services to friends and family in the future. More than helpful and knowledgeable. 5 stars 
"
"One week holiday could not fault the service and I am a hotel manager for Hilton International.  Food served was of a high class, (pay for what you get!)  All the staff were warm and helpful, Breakfast would be one area to improve the service, stop the staff talking to each other and serve the customers.  Breakfast is important.  But the kitchen staff and chefs on show put themselves out for each guest.  Well done to the Operation Manager who we met on our last day.  Yes I said I would send a review!"
"Me and my partner absolutely enjoyed every moment of our stay in Sofitel. A special thank you to all the staff including the cleaners and most importantly we would like to thank Amine and Faisal for taking good care of us. Both very wonderful people providing us with great hospitality services. Thank you, and we hope to see you soon. Love, from the latte and tropical juice couple"
"We have been staying at this property for the third year in a row and will book again for November this year. Temperature is always great and warm, outside pool is heated and huge, direct access to the beach makes a difference since the promenade has been built. Breakfast is really nice but ridiculously expensive (20 euros per person) anywhere else in the city a local typical Moroccan breakfast will cost 50dhms maximum (5 euros). Overall, food and beverage are too expensive for the destination. Staff is always nice and great with kids, we have a young daughter and they saw her growing years after years. She feels great there and the place is safe and secure. Dinner at the property is boring. The buffet is 40 euros pp (again ridiculously expensive) and often showcase the same type of food although they label it differently Lebanese, Moroccan, Mediterranean etc... same flavors every night. Also still don't understand why the fish restaurant which is right at the Beach and boasts a beautiful roof terrace, is closed in the evenings...big disappointment. The best experience is with no doubt the gastronomic restaurant with real and exquisite Moroccan dishes. Unfortunately often empty or not busy enough to create an atmosphere. Rooms are great, gym, spa, view, staff, we love it there. A special comment about the kids club which is located at the second Sofitel (next door), the staff is great with kids, friendly, creative, very flexible and always available even outside of the holiday season. Although I believe F&B is waayyyyy too expensive compared to any other hotel in Agadir, we will save some money and book it again. Location is amazing, staff super friendly and the place extremely quiet which is what we are looking for."
"I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough | food excellent | service exceptional | pools well maintained | 9 Km adjacent beach perfect for walking 

Make a point of making contact with the Poolside Staff  | Abdel | Amine | Said | who will take the very best care of you 

Also in hotel reception | Houcine the Bellboy | Karin the Shift Leader | were there to greet us on arrival with mint tea and local pastries and were there to wave goodbye 2 weeks later"
"We spent an unforgettable week at this wonderful hotel with a great pool and beach area. The food (breakfast and dinner buffet) was delicious and offered a various choice including live cooking stations. We were deeply impressed and pleased how friendly we were treated by the staff. Every single employee was very friendly, helpful and always smiling. 
Please keep on going like this. You are all great and unique!
Hope to see you again, inshallah. 
If you love to be pampered by great people go there and check it out 😀
"
"Looked after superbly from arriving to departing, nothing too much trouble.
Love the hotel,great grounds,pool, beach and some really good restaurants in Agadir. Special mention to concierge Mohammed and Amine who looked after us around the pool."
"BAD POINTS: 
The hotel looks  tired,  there is a lot of wear and tear everywhere , it seems replacing or properly fixing completely worn out , damaged, stained or broken items is not  standard routine in this property. I did not expect to see this in a 5 * star hotel.I have  been to other Sofitels and they were very well maintained but not this one.  It is clear that little attention to detail is paid when it comes to any maintenance ,  from broken tiles around the hotel,  to piles of sown timber holding up the wall hang toilet in our bathroom ( which was also fitted at incorrect height and extremely uncomfortable to use, feet can't touch the floor unless you are a basketball player) , towel rail in bathroom with smashed wall bracket, to some  worn out/torn  pillow cases and bathrobes that should have  gone in the bin but are still being put in  the rooms, stained covers on majority of sun loungers, bird droppings on balcony  cushions,  torn covers on cabana cushions , abandoned broken cabana on the hotel beach  area with no mattress that stood there like that during our entire stay, rusty fixtures... the list goes on.  If you are used  to or  expect to see  everything perfectly finished , maintained or  presented  this isn't the hotel.  Bear in mind  you will still pay 5 * prices. 
Spa access is to be paid for. This was not clear anywhere at the point of  booking , not even on the  hotel's own  website. Cost to access a steam room and pool 200MAD! for hotel guests?! This really isn't what one would expect . 
If your diet consist of a high percentage of fresh vegetables or you are vegetarian or vegan  you will not find adequate food to eat at the buffet, only a  small selection and little variety of fresh vegetables is what is available which again I do not think it is adequate in  a 5 * hotel buffet.
A lot of noise throughout the day audible in our room from cleaners in nearby rooms dragging furniture  at random  throughout the day , this made it impossible to have   nap during the day. Bearing in mind  hotel  cost us the  average  GBP  330 per day   this wasn';t reasonable, you are on vacation  and can't even rest when  you want to.  I did complain but  the noise continued.The guest relation manager gave us a little gift on departure to say sorry but  I must say that does not make up  for  intermittent noise from 9.15 am to 6 pm every day whilst paying expensively daily for a room.
GOOD POINTS
If you have any specific need or are unhappy with anything and ask for what you need the staff will try their  best to accomodate your request  which for me made all  the difference.
The main restaurant manager and hotel Chef Yusef   made sure I had at every meal all the vegetables I needed . I really appreciated their efforts, thank you. 
To make up for the  disastrous weather during almost our entire stay (which ruined our holiday)  the Spa manager kindly offered free spa and sauna access  for us. I really appreciated the thought. This has a sea  water pool  whereas the external  pool contains chlorine  (for me a problem) 
At the spa , which is  large , very nice  and spotless,  we  had a  good massage by the physiotherapist Mehdi.  He was knowledgeable  professional and  pleasant.  Would highly recommend.
On the day of departure we were offered  a  late check out, our flight was late at night so  I was very pleased we could enjoy the day comfortably and have a civilized dinner before departure. 
The hotel is generally very comfortable and  it has direct access to the beach, large pool and lots of spaces to lounge around. The decor is tasteful, no expensive finishes anywhere, but still pleasant enough . The staff are all very nice and helpful. With nice weather  I m sure one can have a  nice  holiday here.  Overall I would return provided I got a room with no daily noise and if the weather was sunny"
"Me and my hubby stayed the first week of this month for a week.
We do travel a lot for long or short holidays but as it was our first visit to Agadir I've tried very hard to find a right hotel for us to be able to relax and have a compleat tranquility and I've made right choice.

We are not a sun worshippers but as we live in London wouldn't mind to see nice sun :) however it was our bad luck that the weather was very clouded and probably seen the sun only for a few hours in whole week (apparently it does happens in the beginning of September) and it was local holiday period therefore most of shops and restaurants were closed for few days.

Now about the hotel itself, if I want to compare the facilities, room amenities and general conditions with other 5* hotels from around world we've stayed I can go on a bit. 
But hey, who really cares about a little bits and pieces, lime scale in the coffee machine and a little blockage of the basin will not ruin my holiday.

Important thing is we enjoyed our break without doing much and we felt that hotel personnel made our holiday, they are very friendly professional hard workers doing absolutely their best with a big smile.

I don't normally do this but I have to list their names to encourage their work.
Reception - Karim, Asma, Yassin 
Pool - Frank, Radwan, Michael
Restaurant - Adil, Ibrhim, Yassin, Rachid 
Finally special thanks to Mr. Alla El-din and Mr. Othman.

Thank you guys and hope to see you soon.

"We stayed at the hotel in early July and had a wonderful time there for 2 nights.  We were travelling in Morocco for my wife's birthday and the staff upgraded our room (guest of the day !).  Noura and Katia helped to plan a wonderful birthday dinner by the beach.  The hotel is beautiful, the rooms are very nice and elegant and all of the staff were very helpful.  Thank you Noura and Katia would a wonderful experience !!!"
"Stay here quite often but this time they laid on a very special private dinner. It was on the roof with gorgeous views of the setting sun over the ocean
Private chef to BBQ oysters turbot sardines and prawns. If you've never tried BBQ oysters you must , slightly smokey , delice. Turbot just Pink at bone perfect
All the team came with bday cake , which could hardly manage but superb next morning for fast 
All this is thanks to their new manager who is going to shake the place up and put it where it should be , at the top
This is the only hotel in Agadir with direct access to the beach and the sea seems to be always warm, we have swum in April and November 
All the staff try very hard and it would be unfair to single anyone out 
Trust me for a beach break it is difficult todo better and only just over 3 hours from most European cities"
"We stayed here for 5 nights and all I can say is the food, service and decor is exceptional. This hotel really does care about quality.

I have stayed in the top hotels around the world and this was in the top. 

If you go agadir stay here. "
"We recently stayed at the Sofitel and it was amazing. We really enjoyed our stay at that property. A big thanks goes to Abdullah, Frank and Hamza the Waiter from the Pool. All 3 did an amazing job and could not do their work better than they did. It was just wonderful. We also have to tell a big thanks to Pascha the Concierge and Houcine the Bellboy they  took really good care of us during the whole stay and on our depart date when you pick up service did not arrived. Otherwise the entire team from the Spa were just terrific. They all were really nice and had an awesome knowledge of everything concerning the spa. On one day we had some problems with the breakfast and the SO Club at the other Sofitel Property but that problem was managed by Sebastian the Operations Manager in a really good way. We felt understood and he personally ask us every day if everything is okay now and if we were happy. Big thank you for such an Service. Thats what makes the difference staying in a property like Sofitel. We will defenetly come back !!!!!"
"Our stay at this hotel was excellent. We were greeted with Moroccan tea & a cool washcloth when we arrived and after a short while were shown to our rooms. One of us had a beautiful suite on the 3rd floor which had a fantastic view of the Atlantic Ocean.
All our needs were met from the restaurant which offered buffet bkfast & dinner to recommendations for tours to various souks, as well as, overnight tours to the Sahara.
Thank-you Mohammed, our concierge, for all recommendations & support in many local matters. The young men around the pool worked extremely hard making sure we were comfortable in our cabanas while the Spa offered quite nice services. We took advantage of the facial treatment, which also allowed us to enjoy the seawater pool and jacuzzi for the day. All in all, everyone at this Sofitel Agadir Thaleesa Sea & Spa work very hard to keep their hotel in good running order and everyone happy. Looking forward to returning one day."
"Very nice hotel , lovely staff and prestige suite is the best and very spacious. The only thing I was not happy with was the restaurant inside the hotel called the market as we paid £35 for the buffet and the food was not nice and made me very ill. The decor of the rooms is great and they are also sound proof. The man that works in the parking area at the front checking cars and room numbers for security is lovely and very helpful and an asset to the hotel. 

"
"I done many hotel in the world but I never had great vacations  like in Sofitel  Thalassa . It's the perfect place for family, special thanks  to Fatima manager assistant in the Buffet chef Samir chef habiba rachid and Yacine ,"
"Best hotel in Agadir great pool and beach amazing reception staff specially ABDUL he really helped me out and I advice try to get pool view  as all room has balcony you will enjoy it and spa is nice many supervise all over the hotel to insure customer satisfaction "
"Stay at Sofitel for a 7days, hotel concierge arranged their hotel taxi to collect me and family from airport. Arrived at airport with welcoming drinks and fresh face towels, requested for an early check in and that was done smoothly without any quibbling. Stayed in the prestige room was expecting more for the price payed per night but the the consistent service and overall hotel decor was outstanding. Food was ok in general but the tagine and lobster meals were mind blowing. Mehdi the physiotherapist who gave me an outstanding massage and relaxing time probably the best massage I've had. 
Ghizlaine from guest relation made our 6th year wedding anniversary mesmerising she went out her way and really made it special, had private dinner at beach, music was fantastic. I really can't remember everyone's name but every single staff and team at Sofitel were superb and delivered excellence. Room 119, stayed between 20-27th July. Ali, Shamimara and Musa "
"We spend 12 days in the sofitel spa agadir 
The service and quality were more the excellent 
Our compliments to the manager who has  created a perfect team spirit !!!

The food is excellent with a team that takes care of every detail !

Excellent room service

Perfect turndown service early evenings

Pool attendends are very friendly and helpful

"We had a week here 4/11 February  (can't  believe I never sent this before just found in drafts!) . On arrival (with mint tea and macaroons) we were upgraded to 159 ... what a treat. It was lovely  and simply  huge.  Our whole stay was made by the lovely friendly staff ... nothing was too much trouble. At breakfast (which was absolutely beautiful) within 2 days our orange juice and black tea arrived automatically  as soon as we came in. The weather was mixed and the hotel was not full so it was a really relaxing break.  The hotel visually is decidedly quirky very black and white with some seriously curious artwork  (you're never going to be bored!) The staff definitely are the best I've met in a long while even ordered me a taxi to a local pharmacy ( 😂 forgot plasters and got a blister walking up to the Marina on day 1 !) and arranged for him to wait to bring me back. Only ate in restaurant once and had room service once - both times were excellent.  Had some snack lunches and drinks by the pool which were very good. Looking forward to coming back again in the autumn. "
"This is the first time we come to Agadir or even Morocco to celebrate my birthday. First we received a warm welcome from Mahdi, who trains in the reception and we had a problem that we put the bags at the airport and he helped us to restore. And whenever we met him ask us how we are and ask us if we need something. And the thing I loved and influenced in that he brought me a cake on my birthday, accompanied by a bouquet of roses.
 I told him that I would come in August and suggested that I visit Opera suite, which is the biggest suite in the hotel but I did not have time for it. He suggested that he go himself and send me a video of the pavilion and I agreed with pleasure. From this platform I liked the pavilion And will book it next time. I like the hotel and I also like how to deal with customers and I hope to come again.
 Finally thanks to all the staff and special thanks to Mehdi for the video  😉 and for your hospitality, see you again. 
I am sorry for my method in English 😊"
"Amazing hotel, impeccable service throughout from abdul Latif at front desk, jamal at breakfast, khadija for house keepin , amine at poolside and the little cleaner that kept the whole complex spotless
Looking forward to attending again very soon. Thank u sofitel"
"The customer service was amazing, Said Bouachraoui took very good care of us.  He and his staff was very attentive to our every need.. I am excited to return to this hotel on my next visit....Everything from the food to the pool was amazing."
"Excellent location, excellent hotel, excellent reception, excellent staff (with special thanks to Moustapha), excellent dining, excellent pool and sun area, excellent live music by Kevin and Sandra... they are wonderfull, every night !...
This vacation was heaven on earth : SJOEKRAN !"
"The property is well maintained, we had a very nice room, great beds, lots of amenities in the room (Hermes toiletry), fresh water bottles, expresso machine..
Beautiful pool with plenty of lounge chairs and towels. Staff was always pleasant and smiling. Breakfast is plentiful, but beware of lunches. There is only one restaurant for lunch (The Atlantic) with no other option than a salad bar and a grill. You can't order A La Carte (except sandwich), so be ready to get the same salads and grill pieces of fish or sausage every day of your stay.
Moroccan dinner at Le Palais du Jardin was very nice. 
We tried the Moroccan Nights at Sofitel Royal Bay Resort, a disaster..very loud music we waited 45' for the appetizer and decided to move to the other restaurant La Nasse..even worse we waited over one hour for our course even though the restaurant was empty. The waiter apologized and explained that their Chef was sick at home. When we finally got our food it was blend and not tasty, I could not eat the food. The waiter apologized again and told us that the food would not be charged to our room...and of course I found the charge on my bill when I checked out. 
For dinner definitely try Villa Blanche next door, superb atmosphere and great food. Reservation is a must. You should also try Pure Passion in the Marina.
I would definitely recommend the Sofitel for the quality of the rooms, the kindness of the staff, the lunch food (except breakfast) is not that good nor diverse."
"We have not been in a peak period so everything was easy.. Breakfast variety was excellent. The quality was variable. Moreover, there was an army serving the tables but there were delays in taking orders or watching for signals - everybody looked busy.

Otherwise all staff were very well trained and always keen to help. Their response time to our needs or requests was commendable.

The room was comfortable and well designed. The swimming pool was nice and the general architecture and set up was very beautiful.

The hammam was also rather 'cold' and does not qualify as such. When we inquired the reply was that guests did not sustain too much heat and humidity.. Please do not advertise it as hammam. The massage was OK but not memorable."
"Stayed in a junior suite. Very well designed room with sitting room, bedroom, large bathroom and balcony. View over the pool to the sea. Loved the space. Breakfast was great if a bit pricey at €22 each. Fresh fruit, juices, good selection of French baked goods, eggs. Staff were initially very attentive but that seemed to drop off towards the end of the visit, maybe we didn't get the tipping right! Overall a lovely hotel in a nice quiet location. Really enjoyed walking down the beach into town (about 1 hour). "
"Very good Service all over the hotel. One Hotel manager called Ahmad Bahbah was taking care of anything we needed. Awsome man!! The food was also very nice. The only Thing that we didbt like was the small gym. The beach therefore was a dream!!! "
"Went there for a short business stay in February. The weather was quite chilly at night. Should be very nice during summer. The hotel is very nice. It has a very huge open area for the pool and connected to the beach. Room are okay, little bit small compare to the total hotel area, i mean they can build the hotel with bigger rooms from the beginning. Staff are polite and friendly. Dinner buffet at the International food restaurant was delicious."
"The stay here was really outstanding. From check in to the rooms, bed well laid out and rooms well set up. Puts you in a calm state of mind. 
Corridors very traditional and royal, you would just love the long walk to the lift especially with the break away doors to see the pool and Beach Front. 

Advice: try using the emergency exits if it's in front of your rooms. It leads faster to the restaurants through the pool side. 

It gets really breezy and cold at night so your best bet is to swim in the day. 

The Beach Front is calm and quiet. You really would get some inspiration here. 

And oh yeah, the food it great, try the eggs outside the restaurant in the morning at breakfast. 

"
"Beautiful resort. I spent three days in a large suite which is really impressive : designed with modern sensitivity but allowing the feeling of Moroccan culture. All the luxury of Sofitel with the French cousu main. Aladin, the GM and his team, can make your dreams come true. The funny thing is that you can go from the Sofitel Thalassa to the Sofitel Royal Bay in 5 mns. Enjoy 2 different moods the same day!"
"Big hotel, resort style
Three restaurants, bar and spa
Spa is the biggest attraction, nice but not too traditional 
Nice and spacious rooms and good bedding 
Could pay a bit more attention to detail, housekeeping and cleaningness
Breakfast buffet nice with a local touch
Dinner buffet also 
Personnel could be more efficient- too many people going up and down uncoordinated 
That said, they were all very willing, polite, accommodating and smiling 
Confortable beach and seaside setup 
Good value for money 
I would definitely recommend it as a holiday destination 
Stay away from pick perods"
"We had such a beautiful stay here. It's truth that check in was a bit hush we had to wait quit a long time due to us not having confirmation email from booking however the stay has been prepaid and they did had us on system so this was a bit weird. Not sure what happened there....

Our bedroom was stunning from bed to balcony and shower just perfectly design would recommend this beauty and relax to everybody.

Service was excellent, hotel provides everything you can think off even a midnight cleaning of bedroom.

We tried one morning their buffet breakfast and it was amazing. All food was fresh + plus fresh squeezed kiwi, strawberry, cucumber etc. Juices. However even if the breakfast was amazing price of 200dirham .... I was questioning.

But still Perfect place in Agadir

Btw if you can't afford to stay here whole stay then split your stay to be here at least 3 days .... It's worth it :) you won't regret "
"Thank you so much guys we had the best time. Everyone was so friendly helpful and kind from mehdi in the reception to amine at the pool. We are coming back to this diamond in agadir for sure thx all of you Abdelkarim, big boss Ayoub ,Hassan   Great staff great hotel ❤👍🏼
Casper and Lukas "
"We booked a junior suite, having been upgraded to a superior suite at our previous stay.  The fact that we went back indicates how much we enjoyed our stay.  This visit didn't disappoint.  While the junior suite was not as luxurious as the superior, it was spacious, clean had every amenity we could wish for and a superbly comfortable king size bed.  Separate toilet.  Bath, wet room power-shower huge balcony with two double sized beds to laze around on and a fantastic ocean view where we watched the sun set every evening.  Separate living area with two large flat screen tv's - one in the bedroom.

The location is great, with it's own private beach and at the end of a beach walkway which leads to the port with shops and restaurants along the way.

Don't forget to put a day aside to visit the Souk - a short taxi ride away."
"We enjoyed a great stay and espicially very special dinner in this hotel. The food was splendid, we made our compliments to the master chef Jean Marie Gueraisch and he came to our table to thank us. Again greaat stay and definteley recommend the restaurant."
"Overall good experience, fantastic location by the beach. I had a very relaxing massage by Majda at the spa, thanks. I would definitely choose this hotel again if I am ever luckilly enogh to come back to Agadir."
"Having stayed in dozens of 5 star resort hotels, the Sofitel Thalassa is certainly one of the best. The hotel is modern, very clean and a beautiful design right on its private sandy beach. The huge heated outdoor pool was a bonus in February although air temp was never below 25c in the day. The sister Sofitel is next door and guests can enjoy the 5 restaurants and facilities.
The food choice and quality was perfect and the chefs explained everything.
The best experience of our stay was the service. All staff managed to strike the perfect balance of friendliness and efficiency. Always discreetly watching for any needs you may have. The Life guard and pool supervisor Said was amazing. Perfect manners, language skills, local knowledge and extremely efficient.
Here is the ...but. I recommend you to avoid French school holiday dates (February for sure) out of control youngsters having great fun but spoiling other guests enjoyment at the pool and in the lounge bar until late.

You must visit this hotel"
"Our stay at Sofitel Thalasaa Agadir exceeded our expectations . Great Rooms , Fantastic View , excellent amnetites, lively facilities and outlets and excellent service including Abdul Latif from Reception.  But 1. 1st hotel ever where Sauna Jacuzzi Steam is NOT free for hotel guests . "
"My wife and I arrived at the hotel and the end of November to stay for 7 nights after a terrible 4 days stay in Marrakesh. We got to Agadir bus station from Marrakesh and got into a taxi, the taxi driver was possibly the most horrible man I have met in my life and our trip was pretty much ruined so far.

We got to the lobby and my wife and I were in such a state of anger and shock that we failed to realise how great the hotel decor was. The reception staff were polite and helpful.

We were initially given room 15, which was a tad bit too small for my liking so we spent one night in that particular room. The following evening I went to arrange plans about my wife's birthday the next day and I met Karim. He helped me arrange all that I needed to and helped arrange the most delicious chocolate cake. I also took the opportunity to ask someone who was truly interested in making our stay in Morocco pleasurable about how much it would cost to get a room upgrade. He quoted me a fair price but asked me to see the particular room before making my decision. 

The room was perfect, I think room 276, it had unobstructed views of the sea, a king size bed, waterfall shower, etc. After viewing the room, I went back to speak karim and he asked me what I thought of the room. I loved it and so did my wife, but she particularly wanted a tub in the room to have a bath. Karim informed us that tubs are only available in the suites (that was out of my price range) but he surprised me by offering the room as a free upgrade. For the first time since arriving in Morocco did someone do something for us without any financial motives. 

We stayed in the room for the following 6 nights and had the most amazing stay. We had brought some chocolate to eat from Fortnum & Masons in London, but decided to give that to Karim as a gift before we left. 

The hotel overall was perfect, I think we went in the off season and was pretty empty, which I didn't mind at all. The pool is heated, but use of the indoor pool/spa facilities have to be paid for separately and is not included in the price of the room. Room service was great, better than most hotels I've stayed in (5* on the palm in Dubai)

Overall a great hotel, with great staff. Only thing you're not allowed to do is bring food/drinks from outside the hotel."
"Dont know where to start.. ok so I along with my partner and baby son Adam attended this hotel on 24/01/17. We booked this hotel for 4 nights. Upon arrival we were amazed by the breathtaking beauty of the hotel.  After a fairly long flight, Adam was tired and irritable. We tried to keep him calm and quiet so he would not disturb anyone else ( this can be very challenging with a hyper 2 year old!!). Our room was not ready so we sat in the reception area, nearly every member of staff came over to us to play with Adam and entertain him.! This made us feel so happy and relaxed. We had only been waiting for 15 minutes, when the manager approached us and stated he would be upgrading us! We were so happy with this.! ( both my wife and I are not the type of people that ask for anything for free, we are far to shy to ask) It truly made us so happy. We were taken into the room and could not believe our eyes. The room i believe was a junior suite.  We had a large living room next to the bedroom area, 2 tvs, terrace with two outdoor beds. The living area was huge, this was particularly great for our son who could run around all day.  

We enjoyed breakfast every morning, and spent some evenings in the bar area. The staff all all knew my sons name and would show so much affection towards him, always giving him lollipops and sweets!.  

Unfortunately on the day we were supposed to fly back home, my son cut his head while playing at the airport. We were not allowed to board the flight. We were taken by ambulance to the local hospital.  The doctors cleared him, however we were very stressed, and afraid as we had missed flight, didnt speak the language and did not know where we were. I called the hotel and spoke with staff. They immediately sent a car to pick us up.  Once we arrived back at the hotel, it felt like the whole staff were waiting for us. Everyone was so supportive, and concerned about Adam and our situation. I asked to check in again, and stated I did not know when I would be checking out. Without even talking about the fee, I had full faith in the staff they would give me the best deal possible, which they did. They once again gave us the prestige room to make everything comfortable.  We had ran out of nappies and other things, and the hotel sent out their driver to get us the items we needed. We stayed an extra 3 nights. When checking out we were actually quite emotional. These people had in a way became family to us. They went above and beyond what was expected of them.  There words of comfort helped both my wife and I during our stressful times. I cannot thank them enough. We are looking to book a holiday in April/May they have left us with no option to but to go back to Agadir just so we can stay at their hotel.  Wonderful staff.. Wonderful hotel.. Wonderful place..

I want to thank a few staff members by name..

1. Ghizlome  - Your support and kind words helped us in a way which you cannot imagine. You are a true professional and i cannot thank you enough

2. Kamal - The hotel driver that went out of his way to get us nappies etc. Thank you for doing this. We were very stressed out at the time and you helped to make things easy for us.  

3. Clement - Trainee manager i believe, the hotel is in very good hands if you are going to be the future manager. True gent, very well mannered, and always there willing to help in any way possible. 

4. Jehome - Assistant manager, very kind and passionate women. (also very goodlooking!) always engaging in conversation, and made you feel like your part of a big hotel family. 

5. Oussama guest relations manager, very friendly man, and the person behind upgrading our room. True gent very courteous. You helped make our stay the best ever, we will be coming back no doubt.

6. Cheayb - bar man, very good guy. He opened up the piano for Adam to play with. Knowing he could very well damage it, Cheayb saw the happiness it brought my son and took the chance. I liked his attitude, as many jobsworth would never have allowed this. Thank you for making it so enjoyable, and giving us the opportunity of taking so many photos!

7. Bouchra - Thank you for meeting all our needs and making things so easy for us .

8 Abdellotif  Manager i believe, A truly great man, always a smile on his face. I know you played a part in making sure we get the best deal. I didnt even need to ask about prices because i trusted you and your team so much. I noticed on the bill you had not charged for pick up from hospital. I want to thank you for this.  Its not the money, its the humanity thats so touching. You and your team have been brilliant to us and we cannot wait to come back soon. 

If I had to pick 1 person as standing out the most I would have to pick Maryem, room service girl that would clean our room each morning. She did not speak one word of English, but we still managed to communicate.  She was very hard working, always smiley, and always helping me to find matches!. 

Once again thank you all and look forward to seeing you soon.  

Abas Shah, Mehwash Gilani and Adam Shah."
"We had a really good time at the Sofitel Agadir Thalassa Sea & Spa. The service was perfect.  The Hotel is beautiful. The private beach is so nice.The Had the best surf lesson with Nourredine. Thanks again :)"
"Our third holiday at Sofitel Agadir Thalassa Sea & Spa and the best yet.  The welcome afforded by the staff who remember you from year to year and greet you as old friends could not be bettered anywhere in the world. The level of service is outstanding."
"Thumbs up for a Fascinating stay in this wonderful hotel. Ghizlane and Mehdi did more than expected to help us enjoy our stay and boost it to the top.
Again, THANKS GHIZLANE&MEHDI for your professionalism and excellence."
"Really lovely staff, comfortable beds and great service. Spa was expensive and was just left after the treatment, so was disappointed it was not more customer friendly. Love the hotel itself and would certainly return "
"We enjoyed our time here. The hotel is very modern, the facilities are excellent. E best thing is the staff- genuinely service orientated and all out to help and spot with the balance of service and attentiveness. A special mention for karim who was very kind and helpful. Dalila was very charming too! 

Breakfasts wide ranging and extensive. Sitting outside with a view of the sea in the sun was wonderful- even in a January.

The only odd thing is the rather questionable art installations. Not my taste but art is subjective. It just felt a little kitsch after coming in a wonderfully elegant entrance and reception area. 

The hotel is right on he beach so no need t walk 5 minutes like its neighbours...

I hope to get back here soon."
"Me and my wife went for our honeymoon weekend in agadir and booked a standard room in Sofitel. We requested upgrade and we were given amazing sea view suite with lovely roses etc. Pool, food, restaurant, well come tea at arrivals, airport meet and greet, room services, everything was so perfect. We were very very well looked after and special thanks to Atif at the reception and Mohammad at the concierge. We be going back in march again. Umer"
"Friendly and attentive staff, whimsical art, a friendly house cat named So, a lounge singer with her piano man and luxe beds all with views of the ocean...we couldn't have asked for more. we didn't eat at the property, but we did have cocktails at the pool and the lounge which were very good. Didn't have a chance to try the spa, but I did take a peak at it and it looked amazing. This property is beachfront and soothing."
"For us it was rather a personal experience rather than hotel accommodation. The welcome reception , adjustment of our room requirements were fabulously managed by Mr. Kareem. The wishes were read from lips during our stay. Mrs. Ghizlan, guest manager were always there when we needed her. The housekeeping and restaurant Staff were very friendly. Our Request from Brasserie were delivered from Chef . At most we have enjoyed our Breakfast at the Terrace with Ocean view and Birds escorting us. The Staff were excellent. It happened to be once leaving the Hotel to meet also Mr. Kareem from the reception to wish us a safe flight. We felt we were staying at home. Of course the Hotel was luxurious as expected. We also got used to the rather dark amenities and found it beautiful by time. We wish they keep up the standards they have achieved and always with personal touch."
"I stayed in this hotel with my son for a golf vacation in december.
A first bonus was a room upgrade to a nice suite. 
The hotel has 3 restaurants. One of it, the market place , is a buffet style  restaurant, that is very good. Next time I will book room and half board. 
I also have to say that the staff was very helpfull.
One suggestion to the management is to provide the staff at the front desk with more small mone to exchange. You can get local dirhams at the cashmachine, but the smallest amount is 100 dirhams, appr. 10 euros. I like to tip for good service, but 10 euro's for bringing a bucket of ice to the room is a bit too much."
"We researched 5 star hotels in Agadir on Trip Advisor and chose Sofitel Agadir Thalassa Sea and Sun because of good reviews and close proximity to the beach. We were very pleased with our choice. The hotel is spacious and very stylish. Exceptionally clean, there are always people mopping and polishing every available surface.  The staff are very friendly and accommodating, nothing is too much trouble. The pool is large and heated and has a huge amount of very comfortable loungers dotted around. There was always a team of people working around the pool, ready to fetch towels or drinks from the pool bar.  The hotel joins the beach and has its own staffed lounger area.  The beach is wide and sandy.
Before flying out we had requested a top floor room with a western view (hoping for sunsets from the balcony) This was what we had.  The room was spacious, clean with a very comfortable bed.  The balcony was comfortable seating and a large table. When we discovered that we couldn’t actually see the sunset from our balcony due to the winter sun setting position, the staff on reception were only too happy to  change our room to one facing south where some lovely sunsets could be viewed.
Breakfast was included in our holiday deal and the food was mostly fresh, plentiful and varied. There was an egg station making omelettes and a fruit smoothie station.
The beach promenade runs from the hotel to the marina, approximately 6km away.  A pleasant walk, where local vendors will offer the usual African crafts, silver jewellery or kaftans.  They are not pushy if you are not interested.  Apart from hotel restaurants, the nearest bars and restaurants are about 30 mins walk away and most are at the marina end of the promenade.  The local orange taxis will take you to along the front area for 20 drm or 30 at night).
This is a perfect hotel if you just want to relax by the beach or pool, but if you want to do more, you need to get transport."
"Claimed to be one of the best hotels in Africa but as we haven’t tried all the other African hotels making that claim we cannot substantiate it but there is no doubt it is very, very good. Having just returned from a ten day half board stay my wife and I cannot praise it highly enough. 

As to be expected the food is mainly Moroccan but it does have other varied nights with food from around the world on offer, all presented to a very high standard. The staff are all most helpful and courteous nothing was ever too much trouble. In this respect the poolside attendants deserve a special mention.

Our room was large sea facing and kept spotlessly clean.  Air conditioning was very efficient without being obtrusive.

The hotel is only about three years old and is the last to be built at the end of a long promenade which means short taxi rides to the marina or town centre which are both cheap and plentiful. 

Would we visit again? I think not as we both found apart from sunbathing and being papered to excess there was little else to do but if that is what you want we cannot think of a better place to be."
"I travelled alone in October 2016 and booked a 24 treatment package to reinforce my silhouette. The journey started perfectly! As there were no direct flights from Geneva do Agadir, I landed in Marrakash and Kamel the driver from the hotel was already waiting for me. The ride took about 3 hours to Agadir, during this time Kamel made sure that I felt comfortable and stopped where ever I asked him to do so, enough time to take some pictures or enjoying a coffee. It was a nice experience to discover the beautiful landscape by car, which changes from each region to the other. Booked Kamel for the ride back as I really enjoyed his professionalism. We arrived a bit earlier at the Sofitel, the reception staff gave me a warm welcome and did not hesitate to give me a room earlier to rest. The room was very cozy with a beautiful view to the pool and sea from the balcony! The big bed was very comfortable. Had half board included, breakfast was delicious with lot's of choices and fresh fruit juice. Rachid, my waitress who took care of me during my stay had always a smile on his face and is always at your service, when you need anything. I highly recommend the Thalassa & SPA, every treatment is a journey! The ladies Laila, Fati, Raja, Hanane and Hind will make you feel like on heaven. My personal coach Issam is a big motivator and showed me the right technics to ensure my Aquagym & Cardio sessions are held smoothly to achieve the end result I was expecting. The pool is huge and the privat beach lovely. In short, the perfect place to relax and go with the flow. Thanks again to all Sofitel staff, it was an unforgettable time and for sure not the last time."
"Went there with my in-laws, my husband & my kids.
Great hotel & very nice staff! 
The breakfast buffet is mainly continental & every day the same, nothing local except moroccan crepes that you need to ask them to prepare (what a shame). Otherwise excellent food in restaurants!
Very calm area, great pool & beach.

Surprises: 1. as we chose the full board option, we were surprised to discover that parents & kids don't have the same allowance (adult: 130 dirhams/ kids: 90 dirhams) per menu, excluding drinks.
2. The bill at the checkout was not correct, but fortunately we kept copies each time we went to restaurants. There was a difference of 400Dh in total. 
Advice: ask for the checking out bill one day before leaving the hotel and not 30min  before as we did!

Still would be happy to return to this hotel!
"
"I always travel to agadir and this is my first time at Sofitel Thalassa, i stayed 2 nights in this beautiful hotel, the place is very nice and very well located ! Just small remark (but important) the service needs some improvement in restaurant and housekeeping ! Otherwise it is a place to recommend for good and relaxing weekends !"
"This Sofitel is definitely the best hotel in Morocco. Situated in beautiful Agadir with its own private section for the beach, it definitely deserves to be called the best hotel in Morocco. I never felt unsafe in the hotel since the private area of the beach is always guarded. The design of the hotel is exquisite: very modern and overlooking the beach. It is connected to the older Sofitel and we can use the amenities there as well which is really convenient. The staff is extremely friendly, respectful, helpful and professional. They are always happy and smiling.  I love the fact that there is live music both during breakfast and during dinner. The restaurant has gorgeous views on the pool and the beach beyond with an amazing selection of food. I would definitely recommend the Sofitel for anyone who goes to Morocco and Agadir! "
"AGADIR'S ""boardwalk"" is impressive ; at least 7 kilometers long.
The 2 Sofitels are at one end and the marina at the other.
The location was perfect for me but some might find it a bit out of the way.
The Sofitel Thalassa is a beautiful hotel but in my opinion it was especially built with sunny weather in mind. (The use of very dark  colors indoors is in that case soothing)
Unfortunately during my one week (end of march 2015) stay the weather was mostly overcast and I found the setting a bit depressing
The room was very nice even  though I don't appreciate clear glass doors on the shower.
Service in general was excellent and yet I was  disappointed to learn that the 2 Sofitels with several hundreds of rooms do not organize tours for their guests.. If the city tours are full you have no other option but to rent a car with a chauffeur.
The spa and the gym are very good.
Breakfast was perfect.
The Sofitel is a very good hotel and I would love to go back"
"It's been over 2 years since I was last here. If you are wondering, the Resort Bay Sofitel is directly next door and is dressed to look ""authentic"" Maroc - the Thalassa Sea and Spa is unashamedly modern European and in my view, preferable for it. But you can easily share facilities/restaurants etc with each hotel.

A slight issue with the room (a few small ants, not untypical in any hotel anywhere in the world) led to the lovely Ms Ghizlan at front desk sorting me out with a new room, which coincidentally also had a better sea view. Pretty much all rooms have some sort of sea view.

Wifi: reasonably good and available throughout hotel, including pool - also, free.

Gym: very good, with an excellent resident personal trainer called Issam who is actually a kickboxer. 

Room: how quickly rooms can age - 2 years ago as fresh as a daisy but now showing some fatigue, BUT still very cool, love the naughty mirror which only sometimes divides the bathroom with the bedroom and nice products, most of which I managed to get into my suitcase... 😮😂

Bed was very comfortable, too.

Food: yes it is expensive eg dinner was about 400 dirhams (about £40?) without drink (I don't) but it's a Sofitel not McDonalds so what do you expect? Authentic local food plus Italian such as pasta and pizza available every evening. Cheeseboard could have been more varied considering this is a French chain. Breakfasts plentiful, everything you'd expect and no rush. 

Staff: all lovely, friendly, accommodating - no complaints or issues at all. Good English, though my attempts at asking for toothpaste proved more comical than anything else (come on Sofitel, offer your guests some mouthwash or toothpaste!)

Security: lots more of it than 2 years ago, guy at main gate gives you a good look but is always friendly; plus evening security within the grounds; a walk along the promenade and I saw armed police and soldiers. Good. It didn't infringe on my stay and I think it's right for everyone to take security seriously, including guests. 

Beach: one of the highlights is that the hotel grounds go straight on to the beach, where he Sofitel has a private area. Agadir beach is beautiful dark golden sand. It is wide and goes on for miles. The entire hotel overlooks the sea and it's beautiful. 

Two constructive pieces of feedback - the grounds are a bit boring. Just grass and hedges for the most part. Maroc is all about the beautiful flowers and their scents - I know it is a cost but they could use some investment to make the gardens more attractive and fragrant. Second, charge for treatments by all means, but allow guests to use the steam room and jacuzzi for free - it is a Spa hotel after all (the jacuzzi is so big, it even has its own mini gym in the water itself!).

I stayed a few days to just be on my own in a luxury hotel by the sea, after a difficult year for me. Might be odd for staff to see someone do that, but my privacy was never questioned. It was perfect and in fact the hotel did a deal to allow me to stay a few days extra at a fair price. I'd recommend it over the Sofitel next door and it's got to be one of the best in Agadir for the luxury experience. 

My condolences to the staff, who suffered a loss of one of their own while I was there.

"Very nice hotel with friendly staff. The pool and location on the beach are amazing. The breakfast buffet is great with lots of options. The rooms are very clean and neat. The spa is a little expensive"
"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this hotel. The hotel is quite new and I would describe the decor as modern Moroccan. 
 
Pros:
-The rooms were spacious and very clean. 
-The king sized bed was very comfortable. 
-Large selection of foods for breakfast
-The pool area is beautiful and very relaxing.
-We ordered food by the pool which was delicious.
-The spa has a large indoor pool with exercise machines and jets. 
-Adequate parking spaces 

Cons:
-Although the hotel is situated on the ocean front and there are private sunbeds pertaining to the hotel, the shore is public so it can get crowded in the afternoons or during the summer, at which point it's more enjoyable to chill by the pool. However that is the case with all ocean front hotels in Agadir and even Casablanca."
"Located on the beach of agadir this hotel keeps its promise.  Nice broad rooms in Moroccan style with helpful and friendly staff. Enormous pool centers the hotel. If you want to visit agadir in style without the noise and other drawbacks of a resort this is the best option. "
"Stayed for two nights. In the beginning didnt like at all : long boring corridors, a lot of people, no privacy, crying children. Room is small, no place.

But later i just got main idea about this hotel and started to enjoy this atmosphere.

Surely,  main hall is amazing: black&white, luxurious, statues. Terrace perfect as well. Was great to have breakfast: a lot of space for everyone.

Swimming pool was good too, plenty place to get sun. 

Spa was not far away. Unfortunately it was for additional price. Was surprise. But likely we were only two persons in huge spa resort. Nobody liked to go. Tried also massage with warm oils : was very very good experience. 

Close to Sofitel is disco club. And of course ocean! "
"We enjoyed a week here in August as a couple and were not disappointed when it came to the hotel grounds - it really is beautiful, albeit with some rather quirky ceramic animals which randomly adorn the lobby areas. The decor was very modern and relatively well kept (a few cracks and broken things in the nooks and crannies but kept very clean overall). We enjoyed the deluxe room with a large double bed and quite enjoyed being able to watch TV or spy on our SO whilst in the shower, via the glass. There is a great selection for breakfast, including a huge bakery, freshly baked pancakes, a range of delicious and freshly-made smoothies and other cooked items. Sadly, little 'English breakfast' items and no English breakfast tea but plenty of tea/coffee options and juices to choose from. The overall look of this hotel and the facilities do appear 5* but we did have a few gripes that I feel are worth mentioning, which detract from the overall 5* experience:
- The service is pretty slow and inattentive. We only ate at the hotel at breakfast (see below comments on expense of hotel) and, whilst I understand this is probably their busiest time of service, the service was very slow given the amount of staff ""working"" (several of which are just stood around - mostly the female staff in suits, who seem reluctant to lift a finger) and the breakfast staff were frequently quite grumpy - it felt like we were a hassle for turning up and daring to ask for a table. We frequently had to re-request basic things like tea spoons, cutlery, milk or wait quite a few minutes for a table to be made ready. This wouldn't be so much of a problem if all the guests were treated the same way....(see next comment).
- It is very clear which guests in the hotel are VIPs. I understand that certain guests may have paid more, or may be treated as VIPs due to their frequent returns. But we felt this to be at the detriment to other 'normal' guests. For example, if we asked for a table at breakfast it was met with a very slow reaction, we normally had to ask a couple of times and it took several minutes to get the table set. And the staff seemed pretty grumpy that they had to help. We witnessed other guests arrive and suddenly 4 staff were setting up a table for them and it was made within seconds, nothing seemed to be too much trouble at all. We could barely get the attention of one member of staff so it was very clear when several staff herded round one table that these guests must be some kind of special, which we were not! This seemed to lead to 'one rule for one and another rule for another', for example, upon asking if it was possible to have a shisha on our room balcony we were abruptly told this was ""impossible"" - yet the only reason we had asked was because we had seen other guest(s) doing exactly that...
- Beware of the ""large double""! My partner and I had been suffering from back-ache in our first few nights of sleep and just put this down to the over-zealous bedding which defines the hotel sleeping experience (we usually prefer harder beds). However, we noticed that we were actually sleeping on two single bed-frames and two single mattresses which were ""dressed up"" as a large double, causing a dip in the middle of the bed which was super uncomfortable. So night 3 was spent sleeping on the floor as, after speaking with reception, we were told that something could only be done tomorrow after someone else had checked out. It was a bit of hassle getting this sorted - my partner speaks perfect French and explained to the service/hotel staff that we had paid for a large double and even if the singles were pushed together (they frequently moved apart), it created a dip in the middle of the bed which caused severe backache. After sending away the men who appeared with zip ties (!) they agreed to move us next door: an identical room with an actual double bed! Perfect - I just wish we had this from day 1 - please take note, hotels: two singles pushed together IS NOT the same as a large double. We were grateful for the situation having been resolved but not for the amount of time explaining and chasing the staff to do so. 
- The hotel is ludicrously expensive in terms of food and the facilities. A basic sandwich costs 150 dirham (£11) and can of coke 45 dirham (£3.50) - and these were the chepeast items on the poolside menu. Therefore, we did not eat very often at the hotel, which was a shame given that we had chosen a resort for the ease of using its facilities and assumed that the general prices in Agadir would be somewhat reflected in this hotel. Of course, we expect a premium based on the hotel rating but £3.50 for a can of coke is ridiculous, and seemed to be a deterrent to many who would otherwise happily blow their cash entirely in the resort. Instead, we ate out every night, spending 15 dirham on a can of coke and using 150 dirham to buy a hearty main meal (and sometimes a starter too, all included in Sofitel's price of a sandwich).
- Bringing food and drink into the hotel is ""strictly forbidden"" and our bags were frequently searched on entry to the hotel to check for these ""restricted items"". This seems a bit excessive. We weren't aware of this rule until day 3-ish of our stay, and had only bought bread, cheese and crisps into our room to enjoy over lunch for the previous days (see comment about expense). We were then told this was a no-no and that such items would be confiscated if we did so again. So basically, blow a shed-load of money in the hotel or get out for lunch/dinner. Although, saw several other guests carrying McDonalds through the hotel in the evening. Presumably these were VIPs?
- All of the spa facilities need to be paid for. Again, it seemed quite expensive to us so we ended up not using any of these facilities, which was a shame. And the jacuzzi is classed as a ""treatment"", which I've never heard before in my life. I can understand why: classing it as a ""treatment"" means they can charge for its use, rather than just letting all their guests enjoy this facility. 
- Unfortunately the same 30-track house playlist is on repeat every day by the poolside, which seems to intermittently get louder. This was such a shame, given the hotel's proximity to the beach and the desire of probably-many to just relax by the pool and soak up the sounds of the beach. We frequently asked if this could be turned off/down, as the speakers are right next to some of the best sunloungers, but these requests were just ignored. So unfortunately, if you want to lay by the poolside, expect a constant thudding and to have this playlist stuck in your head for days on end (It's still stuck in my head now). We were going to escape to the beach for some respite but were met with a live DJ! Really, this is not club-med. 
- Whilst the pool is really beautiful, it was a slight shame that the children's pool is not separated. This meant constantly ducking and diving to avoid children running and jumping in around and everywhere in the pool. Happy to share but this gets a bit tedious after a while, especially given that the central part of the pool is an attractive running, jumping and stomping ground for kids, making a relaxing swim basically impossible. Also unsure of the cleanliness of the pool - couldn't smell/taste any chlorine..

Overall, we enjoyed our stay as the hotel is really beautiful. Ultimately, Sofitel could improve by ensuring its staff are providing a 5* experience to all of its guests and charging more reasonable prices: As it stands, the Sofitel experience is dangerously close to ostracizing a large group of guests who stay at the hotel or a ""treat"", and can't afford to splash huge sums of money to afford the facilities or stellar service, which should be included in its already hefty price tag."
"Just came back 1 week ago from Sofitel. The hotel had an amazing vibe and is designed to perfection, the bedroom and bathroom were very clean. Although, I'm surprised I haven't seen reviews about the bathroom situation, perhaps many were comfortable with it, myself and my sister found it very odd that the bathroom hadn't any doors, to either of its sides. Above the bed there was a window that looks straight into the shower. In the day, the window had become a mirror but in the night it was transparent. We found out that all rooms had this situation. I guess it's okay for a couple but for anyone else it can be a little weird. Just leave the tap running hot to steam the window up. This won't be a problem for those who don't mind showering in front of an audience. This hotel in terms of architecture and design is quite fascinating. 

You must be aware that the spa is not included with the hotel room price, it was quite surprising considering the hotel is named after the spa, one may think the spa was inclusive. The price for the spa cost 200 MAD (£16 each) for 2 hours, although the time can be extended if spa is empty, which it usually is. I recommend spending some time in the spa as you will have access to the jacuzzi (which is huge!) and the steam room. If you want a hammam/ massage this will cost extra. The spa is mixed, not segregated. Be aware there isn't a sauna. 

The service in Sofitel was quite slow, although I found this to be a common factor throughout Morocco. The staff at breakfast are very slow, I ordered a cappuccino and received it 45 mins later. But it wasn't much of an issue as Sofitel Thalassa was a nice, clean hotel. 

Breakfast wasn't full English, more French. Nonetheless, it's tasty. From omelettes to fruits. There is a large variety. There is seating outside so it was nice to eat breakfast overlooking the beach. 

However, be warn that the weather in Agadir isn't amazing-that's coming from a Londoner- do not go expecting blue skies, we were told this by another and realised it to be true. I guess climate change has hit Agadir (Marrakech is way more hotter than Agadir considering it's only a 3 hr drive) 

Additionally, my parents and I were completely split up, them being on the other side of the hotel (5min walk) if your travelling in a family request nearby rooms by emailing that hotel directly. 

Many of the staff didn't speak English, again this is a common problem throughout Agadir. French and Arabic are the main languages. Menus and general signs around Agadir are all in French. 

I must take this chance and say that Agadir is not an area for tourist, if you are travelling to Agadir, try not booking too many days (3 days max) there isn't much sights to see apart from the famous Agadir hill and the marina to enjoy some grilled fish and perhaps a tour of the city. Maybe try visiting Marrakech along with Agadir, Marrakech is a tourist hotspot. 

Agadir resembles that of a resort, it's a relaxing getaway, so in that case Sofitel Thalassa is perfect for such a stay, the pool area is large with sun chairs lining the area. Although it's not always hot in Agadir so don't expect an immediate tan. On our first day we found it quite cold, but on our last day it reached to 40 degree Celsius.

The location is ideal, as the main boulevard/street is just one right turn from Sofitel Thalassa. 

Sofitel Thalassa has a private beach for guest, although it doesn't extend to the actual water of the beach, nonetheless the private area has comfortable loungers. 

Also, taxis have a 3 person limit, so if you're  a family of four or more than you'll have to get a larger taxi which costs more. 

Hope this helped anyone.

"We stayed 15 days in this nice hotel, close to the beach, amazing view from the balcony, and spacious rooms.
The hotel is getting tired, maintenance and room cleanliness is an area that needs to be looked at. Services needs improvements and staff need a lot of trainings.
In general we enjoyed our stay, staff are very friendly and ready to serve clients with their limited knowledge but they are very helpful and always offers assistance.
Jafri Meryem from reception team is a very hard worker who made our stay comfortable and enjoyable, we thank her for her care and assistance to coordinate our requests 
Concierge and bell desk team are doing their best to make the first impression always positive. We thank them for making sure our luggage and car is been always taking care of. 
We would like to thank the executive housekeeper and her team in housekeeping and laundry for taking care of our rooms and laundry although we had few comments we shared with the manager and the response was very wick and got our room fixed the way we want.
The SPA is exceptional and we enjoyed the massage and Moroccan Hammam, we would like to thank all the professional therapist Hana, Faty, Laila, ... And many I don't recall the names but they are a great team.
The pool and beach team took care of our place and made sure the day ad spend in the pool and the beach enjoyable,,, thank you so much
We highly recommend this hotel for the guest who are looking for a family time, relaxation and rest,,,this is the right place
Thank you Sofitel Agadir team and looking forward to see you soon when our travel bring us back to this lovely city

"I love the setting - located on the beach - the rooms overlook the pool and beach - it's so beautiful to watch the sunsets from your private terrace. The bed is of course incredibly comfortable (as are all Sofitel beds) and the breakfast and dinner buffets are delicious. There is plenty of lounging/seating area near the pool and a separate area on the beach."
"Let me just start by saying it's extremely well deserved!

Amazing place to stay, the staff were so welcoming and i felt like queen during my stay .

Cleanliness was 100% also the room was great looking over the beach. I had one wish That i could stay longer .

Thanks to the management and the fantastic staff specially Omar from the reception , Noura Boushra for being  always helpful and welcoming ,  from F&B Karim and Simohamed from In Room Dining are well trained and will help you in any which way required with no issue.
"
"Perfect view, excellent design, freindly staff and mostly great service.
Both Concierges 
during my stay were very helpful. Delicate decorated rooms, nice fitnesscenter, location, beach and poolarea. Priceworthy during our stay. Level of high service could vary dependable of whom you got the service."
"If you are sophisticated and like finer things in life and you're planning a visit in Agadir, look no further, this is the place to be. Absolutely perfect in every way just amazing. Some people may find little pricey but you get what you pay for and here, your money will be well spent. Looking forward to go back again soon"
"This hotel is great. Lovely views from rooms. Just would like to thank Khadija for service, from market place in breakfast. She is lovely. Service is the best and she always brightens our day. I would like to recommend this hotel. 
Nice swiming pools in this hotel. The staff outside are good. I would also like to thank ghizlan she is very good. Most of all i would like to thank the director in operations Mr Kamil. Always makes our stay excellent.  We have stayed here the second time now only because of Mr Kamil. "
"A lovely swanky looking hotel but very dark and poorly lit, and there were problems with electrics (sockets in room not working, lights out etc). This hotel is lovely and the outdoor space is fantastic but the service is inconsistent and some aspects are not very well run. Our waiter in the bar called Larbi was fantastic and really looked after us extremely well - a lovely, humble and kind man. Other areas of service were slow and inconsistent and some of tthe staff not particularly helpful. The music on CD in the bar was repetitive and the same tracks played on repeat every day, most evenings it was also far too loud and it was difficult to have a conversation. However the live music by Wavelength (Sandra Bouza & Kevin D Cummings) was great, it provided the perfect backdrop to a beautiful Moroccan sunset and happy evenings chilling in the bar. They involved the guests, taking requests and sharing their local knowledge after the sets. We had a lovely time with friends here but if we were to visit Agadir again we would stay elsewhere, I think the management are trying to make the hotel into something it isn't quite geared up for, and the service needs to be more streamlined and efficient in general. The room cleaning and turn down service was different every day, some days we had turndown, others not and one day they would leave us water and glasses, others not. In the restaurant, the tables were rarely fully set with cutlery and napkins, we invariably ended up searching for a  spoon or salt n pepper or some such.  It is also very surprising to encounter smoking inside the hotel and when coming from Europe where it is no longer permitted it makes for an uncomfortable atmosphere. These are all really small niggly problems but if you're paying for 5 star then you expect certain standards."
"We spent a week at Thalassa Spa looking for a relaxing break and some sun before our baby arrives. We stayed in room 256 and the room was lovely and no problems at all. The bed was extremely comfortable and i slept like a log and the best i have in my whole 33 weeks of pregnancy, We didn't leave the hotel apart from a daily walk along the beach and was fabulous, very clean beach, a few people bothered you to buy things but a ""no thank you"" and they carry on walking. 

Amine made our holiday, he was fab and such a lovely guy. Soon as we got to the pool everyday he was straight over moving my sun lounger, placing out my towel and grabbing me an umbrella. They always looked after us for the whole week. They looked after me and the baby very well and always brought water etc to us. 

The food was a huge let down! It was generally cooked well, We had to send one lunch meal back as the fish wasn't cooked. The buffet is extremely expensive for what there is. We ate 3 times in Place da Jardin as this worked out cheaper for us and a half bottle of wine than the actual buffet.  The food at lunch was very mediocre and eating by the pool was much better than actually ordered at the restaurant. 

The pool was very clean, although absolutely FREEZING!!! haha and the loungers were extremely comfortable. What i would say is people around the pool need to be more organised as we came down most mornings to no towels and having to ask then the waiters/waitresses running around trying to find towels, even thought the hotel was very quite and barely anyone around the pool. 

We went over to the sister hotel once to the So Good restaurant and the food was much better then in the Thalassa. Although our hotel was much better and looked newer. The food makes a big impression on your holiday. 

We also on Easter Sunday had an easter egg left for us that was a lovely surprise. 

Once again thank you for a lovely baby moon and we will return once the baby is here for another relaxing break and a huge Thank you to Amine xx"
"Great location. No doubt best in Agadir. Enjoyed our stay and the best thing about the hotel and Agadir was the people. Really lovely and kind. Although the service is not 5 star and that's not because the employees were lazy but on the contrary very friendly and willing to serve. But I think they could be trained better. In my opinion the coverage of all the sitting areas were not done very well. U could be sitting for hours and no body would ask you for a drink or if you need anything because they are busy running around. Possibly lack of staff in my eyes. In a 5 star hotel a hotel employee has his domain and when you enter their domain you need to onto your guest like a hawk, offer them a menu and ask what would they like to drink. But all that courtesy was missing. One you manage to attract a staff's attention you would get good service. 

What made the evenings so special was Live music at night in the bar by Sandra and Kevin. I must say that was a lovely touch and the only reason we would go to the bar. They really created a great ambiance and made our every night feel like a proper 5 star holiday and they were taking requests and interacting with the guests. Really enjoyed every moment in their company. They would be one of the reason I would return. 

Food was not to everyone's palette. It was not bad but it was not special for the price we paid. Food and drinks were so expensive and didn't live up to the expectation. 

The best thing about the place was the location and the lovely Moroccan. Staff and people. 

Room was very nice with a great view stayed in Room 209 I would recommend that to anyone. Best room with the best view of the pool and the ocean. 

Not very Well trained staff and lack of superb service is mainly letting the place down. Otherwise it was very nice. 

Hope you guys an improve so there will be a better next time for us and many others to come and enjoy Moroccan hospitality. "
"Had a week in a prestige suite as a couple. I can not have been more pleased with this hotel, especially the staff who were all friendly and helpful. You can have what you want when you want and where you want. Everything is accommodates for you.. Attention to detail is on point too. Had 2 treatments each at the spa here and although it is expensive almost double the price you'd pay at a top London spa, it was a good experience and did feel brand new after the treatments! The food is quite pricey at the hotel for what you get but there are plenty nice restaurants in agadir that are slightly less!

I would like to say a special thank you to meryem  and abdullatif at the front desk! And amine who's doing his work experience working by the pool.. He was extremely helpful and should be considered a credit to Sofitel!

Would definitely stay here again! "
"With the Sofitel brand you expect nice surroundings, above average service and good quality food. And this hotel scores highly in all of these areas. The gym is small but adequate and the outdoor pool and sun lounge areas are lovely. The hotel however, is set right at the end of the promenade which means a fair walk is necessary to find some alternative dining options as the food here is a bit over-priced. It seemed apparent that this is the nicest hotel in the area and possibly one of the areas best features as the surrounding parts of Agadir are not as luxurious, at times a bit manic and overwhelming. But the hotel was nice to retreat back to as it is both peaceful and relaxing."
"We returned today from a lovely week at the Sofitel thalassa , as always super comfy beds in the room and around the pool .
I loved all of the black chic decor very classy , the pool service was fab Thankyou to Amine lovely guy , nothing too much trouble , lovely breakfasts and lunches in the Atlantique restaurant , we stayed on bed and breakfast , dined in the hotel on night one but disappointed with the choice , so ate out for the rest of the time , which was ok but some evenings would have loved to just eaten at hotel . Thankyou also for letting us keep our rooms complimentary for a late check out , really nice gesture.
The best  thing is the quiet and peaceful atmosphere , no screaming children or chavs abroad , the best place for upmarket holidays ."
"Sofitel is always a pleasure to visit, anywhere in the world.

From the moment we checked in, staff member Ghizlan made us feel so welcome and gae us many tips for our holiday. Her colleagues were also all very friendly, and especially the staff around the pool, always had time for a chat. 

The hotel is very stylish, and has an elegant touch of modern glam to it. If you like quirky traditional hotels this is not for you. If you like design this is for you!

We ate most of our meals at the hotel and its neighbour property (also Sofitel but older). Breakfast buffet was very good. Lots of options, and even though we were there in a very quiet period there was still full service with many dishes to choose from on the buffet.

Good drinks in the bar but very slow service, especially since some nights we were only a handfull guests there, it often took a lot of time to get service there.

The gym was well equipped, and more than sufficient. Very good.

Room was nice, we got a sea view room, great for watching the sunsets along with a cold moroccan beer. The housekeeping and turndown service was hit and miss every day. Always good cleaning but they often forgot to replace and stock the minibar items, and also water bottles, shower products, towels etc.

All in all, a great stay. We picked the right hotel in Agadir for our stay. Luxurious stay for a good price."
"Having just spent the Mid Term in this hotel for the third year in a row, I have come back to Ireland with my batteries recharged, thanks to the wonderful manager Kamil and staff at this hotel. Nothing is a problem, the service is fantastic and a restful time is guaranteed. The standard of the hotel is excellent, room, food, common areas, pool etc. I would highly recommend it as a place to get away from the frenetic pace of life. Many thank to Khadija, Rizki  and Elham breakfast service and the concierge Mr. Massa. Lovely beach and great walks surround this hotel. A total gem."
"Recently had a lovely stay at Sofitel, it's a super hotel for a relaxed break in a great location. Nice prom out back of hotel for walking next too beach, stretches about 2.5 miles to marina. 
Breakfast in hotel was good with plenty to choose from. One small issue was staff at breakfast first two mornings, they seemed a bit disjointed!! But rest of stay there seemed to be a manager on duty in restaurant for breakfast every morning, and everything ran very smoothly.
Pool side area was lovely, plenty beds/couches/chairs etc.... Plus plenty staff around there to help with whatever was needed.
Overall a lovely hotel and perfect for a relaxing week away."
"This hotel is one of the best hotels in Agadir in my opinion. The grounds are nice. There is a lot of space to walk around in and plenty of space to sun bathe. The breakfast orange juice was fresh and tasty. The best in Agadir in my opinion. What made this hotel extra special to us was the Operations Director, Kamil. This guy is as good as they come; Customer satisfaction is second to none. He made our stay so good that we will not forget. I would like to thank him for this. I would also like to thank Mr Musa. If I'm correct, Ali Musa. He was the first person we were greeted by at the front reception door and we also met him whilst he was the beach guard. He is a very nice person who always made us feel welcome. Highly recommend this hotel to everyone who likes comfort, prestige and class."
"This is a beautiful hotel right on the beach in Agadir. The decor is modern with a Morroccan twist. The pool is lovely and the sun loungers are extremely comfortable with pillows to rest your head. It was so relaxing I had many a snooze lying in the warmth of the sun. The staff are all friendly and helpful, especially Khalid at the pool bar. Breakfast is excellent with plenty of choices available and an omelette, waffle and pancake station with food cooked to order. The Morroccan bread cooked on the griddle is delicious. The lunchtime food at the pool bar was just ok though. The room was nice and spotlessly clean and the bed extremely comfortable. Bottles of water were supplied daily. My only issue is that the lighting was quite dark and there was no flattering mirrors! If I return to Agadir I will certainly stay here again. It was a perfect hotel for a relaxing week in the sun."
"Stayed for one week in November with my husband. Hotel very modern and beautifully decorated. Spa beautiful floated out ......... Buffet was ok preferred breakfast at sister hotel chefs much better especially for eggs/omelette/pancakes.
Furthest end of the cove from the Marina but no problem with strolling the entire length along the walkway it was beautiful as was the beach. Hotel pool very very cold so unfortunately did not take a dip. Sun loungers absolute comfort and no shortage o f places to lie, dubbed, cabana or beach. Reception desk staff extremely helpful and all staff very polite."
"What a lovely hotel. The journey from the airport was around 40 minutes at a safe good pace. Check in was not a problem and they could not help us enough. 

The room was a interesting shape. We had our two young children I'm not sure the shape was good for a toddler and new born but no real complaints. 

Location was beautiful right on the beach and it was quiet. Really tranquil. Strong waves though. 

The breakfast was good. Not a massive range but had what I wanted which was someone making me a fresh omelette some bread and fruit. 

Hotel pool was lovely place to sit and eat. Plenty of room and helpful staff. Kitchen does not open until 12 noon. 

Spa was lovely. My wife used it and again the staff were lovely. Short drive to the marina which was nice for lunch. 

I also played golf at the local courses. Great test of golf and great conditions. 

Can't really complain about any aspect of our stay. Will we be returning. 

100%"
"I visit this hotel with my family In septembre 2014, And i can Tell That was a real 5 stars. Very good service, Check In was so Quick And personnel are very professionnel ..... Room is very modern with a huge balcony. All the Staff are smilling every time you see them.... Breakfast is very delicious And this huge garden is just unbeleivable. We had access To another sofitel ( the Old one) who is connected To this one. Good job everyone there And thank you for making my trip Amazing . Will définitly be back !!!! "
"One of 2 Sofitels on bay of Agadir, this is the more luxurious of the 2 and has an amazing spa complex with a number of different treatments available. 
Modern and bright the decor makes a statement of modern luxury. 
The grounds are centred around the swimming pool and restaurant bar and comfortable sun loungers and cabanas are available. Additionally there is a separate beach terrace with thatched cabanas. 
Staff very attentive but not 'in your face '. A peaceful and relaxing hotel. "
"Nights : 2

Booked through: Sofitel reservation, Zineb Yassine

Special mention to: Majid (Head Butler) for meeting our every need with regards to the suite we booked.

After spending hours debating whether to book the end of my honeymoon with Sofitel TS&S, I can happily say I was not disappointed.

Upon arrival, the modern European influenced decor is extremely noticeable. The reservation staff had us seated for a short time (30 mins) and took us on a short tour of the hotel which was a great introduction. We were taken straight to our suite which was beautifully decorated with an ocean view. Some specific fittings and furnishings in the bathroom really caught my eye such as the shower for which the head was integrated into the ceiling, a personal Hamam for steaming and lastly the beautiful jacuzzi in the middle of the open plan suite.

Initially, we were excited to simply stay in the room and relax on the comfortable bed/sofa bed or lounge in our terrace in front of the sea. However, the sea is invitingly tempting. So we ended up walking to the hotel's private shore where there were attendants to fulfil your needs. However, I found there was a lack of ice cream in the shacks - perhaps just an unlucky visit.

We also visited the public indoor pool (outside was too cold) and it was perfect condition, clean, warm enough and free towels etc.

Food: Breakfast in the mornings was average, fresh orange juice, pancakes, eggs made to order, yoghurt, fruits etc - a wide selection...Needed for all the walking you need to do along the beach! Lunch in the beach restaurant is good but not amazing , free bread and olives and the pizza/peri chicken wrap were fresh and well flavoured. Lastly, the buffet did not look too appetising so we decided to go pure passion in the marina which is highly rated (highly recommend to go there for a fancy dinner). 

The weather was perfect at 27-30 degrees celsius which meant we did not require warm clothing. 

For a charming and relaxing ethos combined with a blend of European and Moroccan influences, I would recommend this hotel to couples."
"The highlight of this whole holiday was the stay in this magnificent hotel, the customer service is second to none, and every request catered for. 
The attention to detail and initial wow factor on arrival is quite staggering and also has a very welcoming and homely feel to it, helps of course with every staff member greeting you with ""ahlan wa sahlan, marhaban. Bonjour and salaam"" on passing in the corridors which gives you a real sense of culture too. 
Me my wife and 2 girls a 3 year old who turned 4 while there, and a 1 year old, felt right at home and has defanatly boosted there confidence since our stay here. 
A big thank you especially to ghizlan who from the day we arrived showed us around and took care of our ever need and want, we couldn't of asked for more and even organised for a yummy chocolate birthday cake be sent to my daughter in our room for her birthday which was literally the icing on the cake.
Again a huge thank you and gratitude to all the staff who made our first family holiday such a memorable expieance look forward to coming back next year on request of my daughter."
"We had a great experience with the staf and all of the personal in this hotel.
The service in the room was excellent, also the view out of the room.
We liked best the service and kindness of all the personal.
The hotel has a good swimming pool and very near bij the sea with a private beach, just excellent.

The stay in this hotel is the best we ever had experienced."
"stayed here for a week in October and from the moment we checked in we were given 100 % 5 star treatment from all staff , highly recommendable for a relaxing few days or weeks , great buffet breakfast to start the day and brilliant restaurant for dinner , lovely relaxing bar for cocktails or after dinner drinks with nightly entertainment , great outdoor pool and gym and spa treatments also available , overall a must if you want a peaceful relaxing get away ,keep up the good work all ! a big thank you and best wishes to Larby (hope  that's spelt correct) for his kindness and assistance during the week"
"Ok. So the hotel is beautiful and clean, very funky decor, although the architect could have allowed for a bit more light as it can be quite dark. The pool is lovely, the amazing selection of restaurants is great, and you can use all the facilities next door at the other Sofitel. The food is...just...amazing, I really couldn't fault any of the service, everything I could think of was done before I could even ask for it! Every time you pass a staff member they always greet you, it's lovely. Rooms are beautiful and very well sound proofed, every night a guy comes around asking if you want water or extra towels or anything, pool towels are already on the chairs by the pool and beach, you can have food brought to you anywhere, it's just beautiful. The spa is beautiful if a little expensive, but it's the best spa in the country apparently so they can get away with it haha! The indoor pool is magical, the water just feels amazing.  The view of the mountains is nice at night too. The only improvements I would make are the beach was a little dirty because of the public throwing rubbish and it being brought in and out with the tide (nearly stepped on a fish hook!), the entertainment in the evening could be better, and the food, if you aren't half or full board is very pricey. Although, for such good food, you wouldn't pay less at a nice place in London (about £50 for both of us). And also I would just advise the reception staff to check the names of the people staying in the room, I went with my boyfriend and they just assumed we were married and called him by my surname all week because the room was under my name!"
"Great hotel with wonderful pool and beach areas
All the management and staff looked after us superbly. Special mention to Concierge Mohammed,Receptionist Bouchra and Said who looks after everyone at the beach or around the pool.
Super restaurants in town, particularly "" Pure Passion"" at the Marina
      "
"luxurous and stylish rooms, very nice beach area with very clear water, nice for swimming
the whole hotel complex is in the best of taste,
phantastic restaurants, nice breakfast with a lot of local specialities
professional and very kind service"
"My wife and I have just returned from Agadir, this was our very first visit to Morocco and I was uncertain of where to stay. After finding Sofitel Thalassa spa online I was intrigued to read its reviews, Trip Advisor gave the most positive feedback for this hotel and I therefore decided to contact the operations manager Mr Enadifi by mail to discuss our trip. I have travelled the world extensively and have to say this was by far the most professional return of mail response I have ever experienced. My questions were answered immediately, constant mail was sent back and forth always a positive response always a professional courteous reply. The service in the hotel is exceptional the quality of the Food and Drinks are second to none and Mr Enadifi and his team of ambassadors  are by far the most professional and customer centric team I have come across. The hotel is clean, modern and stylish, the pool a wonderful size and the most comfortable sunbeds I have used in ages ! the private beach is wonderful, there is no crossing the promenade to get to this beach ! and the pool staff remain attentive from nine in the morning right the way through until six every evening . Nothing is too much trouble and there is more than enough staff to attend everybody's needs, the rooms are clean, the beds super comfortable and the hotel has a fantastic ambience in the evening with wonderful lighting around the pool area and beautifully manicured gardens. After walking the whole of the promenade and looking at other hotels as we went, this is by far without any contest the best hotel in Agadir. I will be returning next year and probably the year after as my wife and I come back with such fantastic memories and we have received a truly exceptional level of service from the hotel and its staff. I would like to personally thank Mr Enadifi for his constant assistance and professionalism and his staff which must be mentioned include Adil and Yancine in the restaurant and Jawad and Saied at the pool ,and I'm sure I will see you again when I return next year and wish you all continued success. "
"Overall a great place to stay. For us there was only one very negative thing: it's allowed to smoke everywere except for restaurant Market inside. People were smoking in restaurant L'Atlantique inside and also in the bar. 
We would suggest smoking area's. Also outside for breakfast. Half of the guests were smoking at breakfast, terrible, even though it was outside."
"No need to put down many words. This is one of these hotels where everything seems to go right. Wonderful rooms with superb views. Outstanding service overall - extremely well trained staff. Nice and trendy restaurants overlooking pool and gardiens.
I'd like to pay tribute to Mr. Ennadifi and his team, particularly Ghizlane (Guest service) and Ilham (breakfast restaurant) for their goodwill and professionalism. 
Thank you ladies for making this property so special .. where life is truly ""magnifique"" !"
"Top-notch facilities, amenities, staff, and service.  Quiet location -- we kept our balcony doors open to listen to the ocean waves.  Very spacious grounds and poolside area with plenty of lounge chairs and cabanas.  Super clean rooms and communal areas.  Comfy beds!  Lots of staff available for friendly assistance from early morning to late night.  On-site restaurants are knowledgeable of celiac and were able to accommodate my gluten free diet (some menu items even labeled 'GF').  A couple of minor issues regarding room amenities and a restaurant charge were addressed with courtesy and promptness.  We had a very nice stay here!"
"Relatively new modern hotel with beautiful well appointed lobbies and indoor spaces. Check in was slow and service in general was spotty. We had a 1 bedroom suite with pool and ocean views on the ground floor. The room was very comfortable and the sleep quality was excellent. Minor maintainence problems with room included burnt out light bulbs, telephone not plugged in, and jammed bathroom door. The pool is huge and the beach is very large and easily accessible. There were shaded beds around the pool and beach areas that really added to the comfort of the lounging experience, The restaurants were excellent with great food and service. The manager made up for the service inconvenience with a complimentary restaurant meal. Would definitely stay here again."
"Hotel was ridiculously beautiful and opulent. Direct access to a private beach, which has free canopy beds. We did not even need to get sandy! My husband and I were sick during our stay, and could not have imagined a better place to be sick. We lounged on the canopy beds by the beach, and ordered room service. We went to the buffet dinner the first night, which was expensive (about $50 per person).  The bed was wonderful and incredibly comfortable, and we had a beautiful deck with a great view. Free Wifi access was also good."
"I would recommend this hotel to anyone, Everyone is so charming, delightful staff who make your stay extra special. I was unwell for a couple of days, the staff where amazing and even dropped my friend to a chemist to get me some medicine. The sea front and promenade makes for a lovely evening walk. Little Norway is an excellent restaurant, the steak is to die for 😃. Last but not least if your shopping haggle for a bargain, it's truly friendly banter!!"
"We spent a week at  Sofitel, everything was manifique through the welcome, the room, the restaurant, the swimming pool also.
 i have Just a question : I plan to come back before end of the year , what is the interesting periode tout come knowing the change of climate in Agadir?

Thanks a lot ,,,

"
"Myself & my girlfriend stayed here after traveling around Morocco for 10 days.  We wanted to properly relax at the end of our holiday in Morocco.  The level of service from the staff is one of the best I have ever experienced, the staff were constantly friendly and helpful and really made you feel very welcome.  The staff were always on hand to help you no matter what and always smiled and had time for a quick chat to see how your stay was and if you needed any help.  Outside the hotel there is a promenade which goes along the beach the whole way into the central tourist area.  The breakfast in the hotel was the best I have experienced in any hotel, the selection and range of food was second to none.  The evening meals were pretty expensive and on par with what I am used to paying in London, but the standard was very good.  The pool area was excellent and the private beach area was also great.  The wifi was excellent throughout the hotel which was good for myself and my partner as we needed to check our work emails daily and this was a struggle in other hotels in Morocco.  We had a ground floor room which didn't have much of a sea view but had a great outside area to sit in the afternoon.  There was excellent music in the afternoons.  The beds are extremely comfortable and we are planning on buying the same bed for our home.   The room was very nice and they provided lots of treats in the room on arrival for free of charge.  I would definitely go back to this hotel if I was to return to Agadir.  The pictures don't do it enough justice as it is excellently looked after and the service is second to now.  When checking out we went to pay our room bill, I was just about to pay it when I noticed there were extra charges added to our bill and it turned out that someone else had charged evening meals to our room number costing about £80.  This was resolved instantly and then we settled the bill."
"I was sorry to read that previous travellers this month experienced some problems with repairs and training of new staff before the high season.  There was no evidence of any maintenance work when we arrived on 18th July or at any time during our stay.  If I owned an anorak no doubt I could find something to moan about. But I don't and I can't.  The important thing is if something is wrong just ask - don't wait till you have left.  Nothing is too much trouble for the staff.  My French is a bit rusty and we also used the few words of Arabic we knew which helps, but most of the staff spoke very good English.

I would like to reassure Brits, Europeans and Americans about the inevitable safety issue. We were happy to book this holiday recently as we already knew that Morocco is a very moderate Islamic state observing peace to all and with a long history of strong links to the West.  This proved to be the case more so than on previous trips.  The friendliness of the staff in the Sofitel Thalassa made everyone feel safe and welcome at all times.  Inconspicuous security guards added further reassurance.  Indeed a warm welcome was extended by everyone on our trips to Agadir town, no hassle whatsoever in the Souk or anywhere, just sincere friendliness.  Great respect from all locals towards ladies.  Many Europeans and Americans were walking the streets relaxed and smiling.  I'd honestly rate Agadir and as safe as you could be in London, Paris or New York - possibly even safer at the Sofitel Thalassa considering the large number of local VIPs and security staying at this hotel. 

The Sofitel Thalassa was the Moroccan hotel of the year in 2014, a title I have little doubt it will retain for 2015.   The setting with private beach is awesome.  The sun will tan you gently from mid-day until 7pm with a cool breeze.  Good surfing too, attentive  lifeguards in attendance all day.  We splashed out and upgraded to a pure sea view - room 172 - after reading other TA reviews: worth every penny (although pool view rooms do also look out to the sea too). See my photos for hopefully helpful orientation. If you are really flushed the room below us had a private pool which as you can see from my photographs provided a direct walk onto the beach and also some wonderful scenery lol ;).

Our room was immaculate with a monsoon shower and a very private balcony. Thanks to those famous Sofitel beds-with-best-toppers-in-the-world, we never made it to breakfast.  Continental breakfast in the room for 2 would feed 4!  Room service is excellent so you will want for nothing.  

The pool and beach area are stunning with plenty of sun-loungers and wonderful Souk beds and seating to afford privacy.  So much so the hotel did not seem busy with the 60% occupation it had while we were there.  The choice of good and varied restaurants was ample as you can eat next door at the Sofitel Royal Bay too.  There is also a really fantastic nightclub there.  The Atlantic restaurant next to the pool was our favourite with superb food.  Although we mainly ate Moroccan, I had the best tenderloin/filet mignon steak there in 25 years a couple of times.  No bad tummies here :).  

We had a nice massage at the Thalassa spa and you can have good value hamam and massage in town.  There is a wide choice and they will usually arrange a taxi for you.

The evening entertainment at the Thalassa was provided by the very talented and beautiful Canadian duo Lydia and Sebastien who, unfortunately for the hotel, are riding high in the Canadian charts and are about to sign with a major record label this autumn.  Bon chance! The beach parties were wonderful, with fire pits, drinks and food.  I've faced some dangerous times in the Indian and Malaysian jungles, parts of Europe and indeed London, so I'm very aware of my surroundings.  To demonstrate how safe and relaxed we were, we woke up at 5am one morning after a beach party on the hotel's private beach, having drifted off on a Souk bed as others did to the sound of waves replacing Lydia and Sebastien's dulcet tones.  With very few mosquitos, flies or wasps here this was a wonderful and peaceful experience.  And, of course, a security guard stayed discreetly a little way from us all the time we slept. That's 5 star care and treatment.

I have been in the vacation rental business for more than 10 years, so I mean it when I extend sincere thanks and congratulations to Mr Kamil, an Operations Director who takes hands on care of his guests, and to every single one of his staff too for making this a perfect holiday.  شكرا لك، وداعا ونراكم مرة أخرى"

My partner and I have just returned from a 10 day stay at this hotel, decor beautiful, and staff are all very friendly and helpful even if they did tend to assume we were French!! Rooms are lovely we stayed on the 2nd floor with a view overlooking the sea and pool, we were even offered free late checkout,

Hotel was very quiet due to Ramadan but this made our holiday even nicer as there was always a seat outside for breakfast (which was very good) and we never struggled to find a sun lounger, the guys at the pool even reserved the same loungers for us every day would just like to point out how lovely Danyel is very attentive but not intrusive and very polite and friendly young man!! 

Food at the hotel is very overpriced compared to other restaurants two in particular are definitely worth a visit little Norway and pure passion, however the one evening we did decide to eat at the hotel we were told for around £40 each we could have a buffet, and as the hotel is right at one end of the beach we decided to go for it however the food didn't look that appealing, a lot of it was cold we did arrive at 9pm ish but as we were paying around £60 for two meals (not including drinks) we thought it wouldn't be a problem, there was a language barrier and the chef couldn't tell us what the food was a French lady eating tried to help translate for us but we still had no clue what we were eating, and to make matters worse when we had eaten enough of the Hungarian cabbage (whatever that is) and so forth we went to get dessert and they had already cleared it away!! This is terrible service considering they could see we were still eating! However after mentioning it to a very nice member of management Ghizlane who had coincidentally given us some advice on near by shops etc on our first evening in the hotel, she came and sat with us to apologise and deducted one of the buffets from the bill, she too was a lovely member of staff and really made us feel welcome!! 

Water is supposed to be complimentary in your room every night however on 3 separate occasions we had to ask for water and this is not great considering it was 40 degrees outside! Also beware of the tourist tax when ordering at the hotel, 7% for your first order and 10% for your second and it's a unwanted surprise at the end when you go to check out!! 

The night before we left I noticed one of my MAC lipsticks was missing, it was brand new in the box as I brought it on the way from the airport however it had been taken out the box and just the box remained, we mentioned it when checking out but I wouldn't have thought been a 5 star hotel you would need to worry about your belongings!! 

Other than the incidents mentioned above we had an excellent stay here and would definitely return!

"Myself and my Husband stayed for 1 week at the end of June/beginning of July 2015 in the Sofitel Agadir Thalassa Sea & Spa. The hotel is located at the end of the main promenade, there is direct access to the nice sandy beach. We stayed in Room 12 which is on the ground floor with a garden view (it also had a partial sea view). The room was nicely appointed and maintained well. The pool area is lovely and during our time the hotel was not at all busy - so there was no problem with having our choice of sun lounger. On most days the pool staff would come around with a cooling amenity such as slices of water melon or a small smoothie - this was a welcome touch. 
The food and drink is expensive. For example, I ordered a non-alcoholic cocktail and was charged the equivalent of 13 euro (which is the same price as the alcohol cocktails!). Subsequently we ate out for dinner each evening as the hotel does not represent good value for money for meals etc. There are plenty of restaurants located a short (and cheap) taxi ride away. By the way the taxi men drive like maniacs so that is an adventure in itself!
It is true that the hotel is mostly geared for French visitors. However, we were always able to communicate with staff and get exactly what we wanted - it just sometimes took extra effort. 
From looking at the exteriors and some gardens/pool areas of other hotels within Agadir I would say that this hotel is by far the most recently built and luxurious. 
We did not visit the Spa so I can not comment on that. 
I would recommend this hotel for a romantic relaxing break in the sun."
"Hotel was very quiet (Ramadan Month). Only Market restaurant open in the evening, visited the next door Sofitel for lunch & dinner as the food can get repetitive after few days. Andellatif chef made a special dish for us on the last day which was great! Mohammad/Flor/Brahim service at dinners were very attentive but not too intrusive. Asma kept our room spotless & our requests were never too much for her. Mariam, at the front desk was always very helpful & gave us few very useful suggestions. Without Ghizlan's help in sorting out out issues, we would be at a lost - Very efficient Guest Relation!
In all very relaxing , spotless & well maintain hotel just need a bit more variety for breakfast & lunch!
Big thanks again & will definitely be back."
"We stayed at the hotel last November for 10 days and loved it, so much so that we booked it for our honeymoon in April / May of this year. After the last stay my wife wrote a tripadvisor review in which she said that we would be back, but pointed out a ""chipped sink"".

This was our second stay at Sofitel Agadir Thalassa Sea & Spa and we had high hopes as it was our honeymoon, but things didn't get off to a great start. Ironically we arrived when the hotel was full as it was Labour Day (week) in France, similar to our May Bank Holidays; more about this later. We were given the same room (007) and my wife was horrified to see that not only had the sink not been repaired, but it had gained a second one. The shower door was virtually hanging off and we later found out the grab rail was insecure.

We raised the damage to the room immediately and were told that we would be moved as soon as possible to a new room. We saw the Operation Director, Kamil, that evening, who recognised us from our last stay. He was mortified to hear about the room and arranged for repairs to be undertaken the next morning at our convenience and bought us a drink.

This should have been the end of the matter, but it wasn't as the maintenance team arrived earlier than agreed. When we returned the sink had been repaired but the shower rail and door were not properly repaired.

At this stage I complained and the hotel agreed to move us to a new room, which should have been easy, but when things are working against you they go from bad to worse. Locked out of our room, no help moving rooms, etc

When Kamil heard about what had happened we were upgraded to a suite, but by this time we were three days into a ten day honeymoon.

It has to be said the local staff (aka Moroccan) are fantastic, although they struggled with English as a third / fourth language, but that;s our fault for not speaking very much French. Kamil was brilliant as were the team in the bar, especially Jasmine, but the restaurant staff were off hand (not the Atlantic).

The staff made our first week anniversary very special with a bottle of champagne, flower petals and candles in our room.

However, sad to say when we got back to the UK my wife discovered one of her dresses was missing, we reported it to the hotel, who looked for it, but said they couldn't find it. I have to say that we think the dress was removed from the room, which was a sad end to the holiday.

I have stayed at Accor hotels worldwide and whilst the hotel was what you would expect from Accor (especially Sofitel), it has to be said they aren't maintaining the rooms very well. Even the suite was showing ware and tear."
"We spent 10 days of our honeymoon at this hotel and I have to say that it was an experience of a lifetime. From the moment we arrived Radjid and staff made sure our every need was met. We were upgraded to a presidential suite which was even more luxurious than we could have imagined. I had read complaints about the hotel decor being dark but to me it just added to the thalassa/spa feel and was very cooling when coming in from the sun. Pool area is large and well attended with view of the sea and private beach.
Re wheelchair access: overall the hotel is pretty perfect with ramps & adapted bathrooms in public areas. Can't review the accessible room as ours was a suite and there was ample space with roll-in shower. WC was a little tight but again this was not an adapted room.

I can't say enough about the staff - Brahim, Zaccariah and Fouad (in the bar) took particular care of us, delivering top class service. 

Also, the entire hotel is spotlessly clean.

If I was to nitpick, I would say of the area; along the beachfront is extremely quiet. Not many bars/restaurants which meant we ate in the hotel every night. This worked out expensive but we didn't mind so much as it was our honeymoon. 

In short, this was luxury, grandeur and service at it's best. Go there, go there now:)"
"Very difficult to locate the hotel. However once we found it we were astounded by the front view of the hotel. The staff greeted us on arrival and offered complimentary mint tea and biscuits which were greatly needed due to the long travel from the UK.  Hotel staff very friendly.  Room neat and tidy with a fantastic view to the pool. Buffet breakfast had lots of options, even included an selection for dieters.  Drawbacks: Lots of flies and birds flying into the breakfast area so very off putting particularly when choosing fresh fruit options and breads/cheeses. However fresh omelettes and doughnuts made up for this. Would definitely recommend if considering staying in Agadir. You won't be disappointed."
"Let me take this opportunity to thank the staff for their warmth and friendliness. As you enter the beautiful hotel grounds we were warmly welcomed and this set the tone for the rest of our stay. The hotel wasn't particularly busy during Ramadam so there was no drama finding places for breakfast or dinner in any of the many places to eat on site or at its sister establishment just next door. As I sit down to wow my friends on Social media it occurred to me to first ""Give unto Ceaser"" and write a review. Nothing seemed to be to much trouble. If we had to contact another establishment the reception was quite happy to ring and translate for us. Considering that we visited during this Holy month the staff were firing on all cylinders. Thank you, again."
"Although Agadir has been playing its role as Morocco's premier coastal resort for a long time, it still seems to lack the necessary hospitality culture, that Marrakesh seems to have achieved.  The Thalassa Sea & Spa is the newer of 2 Sofitels in the Founty tourist hotel sector at the far end of the Corniche, which isolates it somewhat from the promenade's activities.  Decoration is modern and quite design, though somewhat dark.  Despite its 2 years in operation, the infrastructure already shows signs of wear.  The deluxe rooms are unacceptably small for a hotel of this standard and in this location.  The cushions on the terrace were dirty.  Breakfast room is pleasant and the offerings are at western (French) level.  The swimming pool are and the beach are extended and well equipped.  Restaurant Atlantique is recommended for lunch.  Prices are at European level.  The Thalassa is a reason to stay at the hotel (keep in mind that Agadir is not that interesting as destination and often plagued by a persistent 'mist') and is at par with the French thalassothérapies with a slight Oriental touch.  Impressive wet part.  Special thanks to Layla at Thalasso reception.  Complimentary yoga sessions can be interesting.  Service is generally lacking and uninterested.  Special thanks however to Layla at Hotel reception for her efforts in retrieving lost property.  All in all property with potential, but room for improvement and need for maintenance."
"We enjoyed the stay at Sofitel Thalassa very much. Special thanks to Amine - the pool guy - who was very friendly, helpful and had excellent recommendations. Although the facilities are outstanding and the location is awesome (soft and sandy beach), unfortunately the food quality and bar service is not worth the money. Cocktails can be way better, waiters at the bar are seldom attentive and the quality of the lunch/dinner in all restaurants has not met our expectations (except for breakfast).

As we were able to work around the food and waiter issue (by having dinner and drinks outside) we can definitely recommend to stay there."
"My husband and I stayed for 6 nights at the end of May, and we had a fantastic time! We stayed at the Sofitel Thalassa Sea and Spa, but we were also allowed to go across to the Sofitel Royal Bay Resort which is much more lively ( particularly in the evenings!) in contrast to the serene and peaceful environment of the Thalassa hotel. The decor is very slick and contemporary and we could see people constantly cleaning and mopping so it was very clean! The house keeping was outstanding- it was always lovely to have our room adorned with rose petals and the sheets arranged decoratively 😊 Our room had a large balcony with a partial sea view, a very comfortable and warm bed, and an amazing rain shower. Although the open plan of the room ( clearly designed for couples) was very romantic, the decor was dark with little natural light. We had a free bottled water and tea supplied which was great as we had been a bit worried about the drinking water. 
The hotel pool was the perfect place to relax in the sun and enjoy a refreshing swim. Lastly, there were a number of restaurants of a variety of cuisines within both hotels, and the food was superb. 
Although the staff were very friendly and accommodating, the service was a little slow occasionally, possibly due to the language barrier, which made ordering hotel room service slightly difficult at times as we would not always get exactly what we ordered ( I ordered English tea one morning and received mint tea instead!) Considering it is a five star hotel, we would expect impeccable and prompt service but overall we had an amazing time and would definitely return."
"This 5* hotel is a perfect mix of Moroccon authenticity and western comfort. Although we had some issues at the check-in (our double-door family room wasn't available so we had to sleep with the children on our room the first night). In short, you don't always get what you've been promised by hotel personel, athough they were very friendly.
Food was magnificent."
"We initially booked six days in Essaouira, but on the first day decided we didn't need that much ""real"" (ie surly & mysogynistic) Morocco, so made a late booking for the Sofitel Thalassa in Agadir. True, this stylish & contemporary hotel could have graced a resort anywhere, but decor was very impressive, showcasing art by a Moroccan artist Alain Gerez, with a fabulous pool area of truly monumental scale. Nice breakfast and evening cocktails, and good service round the pool, all as reasonable prices. Deluxe room fairly small but nicely appointed (we did book late and had a discounted deal), with pleasant outdoor area, though bedding seemed overly soft and lack of an in-room movie option seemed remiss for a 5* hotel. We liked the big silver cushions in the bar so much we wanted to buy some, so if Sofitel can let us know would be appreciated !"
"Hotel is very clean and comfortable.  A lot of staff to make your stay comfortable.  Restaurants are nice with reasonable price for buffet.  Not a big choice of food for a child (not many soups, potato dishes, etc), but still there is a possibility to fond smth.
Hotel is not crowded which is good.  Nice beach with security and staff always at your disposal.
Rooms(deluxe) are a little bit small for a family but perfect for a couple.  Ocean view is very nice and romantic."
"Upon arrival to the hotel you are greeted with amazing views of the hotels grand frontal entrance and escorted to a gorgeous seating area where you are handed tea and biscuits. You are then taken to your room in an courteous fashion. All the staff are extremely welcoming, friendly and attentive from the start to finish. If you have any queries or communication barrier issues, I recommend just going to the reception area or asking for Brahim. He is the room service assistant and loves to solve any problems and make guests feel at home.

Asked staff for personalised cocktail and they went out their way to provide it to my requirements and taste! Very specific! Asked for every single ingredient I want :) so I showed a picture and vwalla strawberry daiquiri frozen with lime, lemonade and a teeny splash of rum! But you can just go up to the bar in the restaurant next to the pool and they make specialised cocktails. The bar inside near reception also has a great selection of drinks! 

The nightclub (so lounge) is a really cool place! It is in the sister hotel next door which is only a 2minute walk (if that) to get to. They have live bands on which are really good fun and the atmosphere is top! Just watch out on those stairs! lol

The Moroccan restaurant is my favourite place to eat! The staff are so elegant and the whole environment is lush, chic, modern and relaxing. 

The toilets situated to the right of the pool entrance are very dark and ladies be warned, if you didn't feel drunk before entry, it is certain you will be wibbly wobbling between three parallel lines when you exit. Hahaha!

Nearby is a local supermarket named Marjan. I would suggest going here to purchase any extra items you may require throughout the duration of your stay. It is like Asda. 

There is a really cool zoo to visit which is conveniently located next to a mcdonalds and an English pub! It does get very congested in this area, so if you are visiting with children I suggest keeping a sharp eye on them. 

There is an amazing taxi driver who has asked me to put his number online I would suggest you use this guy he is fantastic! 00212676841963 Taxi driver named Rashid. Great prices and very welcoming. He has a lot of information on where to go. 

Conveniently located nearby is a massage parlour which charges only 500d/£33 for a two hour session which consists of 1 hour in the hamman with chocolate exfoliation and 1 hour relaxing massage. They will pick you up from your hotel and take you back. The telephone for this is +212 528 21 51 51 and also the email is contact@arga-souss.com

I had an amazing holiday! I travelled alone and was made to feel very safe, peaceful and happy! I would definitely go back!"
"We stayed in the Royal Bay hotel next door, but we did book the spa here and found that experience nice.

My husband had a really nice massage.  Unfortunately during my massage the CD player broke.  Also, she apparently forgot to put the pads on my eyes and strangely during the massage I would occasionally smell rotten eggs.  

The girl who did my massage was lovely and otherwise the experience was nice.  I think that she was thrown with the music player bring broke that she forgot to do everything during my massage."
"My boyfriend and I stayed here from April 18-25. The hotel is exquisitely beautiful and everyone pleasant to deal with, from the mint tea and macaroons on arrival to the turn down service.

My only gripe was the fact that I had one of my expensive work dresses go missing from the hotel room. As we had left all our clothes in a heap at the corner of the room, only packing prior to checkout, this was only discovered just before we had to leave for the airport. I emailed Mr Abdelatif to remind him to check for my dress and no result, housekeeping had no idea where it had gone. No word from the hotel with regards to compensation either.
I am just shocked that in such a 5 star establishment you can't trust them, and that you have to be careful about your belongings in your room. It left such a bitter bitter taste in our mouths at the end of what was otherwise a lovely holiday."
"A fantastic 5 star hotel, I enjoyed the visit over a bank holiday weekend. The staff are friendly and very welcoming the facilities in the hotel are well maintained and has a wow factor throughout the hotel. 
The rooms are very stylish with a deep comfortable bed and magnificent shower. 
The beach and pool area is very good plenty of places to relax and chill out in the Agadir sun.
Overall thoroughly enjoyed the visit and would recommend this hotel if your visiting Agadir."
"The check in was late more than an hour and the customer relations manger Sara was very rude and unpolite. But thanks to Mr. Kamil Ennadifi he made our stay very nice and remember able it was the best hotel for our fifth wedding anniversary all the staff were nice friendly tidy. The food was great. We are very happy
Thank you so much "
"What a wonderful hotel to arrive at. It looks stunning inside and out and the staff were the most courteous and friendly staff you could wish for. 
The pool and beach areas are lovely. Well maintained and spotlessly clean. The staff at the pool were attentive and helpful providing more towels than we could want and parasols when needed. Particular praise for Danyiel - what a charming and polite young man. Also Abrahadim (spelling?) also a blue shirted pool boy.  We were on a room only basis but did eat at the pool a couple of times - delicious. Harissa olives were the best. The main bar is gorgeous and a wonderful place  to sit inside or out. Our rooms 210 and 206 - superior rooms I think - not the most spacious of hotel rooms but nicely finished with very comfy beds and a great shower. Side view of sea and up the promenade which I liked. Small veranda with comfy chairs to watch sun set. Housekeeping was good with small bottles of water delivered each evening. Water in the hotel is very expensive even compared to UK. Local shops sell it for a tiny fraction of the cost. The concierge and reception staff were delightful. Encouraging of our daily forays out and evening adventures and keen to hear how we had fared! They were very helpful and Iike all  the staff unfailingly professional. Special mention for Abdellatif - what a wonderful smile and Oussame for patience at check out. We had a couple of discrepancies on bill which were sorted immediately with no fuss.  We were on room only and the hotel is expensive as you would expect so we did venture out for breakfast (The Oasis - few mins walk up the promenade) 60 dirham for lovely spread. We found some lovely local restaurants and I feel it is good to put some money into the local economy.  I say this not to knock the hotel I say it in the hope that people will definitely stay here and also go out and about.
Alcohol is expensive here as you would expect however if you like a really good gin and tonic or margarita have it here in the hotel. Beautifully made and served. We tried out and about but nothing compared.
The beach is beautiful with crashing Atlantic rollers and I felt perfectly safe and relaxed walking on my own in the early morning. Agadir isn't the best of Morocco in terms of architecture and history etc however for a break in the sun it ticks the boxes and this hotel is the place to stay.  We were four 50 something women on a girly break and would we return absolutely yes. A little bit of heaven!"
"Beautiful décor,good food choice options, daily water delivered in room, welcome fruit and cakes, good beach and tidy hotel, big pool and spa are the marks of this hotel. wonderful experience staff very friendly and well recommended."
"I read the reviews on Trip before we booked and was delighted to see for myself how amazing our stay at the Thalassa was.  From the smart, professional staff, to the chefs cooking breakfasts to your taste (the omlettes were delicious), to the care and attention to the grounds, rooms and private beach area.  Although we are from the UK, there was plenty of opportunity to use basic french and the staff were sympathetic to our challenges and made the experience fun.  The jazz player in the main bar on our first night was absolutely fantastic.  It was hard to think of anything this hotel did not do incredibly well - the only area was that on our last night (19th April) a customer in the restaurant started smoking - something we had not seen previously.  We had finished our meal and there wasn't anyone sitting near the couple - but it was unusual.  We walked into Agadir to eat once - but stayed in the main hotel for all our meals - as there wasn't anywhere that had the same level of quality and service.  The tourist part of Agadir is nothing you would not expect - but not to our tastes.  Thank you - we will return to this hotel."
"This was my first beach type holiday in Morocco and it was wonderful. We had 6 days of thalassotherapy which was heavenly. The staff at the centre were excellent and the treatments truly everything we had dreamed of. The pool area was also well planned with comfortable beds and lots of shade. Here too the staff was efficient and there were always plenty of towels and someone to find you a bed.Added to that it was a hop, skip and a jump to the beach which was also very pleasant. We came for a rest but for those who want more the hotel organises plenty of activities and there is a club for children. We were a little disappointed with the room which we thought was small for a superior king size and it was just on the point of getting to be a little shabby. However, the beds were comfortable and we really enjoyed the mood lights in the shower. The balcony was also a plus feature and we enjoyed relaxing  there in the evenings. We ate in two restaurants and both were excellent. The Market menu changed each evening and the fish, meat and vegetables can all be recommended. The staff in the Market were exceptionally kind and greeted us each day by name. We did not use the bar but the entertainment seemed to be very good. Can we recommend this hotel? Yes and try to visit the thalassotherapy centre as it is truly worth it."
"Just a few weeks ago I returned from my first visit to Morocco.  In another review, I will tell you about how exquisite I found Morocco to be.  Morocco is heaven on earth. 

Sofitel Sea and Spa is a convenient ride from the airport.  The moment I walked into this property I drifted away into a sense of peace and calm.  Omar, Guest Service (expert!) person, greeted me and never left my side until I left.  As a matter of fact, he left me a note, in the event that I left while he was not on duty!  

The property opens out to a breathtaking vista of beach and the North Atlantic ocean.  The constant breeze off of the ocean moves through the hotel giving one the sense of gliding.  

The room that I occupied for my three nights was heavenly.  Nicely sized, a sensational bathroom, and a view of the pools.  The room was immaculate and maintained perfectly during my brief stay.

The hotel bar, Le Medecine Bar Soir, is s a great gathering place.  We met there nightly, enjoyed cocktails and then moved on from there. The entertainment in the bar was exceptional.

I plan on taking friends and family back to Morocco as soon as possible.  As for where I will stay while in Agadir, there is not even a question, Sofitel Sea and Spa!  

When you arrive at Sofitel Sea and Spa, please give Omar my best.  

Safe Travels, Colin"
"Great place to stay, rooms very clean and well planned, the bed is so comfortable, balcony large with nice view of the beach & mountains of agadir.
Hotel decor & facilities outstanding.
Staff are very helpful and friendly made me feel very welcome.
             "
"Hello! I will apologize in advance because this will be a long review but what I have to say should be important to ANY traveler. My sisters, brother in law and I visited the Sofitel Thalassa Sea & Spa in March 2015 and we were absolutely amazed at the level of service and treatment from the staff there- 10 STARS! Let me begin by saying the staff at the reception/lobby; Nora, Bouchra, Abdelillah, Zakaria, Badr, Nourdine, Omar, Amyal, Basha, Moumou etc. (there were quiet a few), were all extremely welcoming with huge smiles and great professionalism. 
I was in charge of finding a hotel for the family members we went with and I read several reviews about the Sofitel (which is the new one) and decided it would be a perfect fit. Unfortunately,  I accidentally booked a different one on booking.com and a coupe of people at the reception (around 3:00 PM on March 2, 2015) helped me contact the other hotel in order to attempt to cancel the reservation. (TALK ABOUT GOING ABOVE YOUR JOB DUTIES)! We got a tour of the hotel, choices on the rooms (based on view) and then we settled in. 
My sister and I stayed in room 065 and the next day we were fortunate enough to meet Khadijah.... What a humble, caring, lovely person. I don't want to call her our ""housekeeper"" or the ""cleaning lady"" but at this point she's become a friend. I came across her several times throughout our 2 week stay and got to know her through casual conversations and it amazed me how passionate she was about doing her job. Allah yahfedha! In addition, our turn down service by Ibrahim was beautiful (I love his flower designs). Khadijah was always smiling and happy. They say IN ORDER TO BE HAPPY IN LOVE YOU MUST DO SOMETHING YOU LOVE, and while she may want something better for her future, she is THANKFUL she can work and because she's thankful, she's GREAT at her daily duties. Thank you Khadijah for ensuring our room was beautiful and clean daily! You made us feel at home. 
We also really appreciated the Lifeguard, Youssef for going above his job in ensuring our comfort at the pool and once again great service!
And although this may not mean much to some of you, we seemed to have an issue with our lights and were immediately taken care of by Saiid and then Jalal (thank you both so much!)

NOW, LET'S TALK ABOUT THE EVENING AMANE BAR STAFF: Rachid, Fatima, Larbi, Achraf, Fouad, Salim, Mohammed, Omar, Jihane and Sanae.  WOW! They are the most welcoming, kindest, humble, professional, sweetest group of staff I have EVER come across throughout my traveling experiences. Some of you may read this and this ""Oh wow how many places have you even visited?"" I HAVE BEEN TO QUIET A FEW HOTELS THROUGHOUT MY LIFE AS I COME FROM A FAMILY THAT LOVES TO TRAVEL BUT YESSSS THE FACT IS THIS TOPS ALL OF THEM! The Amane Bar Staff are just precious and it  shows in their service, professional attitude, politeness and gestures. The great drinks, quick timing, table displays, etc. made us NOT want to go to any other bar in Agadir. (I'm sure you'll surprised by that!) But I AM MOROCCAN AND I AM SO PROUD OF THE HOSPITALITY MY PEOPLE DISPLAY NOT JUST TO THEIR FELLOW MOROCCANS BUT TO ALL GUESTS (EUROPEANS, AMERICANS, CANADIANS, ETC.) And what really made my jaw drop is their response to some of the clients at the bar (You know, the rude guests who unfortunately aren't happy no matter what the level of service is). I have seen the Amane Bar staff deal with certain clients who were extremely unpleasant and yet they still smiled and said ""oui monsieur or oui madamme"". Larbi and Rachid, I commend you for your patience and professionalism. MY HAT GOES OFF TO YOU! And normally we don't get too personal but we wrote a thank you letter to each of the Amane Bar staff members a thank you letter with a rose and a heart-shaped keychain because they have big hearts and we wish them continued success (A diploma of excellent service).
And yes of course THE AMENITIES, THE VIEWS, THE FOOD ARE ALL GREAT WHICH MAKES THIS A 5 STAR BUT THE SERVICE IS WHAT TAKES IT ABOVE ANY OTHER 5 STAR! 
To the management, as I am sure you are aware you simply cannot please everyone but please do  a favor to those of us who had a lifetime experience with the above individuals in thanking your staff for the EXCEPTIONAL JOB THEY DO ON A DAILY BASIS because as we say in arabic (Hamro likoum lawjah). We cannot wait to return and see our home away from home! God bless!!"
"We read the reviews and we were not disappointed. Beautiful décor, huge pool and spa. Vast choice of food spoilt for choice. Rooms came with robe and slippers, complimentary water delivered to your room daily. The fruit and cakes were a nice touch on arrival so were the complimentary smoothies by the pool. The hotel was spotless and the beach cleaned daily. You can walk along the beach or the promenade to bars and restaurants or take a taxi anywhere in Agadir for £1.50. Visited end of March , ample sunbeds with towels provided. Surprised to see the breakers and surfers on the beach. Lovely pleasant staff. Had no trouble accessing the Free WIFI. Our only comment is that as in England if you go to 5* hotel expect 5* Bar Prices."
"Had a week here recently with our adult son and found it everything we were hoping for. There are minor things which could irritate but overall we had an enjoyable stay. We don't like the bright lights and crowds so the location at the end of the promenade was ideal.

Our two rooms were next to each other which was great and although we never saw the in house cleaners the rooms were kept clean and beds made efficiently and any request we left was met. The internal decor was a bit on the dark side but that is the way it is - despite the colour it was in good order. The lights in the room all worked but every day was a new experience in trying to work out which switch worked which light(s)!

Beds were really comfortable and we were on the ground floor and the recessed terrace opening to the garden was a lovely and unusual benefit - especially when we had adjoining rooms.

Breakfasts were plentiful and with a wide choice of cold or cooked food. The staff were very helpful and friendly and most spoke, or made an attempt, to speak English. If we had one gripe about our stay it was the sparrow(s) flying into the Breakfast Room, sitting on the bread and cake counter and pecking away at the bread. 

We only drank occasionally in the bar as there were lots of local restaurants to enjoy in the evenings. Whilst prices were high compared to local tavern/pub rates they were no more expensive than most 5 star hotels anywhere.

We had trips organised by our tour company which were OK but on our final day the Sofitel arranged for the 3 of us to have our own driver and vehicle for a comprehensive tour of the hinterland. We left at 8am and returned at 7.30pm and all for less than £45 per head - we felt that was excellent value for money.

All in all a very comfortable, relaxing and enjoyable stay and although it's unlikely that we will return to Agadir we certainly will look at the Sofitel range elsewhere if its an option and suits our plans."
"Stayed for 4 nights with a friend. Was told we would get a vip welcome this did not happen not sure why but they did seem busy with a bridal photo shoot unfortunately. If your french this hotel is totally kitted out for you. If your English it is not. The spa which was lovely only had the treatment list in French which actually prevented us from booking more treatments. The staff in the spa were outstanding. Laila, habiba  always greeted
Is with beautiful smiles and couldn't have been more helpful. But FATIMA was s shining star for this sadly lacking in service hotel. She was just fantastic. The hammam treatment and massage was outstanding. Highly recommend having it. The Moroccan restaurant was lovely and katia was superb with advice and service. The atlantique was dull and lacking in atmosphere although the lady serving us was trying to hard bless her. Breakfasts were ok and le market for dinner was ok for buffet food. We waited an hour for anyone to offer a drink when sat around the pool and actually asked 3 times before it came. Rooms were lovely and nicely situated. A walk along the promenade to o playa for lunch is a must. Beach nice at the hotel but bit dirty further down. Would return and hopefully find it not quite to French! "
"We stayed at the Sofitel Agadir Thalassa Sea & Spa for one week with our baby (6 months old). The hotel itself is amazing and you can see that there are huge efforts to keep everything tidy and clean. Furthermore most of the employees are extraordinarily caring - like Ilham who made each of our breakfasts a great time.

There is only little room for improvement. In the mornings the gym was most times not in a decent condition and some individual mistakes should not happen like staff opening the door to our room by midnight.

I can very much recommend to stay at the Sofitel Agadir Thalassa Sea & Spa which is very likely the best hotel in Agadir and one of the best hotels I have visited yet."
"There are no words to describe our recent visit to the Sofitel Agadir Thalassa Sea & Spa. From the minute we arrived, till the last second we departed. The staff and the service were exceptional. My business partners and I felt as if we were home away from home. From the doormen to the front reception and the lobby, every single employee greeted us with a big smile. Noura, Bouchra, Moumou, Badr, Nourdine, Omar, Amyal, Basha, along with others are all wonderful and very helpful. I don't even know where to begin to describe their great attitude and warm hospitality. At night time, we went to Amane Bar where we were greeted and served by the world's most professional and kindest people. Fatima, Rachid, Fouad, Salim, Larbi, Achraf, Sanae, Youssef, Omar, and Jihane the bar supervisor who all went beyond their assigned duties to make us as comfortable and relaxed as they possibly could.  Although sofitel Royal Bay is known to have a better atmosphere than Thalassa Sea & Spa, the staff at Amane bar what makes Amane bar, we refused to go to any bar other than Amane because we felt as if we were at home with friends and family. We literally cried when we were saying bye to the staff, and they made it impossible for us to forget their beautiful smiles and their great service. ******************. these are the stars earned by Amane bar.  My business partners and I have decided to write each and everyone's name that we came in contact with to recognize them for their excellent service and professionalism. If you want to feel the breeze and hear the sound of the ocean, just go to the pool where you would find just about anything, from bars, restaurants, cabanas, and comfortable lounge chairs to finding Youssef :) the lifeguard who went out of his way to make us feel comfortable. He even made us a natural suntan oil from Pure Argan and lemon, and there were days when he would reserve certain seats for us with beautiful flowers, magazines to read and towels. Youssef is so adorable that I wanted to shove him in my suitcase and bring him with us :). The view from our rooms were breathtaking. Room 065 had a pool and a mountain view, and room 064 had some ocean and sand mountain view that made it feel as if we were in some sahara desert. But that's not all, both khadijas from the housekeeping department and Ibrahim, kept our rooms immaculate and always put rose petals on the bed, and at night time, we would always find cookies and lit candles, and the sheets overturned. Ibrahim surprised us almost every night using his creativity and talent to write messages on the entrance of our rooms with rose petals. We actually always wondered what he was going to do the next night as if we were playing some guess game. one day he spelled our last name, the next day he wrote another message saying sisters for life. Then we met said and Jalal the electricians who came to our room to fix an issue we had with a light in our restroom that went off two times. They took care of the issue the minute we put in a service request and every time we ran into one of them they would ask if there was anything else they can do to make us comfortable. To anyone traveling to Morocco, I highly recommend this place and I promise you that you will have an unforgettable experience. As a Moroccan/American, I'm so proud of our beloved country and its people. On behalf of my business partners and I, we would like to extend our great appreciation to all the staff that made our stay an unforgettable one. We hope to see you all in a month or so, and you guys have set the bar so high for us that when we stayed in Casablanca at another 5 start hotel prior to our return to the state, we realized that its impossible for us to return to Morocco and not go to Agadir and more specifically Sofitel. Much love and respect to the Sofitel staff. 

Loubna"
"Very stylish hotel in a great beach front location. Comfort and luxury all the way.
Great room with good facilities, excellent breakfast and a great choice of dinning - but really no need to look beyond ""The Market"" which offered a spectacular choice at its buffet.
Pool facilities and service were first class.
Strolling along the beach was a joy - 30mins or so down to the marina with lots to see along the way. Excellent and very helpful staff.
This hotel thoroughly deserves its top rating."
"Had an amazing time staying in Sofitel Hotel. Agadir experience wouldn't have been great without staying at this hotel. Service from all staff was 5* especially by Driss for our everyday service during Breakfast, lunch and dinner. Nida for our room service, Momo for his hospitality and all the staff by the pool side. Also Karim for his extra service during our evening stay ☺️ 
I would recommend everyone to book yourself a room at this hotel! "
"One of the top end sofitels. It is beautiful. Very modern decor and charming staff. Has an amazing spa. Pool area is very calm and relaxed environment. Plenty of areas for sun and shade. The beach terrace is fab!!! 
Food is excellent tho quite pricey but only to be expected given  nature of hotel. "
"We spent a week in early February at this great hotel booked through Secret Escapes on a half board basis. The hotel is modern, comfortable and stylish without being off-putting. The service was very good and the buffet breakfasts and themed evening meals offered excellent quality and choice. The staff were welcoming, helpful and very professional. The heated outdoor pool and 'four poster bed' sun loungers were ideal. The hotel is at the end of Agadir's paved promenade and it was a 30-40 minute pleasant stroll to the Marina at the opposite end. Midway were small bars / restaurants for a cheap mid-day snack.  Keep an eye out for the hotel's daily news sheet as this gave notice of a cocktail making class, a Moroccan wine tasting session and The Manager's cocktail evening all of which we enjoyed. Bottled water free of charge delivered to the room daily. We went pre-season so the hotel was quiet which suited us. Also the daily temperatures were (for me) a reasonable 20-25 degrees. Hotel drink prices are not cheap but you are in a 5 Star hotel. A little French helps but all the main staff do speak English.  We would definitely recommend this hotel and hope to return."
"The heading sums up our week, booked through Secret Escapes on half board basis. The hotel is very modern and comfortable, the location over looking the Ocean is first class (we spent ages just watching the waves) and on half board basis we ate in the buffet restaurants (you can use the one next door too) and I have to say I thought both excellent, with plenty of variety. The last night we ate in the Moroccan restaurant which was fabulous. For sure this is not a family style resort which is why we loved it, not wanting to have children running around everywhere, but for a relaxing winter sun get away, we enjoyed the hotel, Agadir and Morocco enormously."
"Just returned from a wonderful mainly sunny week in Agadir, some misty early mornings. The facilities at the hotel leave nothing to be desired. Exceptionally comfortable rooms carefully tended twice a day. The large heated swimming pool, excellent gym and sea walks were all necessary to combat our over indulgence of the excellent meals. This hotel is truly five star but we think it deserves an extra star for the fabulous staff. Sara (guest relations) and every member of the various teams made our visit such a pleasure."
"I have now spent three Midterm breaks in this hotel. Very well managed, Thank you Mr. Kamil Ennadifi,  Brahim in Room Service wonderful, Executive Chef in Seafood restaurant catered to my dietary needs, superb food. great trainer in gym. A wonderful experience."
" An absolute shag pad of a room with an open shower with one way glass looking over the bed and thence the balcony.  They had really thought about the detail and got it right.
The food was great and the service of the high standard expected. The pool bar does a good lunch, although avoid the fish carpaccio. Not sure what happened there; could have been a thinly sliced fish, could just have been the contents of its stomach. Have the steak. It was a monster. 
The site backs onto the beach, and is on the southern end of the beachside promenade so you can step straight onto either. "
"The Sofitel Thallasa is right at the other end of the beach from the Marina, and consequently it’s very quiet.  This obviously appeals to rich, middle-aged French couples, who make up about three-quarters of the clientele.  This is not a hotel to come to if you want poolside entertainment, if you expect your kids to be looked after by someone else, or if you want nightlife, although I think these are available at the Sofitel Royal Bay next door.  

The gardens are nicely kept, and they (and the hotel) sit around with a square pool.  This was allegedly heated, but was still pretty cold in February.  The Atlantic is just a few metres away, but very rough and only for surfers.  The pool is surrounded by the usual loungers and shaded four-poster beds, and towels were plentiful.  The hotel has a good gym (at least, good for cardio) and an undoubtedly good but expensive spa.  If you want a good value massage, go to a local hammam (we recommend Malak).

The buffet (‘The Market’) was the usual venue for your evening meal if you are on half-board, and had excellent salads and a range of hot food, and if that doesn’t suffice, it has a pizza oven in the corner.  I’ve had better food in hotels, but never better desserts – the patissier here is awesome.  We also ate at the Moroccan-themed restaurant (which did a really good set meal for £35 including wine, with wonderful local musicians) and the Atlantic fish restaurant (which is good, but expect £60 each including wine – and no discounts for half-boarders, by the way).  You can also use the restaurants in the Royal Bay.  The breakfasts, again in the Market, are varied and superb, with a special shout-out to the Moroccan lute player, who we loved.

While the food is good, my one gripe, and the reason that they almost lost a star, was the choice and price of drinks.  I did not appreciate paying Dh 60 (£4+) for a bottle of water or a small bottle of beer (choice of two). The wine list featured bottles of Moroccan wine at £30 to £40, which they were definitely not worth.  Cocktails were typically £8+.  All of which is pretty outrageous, but Sofitel saved the star by providing (at no notice at all) a birthday cake for my wife’s 60th.

The staff are all well-trained, excellent, attentive and polite.  Most of the senior staff speak English, but as you are in French hotel in a French-speaking country having a least a few words of that language will prove helpful.

We had a ‘luxury’ room, unfortunately facing a road.  As you enter there is a small dressing area and toilet cubicle, then an open-plan shower and washing area, then the bedroom (with TV and Bose sound system) and a large patio. The wifi is free, and although it is slow it works consistently provided you re-register every three days.  The shower, so often a cause of complaints in hotels, was excellent with Grohe fittings and ample hot water.  You could even change the colour of the water column by means of LEDs in the shower head – never did work out the point of that, but it was fun.  The bed?  Oh, the bed!  Deep feather/down bed, fluffy pillows and a light but warm duvet – I slept so well, and even (for a moment) thought about taking Sofitel up on their offer to have a bed delivered home…. only €3500.

So altogether and excellent hotel, with good rooms, good food an excellent staff.  Not a place to come if you want fun and games, but perfect for relaxation and a thorough pampering."
"We are currently staying at this hotel which is very nice indeed but the majority of the guests and the staff only speak French - so glad my French is getting me by.  Had a very very unpleasant experience by the pool yesterday!  Virtually every single sunbed is reserved by a book or a magazine for the whole day.   We went to the pool about midday and searched for a sunbed - eventually found one without a book or magazine and sat ourselves down - we would never have move any ones book or magazine.  We sat down for abut 10 mins and were turfed off the sunbed by one of the waiters who said it was reserved for a family of 10 and how dare we sit there as they were here for the week - incidentally we are here for 10 days!"
"My partner and I decided to take a trip out to Morocco for our anniversary this year. Based on the reviews for this hotel in particular and there only being a small handful of tourist places to visit... we decided to spend a little extra for thalassa to make the most of our hotel experience. 

No mistake... This has by far got to be the most wonderful place to stay in Agadir. We took a cheeky peek around some of the other hotels around the area on one of our walks but nothing even compared to the luxuriousness. The modernistic decor with a traditional approach from concierge desk will literally treat you like royalty from the moment you walk in. 

The best thing about this place is that it's right next door to royal bay resort which you have full access to.. This includes the amazing pool area, all the restaurants and facilities...

A very special and memorable thanks to Oussama El Bekri from customer relations, who was my partners point of contact prior to arriving. Osama was able to arrange a gorgeous private dinner next door at the royal bay resort with a customised meal chosen by my partner for our anniversary.  With our very own fantastic and genuinely nice waiter Mr Abdullah from room service who tended to all our requests for the night in a surrounding I can only describe as a scene from a movie.. 

"
"Agree with most comments regarding quality of the hotel, but I was overcharged £1,200.00 on the basis that my original payment did not go through, in fact it did months prior. Still fighting over the remaining £226.76 that I have yet to receive."
"Thank you to the staff who were excellent and very attentive to all ones needs. Food excellent, plentiful and well priced. The hotel's location on the beach with comfortable sun beds and attentive staff made this hotel for us. We booked it specifically because it had this feature and were not disappointed. 
However we thought the designer of this hotel wanted to create the wow factor rather than thinking about the ""user"".  The small open plan bedroom and bathroom was rather like being in a railway carriage! Complicated light system, Boas sound system on shelf behind bed head came on at slightest touch. Digital programmer in shower we never figured out. Very small light sensor open wardrobe with about 3 hangers each!  The design of 3 enormous life size metal chess sets set around, would have been great to have one playable set, such a waste of space! Live music was unnecessarily loud and piped music tedious especially at breakfast. Local guitarist preferable. The design of the water features were lovely and the reception area very dramatic on entering. All comments meant to be constructive and maybe just an age thing, we are in the over 65 years group!"
"My wife and I stayed here for a week in Feb with our two year old daughter and we had a great time. My only comments are the rooms are quite small even if you don't have a child. The lay out of the room is all wrong, Everything is in the middle of the room bed, bathroom etc. Also I would say get a south facing room in the winter months. The buffet was very good and not too expensive. The staff were all very friendly and helpful and looked after our daughter very well. This is easiliy the best hotel in Agadir and the staff are amazing.

"My husband and I joined up with my son for a short break at this lovely hotel.
I had read very positive reviews prior to our visit and was not disappointed, the whole stay was excellent, from the rooms to the restaurants and the pool area, all credit to management and staff who run this gem like clockwork.  The layout of the hotel is so well organised that we felt at times we were the only ones there. Afternoons especially when we sat overlooking the beach on the comfiest sofas with a bottle of well chilled  Moroccan Rose….. many thanks to all."
"The hotel is gorgeous and is the second to last on the beach at Agadir. This means that the marina with it's restaurants and cafes is a 4 mile walk across the beach when the tide is out, maybe 5 miles or more when the tide is in. There are some restaurants on the way there but not quite as nice as the marina setting.

The hotel is beautiful, you can tell that it is new and it is really well kept, although the maid did leave our door open one afternoon and one of our keys went missing from the room which the front desk didn't seem too concerned about.

The food and drink is pricey, roughly £4 for a diet coke, £5 for a small beer. The dinner buffet was approximately £40 each, the food was good quality. For snacks etc there was a small supermarket woughly half a mile away where you could pick up 2 bottles of water less than £1.

The rooms were nice and the TV had a good range of tv shows, the bed was comfy and the shower was lovely.

All in all it was good but far removed from the town. There were a lot of good cafes on the marina which were very reasonable and full of locals."
"Staid for 3 nights. 

As in any Sofitel you will love the bed. Room service was great, very friendly & professional service from everyone. 

Comments: 
- I booked a sea view on booking.com, however what I was offered is a side sea view! I had to pay extra 300 Moroccan Dirhams per night to get a direct sea view, but it was worth it.
- wifi coverage is good, but the internet speed is really poor."
"Ready for a long review   we stayed Thalassa Sea & Spa new year 2014 
 and christmas 2013 next door at the sofitel royal bay 

so we can do a like for like i prefered the thalassa sea spa as a hotel    a little more compact 100 less rooms i think. i also like the room layout  the bedroom away from the main coridoor  so you do not get the noise from other guest like you can get in the royal  bay .
as always the  food is a little expensive ( but worth it ) some one has to pay for all the staff ( if you do not like the cost of the food etc there are lots of alternative not far away ) also as a sofitel guest  you are allowed to use / eat at both hotels and charge to room .
what we did not like   breakfast  room  ( was very cold ( you need to wear a jumper )  the hotel could afford to heat the room ( this was the whole stay 31 dec till 3rd jan 2015 ) 
also the only day we  sat / swam by the pool  ( the hotel allows sunbeds to be reserved at 7/8 am they say not but you look after this time and they are all full by the pool .  also the couple of hours we were by the pool we were not at any time asked if we wanted a drink etc ( only saw staff standing under sun shade  ( this is where the royal bay staff excelled i.e very attentive at pool side )( the staff were very help full in getting a sunbed near the pool).
so to sum up  i would return as  coments were only a slight hiccup    if i had children the i would probably stay at the royal bay just because the whole pool area is bigger and the hotel seams internal public areas bigger"
"Beautiful decor.  Excellent service.  Had such an amazing time here. Stayed in a suite didn't want to leave.  Will definitely definitely come here again soon.  Reminded me a bit of the chedi hotel in Oman "
"What a wonderful Resort! Built about two years ago it became a Moroccan Design Hotel, state of the art, great restaurants, gorgeous pool area, private beach, and an amazing Thalassa and SPA. Special pools for Aqua Fitness with rowing machine, stepper etc.  under water.  The staff is very trained and extremely polite and friendly. a separate gym  - all brandnew Technogym Equipment - with private Coach is available as well. in 2014 the Thalassa got the ""World Luxury Spa Award, Winner of the Continent Africa"" and this is well deserved! Special thanks to the Directrice Ms. Najah Tamaoui and Leila and Imen for their daily Support!!! We liked the place so much, will already go back in March.

Agadir features a 7KM beautiful promenade along the sea, patrolled daily by police and the whole city is very safe."
"Luxury hotel at the far end of the pier, lovely rooms, we had a top level garden room. Generally very quiet and well insulated rooms, lovely layout and amazing bed. 

Breakfast is really good and tasty. Enough options for everyone. Bread and pastry is amazing as you would expect from a French hotel. Pool area well laid out but get there early to book a spot. It's just like high season at a European beach. 

Snacks and food are very expensive even for European prices but you are at a top hotel in Agadir so I guess that's they way it is. Pool food was average, we ordered grilled chicken pita, average. I must say the bread is amazing as you would expect, so even that alone is great.

All staff were very friendly and tried to accommodate us all round. Language can be a problem if you can't speak French which is sort of not really acceptable but I can so that made it all right but my wife struggled at times which would have been a problem otherwise.

We had a major delayed flight so were a day late on arrival even with sending emails to keep them in contact they didn't get any contact from us (??) so released our rooms even with full payment up front. I have complained bitterly to Sofitel and awaiting response. Probably same for all hotels really.

Also walk to the marina on the other side is about 60 mins total. It's not 20-30 mins walk as the staff say... Still lovely but don't be fooled if you have trouble walking long distances."
"My wife, son (8) and I visited this hotel the week before Christmas.
The hotel is modern and very new. We had a garden, sea view room.
The whole place was immaculately clean, from the rooms to the pool area.
This hotel oozes luxury in every area. There are three restaurants in the hotel and more in its sister hotel next door. You are allowed to use all facilities from both hotels.
As my son spends most of his time in the water, the pools were important to us and we were not disappointed... We could also walk straight from our pool on to the beach.

I must say that what really makes this place is the staff, from reception through to the pool staff, they all made us feel special, especially Youness at the pool side and Rashid in the bar who made our son a different fruit animal to go with his mocktail every day. It's just the little things like everyone remembering your name and what you like that made the difference.

The food was amazing, we mainly ate in the Market Place restaurant, which had a different theme each night, in a buffet style, which meant there was always something that our son would like as well as providing a great selection for my wife and I. The food seafood restaurant was also great.

We also explored some restaurants in Agadir.. One that stands out was called 'Pure Passion' in the marina. If you ask at the hotel reception most restaurants will send a car to pick you up... If not it only 20drm (about £1.25) for a taxi that you can pick up outside the hotel.

If you are looking at this place, look no further as it will exceed your expectations and you will have a great time. Thank you so much to everyone at the hotel for a great holiday. Sofitel, you should pat yourselves on the back, for a job well done at the Thalassa."
"I just want to share with you all the amazing holiday that we had last summer at Sofitel Agadir  Thalassa, we where there for 3 weeks and we never had a dull moment.
We met really nice people they became very close friends of us and we still have contact:)))

Ilham Mestour"
"First class brand new hotel (completed barely two years ago) with top views and,  worth highlighting as not always the case,  free Wi-Fi everywhere in the hotel,  including the pool area.  Total dedication from the staff who give you all they have with a smile and professionalism. Special thoughts for Abbes and Habib,  amazing chefs from the patisserie section who helped produce an outstanding Christmas patisserie garden party and an amazing Christmas buffet (served by a very helpful Idermi).  Said, Youssef and Younes were amazingly helpful with children by the pool. Overall a wonderful Christmas thanks to an overwhelming generosity and dedication to client service. "
"Hi ALL

If you're thinking of booking this hotel, stop thinking and do it! The thalassa Sea and Spa is the newer Sofitel and has a very contemporary décor compared to the traditional one of the Royal bay resort (next door)

I stayed in December 4 nights, exquisite luxury!!! A fine top notch hotel and staff pay attention for detail. It was quiet but more that worked in my favour. The weather in December isn't hot but luke warm, but that's much better than the UK - hands down.

The resort is at the end of the Agadir beach, a 20 minute walk to the main area, pleasant on the sea/sand path!. OR a £2 -£3 taxi ride. Airport 30 mins away with 220 dirhams.
There is a local store near the golden beach apartments, reasonably priced and a larger supermarket (marjane) a 10 minute taxi ride away. The main souk is 10 mins away by taxi. on promenade as you walk to the main centre area 15 mins into the walk are 3 very good resturants, (el toro and 2 others- very good again)

The hotel itself is a gem!! great food, great designing, excellent service. The wifi connection was good, but it was quiet and I can imagine in the summer it can be slower!! Many great resturants and a great bar in hotel. Peace and relaxation. A well designed pool/garden area for all.

The review about rooms being small _ I was in 205- it wasn't small. There was a very sizeable and trendy balcony facing the ocean, very scenic and relaxing! And yes it was clean, ignore those that say it wasn't as clean. The rooms are on a background of black floor tiles and again in bathroom, for those that are in the know, black shows everything!! In short the cleanliness not an issue.

Reception staff were ever so helpful and very courteous and respectful.

Will Definitely be back!!"
"Me and my wife stayed there for a week in the begin of November and have only good things to say about the resort and people working there.
Asking to be picked up from the airport on arrival proved to be a good idea as taxis are a bit battered for comfort and not a good recommended way to start your holiday. We were chauffeured on a nice vehicle, with air conditioning and a nice chauffeur.
On arrival we were treated to some nice tea and war towels while the chauffeur was taking care of check-in. We were shown the hotel by a reception team member and  taken to our room with sea view. We stayed at room 205. The whole process took less than 20 minutes and we were ready to enjoy the place. Room was spotless and the view was amazing.
Unfortunately it rained on that first day, and to be honest it did suit us well as we were shattered from travelling, and a few days stay in London prior to flying to Morocco.

But that was a one off and for the rest of the week the weather was excellent.

We were treated everywhere we went and staff, or ""Ambassadors"" as they like to be called, were at hand to fulfill all our needs. And i mean, everything we needed just had to ask.
My wife was portly for a couple of days and they even went to the pharmacy to get all she needed. They were always checking on us to make sure all was ok and if a doctor was needed. Luckily that was not the case.

For the next few days we got to really enjoy the hotel facilities as much as we could. The food at all restaurants, LE MARKET, L'ATLANTIQUE, LE PALAIS DU JARDIN, was superb and staff were a match for the quality. Nice to stay in and enjoy a great environment and great food after a day out. The master chef at the Market leads an excellent and pleasant team there. Have to single him out as he was one of the ones who cared the most when my wife was poorly and he took care of her diet. I apologize for not remembering his name but management will know lol 

Mohamed, a very pleasant young lad with braces really provided everything we needed while at the pool area. Also the 2 life guards there were amazing and going out of their way to provide for us.

Somehow my wife convinced me to go to the spa for a couple of massages and i really enjoyed the experience. Of course she also had a great time there. Fathima took very good care of us there. 
Finally, The Amane Bar was a perfect ending for our already fulfilled days. I have to single out this area because this was the icing on the cake of our days. Anaas the manager, Fathima the assistant manageress, Rashid, and all the great barman's in there to whom i apologize for not remembering the names ( I had a list with all the names but i lost it somehow) Carol & Kevin provided the animation and are 2 excellent musicians, who engage extremely well with all the guests. My wife's birthday was on our departing day, and Anaas and Fathima arraged a surprise party for her for which she will be tankful for the rest of her life. The gesture meant a lot.
Anaas took care of a load of things for us, recommending the night meals, the right trustable taxi driver for a proper visit to Agadir, the night club SO Lounge at Sofitel Royal Resort for Saturday, provided for the odd homemade tea for the days after the ""nights out"" lol etc. TIRELESS. Great asset at the hotel and very well followed by his staff.

I even managed to watch my team Benfica, Live on the big screen on match day lol. Thanks to the technician (sorry for not having the name) who found the Portuguese channel for me. We ask, we get at this place. A big thanks for that!!!

There would be loads of more things to write about but i would be here forever praising all the goods of this really great hotel.

It might be a bit more expensive using some of the services at the hotel than going out and shop around, but friendship, care, quality and the ""at home"" feeling you get here is PRICELESS.

For visiting town on taxi, and forgive me if not allowed, i recommend you see someone like the bar Manager Anaas, who know fair drivers with good taxis and proper fares. The ""Petit Taxi"" can be a tricky and unpleasant adventure, as well as expensive, if you get a bad taxi and a dodgy driver.

On the day we left, the bill was again dead quick to settle (recomend you ask for it the night before so you can have a proper look, and it will make it faster in the morning to checkout) and we were on our way to the airport using the hotel's chauffeur. Bit more expensive, but after you try a normal taxi we will give me credits for this piece of advice.

About my stay, out of 10 i would got for 10. Many thanks to all who made this holiday so special. The named above, and the ones i could not retrieve the names. I really apologize for it. That was the reason it took me a month to write this review, to see if i could find all the names i needed.

Looking forward to go back

"Returned yesterday from a fabulous week at this hotel. It was fascinating to see immaculately dressed, well managed staff behaving as if they loved their work so much they would do it for nothing if there was no alternative! They are, indeed, ambassadors. Management throughout is discreet but it is reflected by the conduct of the 'ambassadors' regardless of where they work within the organisation. A huge 'well done' to all of them. The hotel is blessed by the presence of an Executive Chef, Martial Clement, whose experience far exceeds what you would expect and I am talking about working at senior level alongside Michelin Star chefs in London and Paris. His staff are superb and the food is fabulous, varied and tasty. The beds are the best I have ever found in a hotel. It is very unlike me to stay at a hotel and not have something to moan about, but I feel I should offer some constructive criticism and my next comments are no more than that. The lighting in the rooms needs to be improved and some more space should be found to hang items like dressing gowns, towels etc. There is only one chair for two people to watch TV so one person needs to lie on a bed. This is a hotel we would return to without hesitation given the chance."
"The hotel staff was great we spent the last night in the suite 219 for my birthday.
The restaurant l'Atlantic is fabulous, the food, the wine but most of all i'd like to thank the staff at the restaurant. They were awesome, the Pastry Chef prepared a special chocolate cake for me.
I highly recommend the hotel and its restaurant.

"I really enjoyed my stay at sofitel, is a really five stars hotel!beautiful rooms and delicious food at the restaurant .My husband and I enjoyed the music's nights and we really loved each morning at the pool. The staff was really kind with us, especially a boy called Omar, he have always reserved us me a good place in the poolside and he always was friendly and helpful.
thanks you, I will recommend  Sofitel Hotel to my friends and relatives, see you next time!"
"Very lovely hotel, once you have the hang of agreeing a taxi price life here is perfect. My partner was poorly the first week and I could not fault the care and attention paid by the staff. Food well, perhaps they need to sort a more relaxed and affordable option? As a clean freak I was slightly overwhelmed by the constant cleaning of the public areas, but I felt sorry for the room staff who didnt seem to have enough time  to service our room to the same high standard. Rooms need a little bit of TLC chipped sinks not really acceptable... but all this was forgotten when you lay on the private beach and enjoy lunch by the pool. We have to say a very special thank you to Annis and Jasmine who made our stay very special. If you will have us we will come back for our honeymoon next year .... 007 :-)"
"Not comparable to a five star in London or Paris but definitely one of the best hotels in Morocco.
Yes, the hotel is somewhat away from the medina. local sights and restaurants etc but this means they have beautiful expansive grounds and facilities. 
We were upgraded to a beautiful suite with rose pedals arranged on the bed and floor. The breakfast buffet had many options and the presentation was excellent.
We found the staff to be helpful and friendly.
The only negative related to the taxi service from the hotel. The hotel concierge would tell us the fare to a certain place would be 20 HD and the taxi driver wanted 150 DH. The staff does not require the taxis that work the hotel to turn on the meters and the taxi drivers are undoubtedly ""in bed"" with the staff who gets the taxis. Every fare became an exercise in negotiation or getting ripped off.
If you plan on visiting local sights or having your meals outside the hotel this may not be the ideal  place to stay unless management gets a handle around the taxi issue but if you plan to stay at the facility then it is an excellent choice."
"World-class, fabulous hotel for a stylish, relaxing break from it all. I arrived here having been trekking in the mountains for a week, so somewhat dishevelled. It is testament to them that they dealt with my bags (and me!) with such professionalism and care. Within minutes of arriving I felt the kindness exude from absolutely every member of staff. Except they don't call them staff they call them 'Ambassadors' - a title I first thought a bit ott but by the time I left after three days I can say that it is well and truly apt. Gorgeous spa, food, drinks, pool and sunbathing area and, of course rooms but, above all, the people. I just can't fault my experience here. This is a stylish place but not in the least bit pretentious. I will so be going back and I might take my husband next time!"
"My husband & my daughter stayed at Sofitel Thalassa for a week late October. We arrived in the early hours of the morning and was offered Moroccan Tea & macaroons. We were greeted by Salim who took care of our suitcases, the receptionist checked us in and offered us a complimentary room upgrade (ocean view).

The room was a nice size, was clean and we had a good size balcony with a lovely side ocean view.

The buffet breakfast was good, the choices of fruit and juices was plentiful. It was a slight shame there were no hash browns on offer, but hey oh you can't have everything! The staff were always at hand to assist, there was plenty of seating outside & in.

The poolside staff were always very helpful with finding us beds, getting us towels and also bringing drinks & food. The food in the hotel was great, however; we were kept waiting a while waiting for our food on occasions. 

The hotel had it's own private beach, which was ideal. We enjoyed the hotel being at the bottom end as it allowed us to walk up to the marina. 

The hotel was very beautiful, everything was clean. The grounds were beautiful and it oozed luxury. I had a foot massage as well as a back massage, my husband and daughter enjoyed their massages also. The staff were very professional and the treatments were very relaxing, the prices were a little expensive (in my opinion) but thoroughly enjoyed my time.

One thing I would like to suggest is that, if the newsletters / leaflets left foe guests could come in other languages. We had to have one of our leaflets read by the receptionist as it was in French. Apart from that that's it.  We loved our stay and would definitely love to come back & stay with you should we return!"
"Stayed in the Thalassa Sea and Spa for a week last month; would certainly recommend it. Modern hotel, great size room with good facilities; in particular the bed was extremely comfortable. Only gripe was that the lighting was very poor - but that's a common fault in many hotels I've visited. Ate breakfast there every day; lots of choice and everything was fresh and well cooked. Also ate at both the buffet restaurant and seafood restaurant, and the food was good in both. The pool was lovely - a very good size so not overcrowded, and just the right temperature. The pool staff were very helpful, always finding us beds and towels, and were very good at taking orders for drinks - although at times the service could be slow. The hotel has its own private beach which was very clean, and the general décor of the entire hotel was tasteful. Definitely to be recommended."
"We arrived in the Thalassa Sea and Spa Hotel late evening checking was very smooth and welcome us with Morrocan tea and macaroons that were nice
The room was spacious and had a great view of the sea and gardens. Good outdoor terrace.
 From hotel the beach is almost 2 minutes we walk every day after breakfast which was nice
The room was cleaned thoroughly every day our room had only shower no bath, Bottled water was provided complimentary every day, we used the gym few time it was ok

We went for BB food was ok not much choice of fresh fruit. We liked the fresh pancake station and fresh orange juice, omelette station was ok not much choice 
Mainly spoken French and Arabic 
Taxi to town cost between 20/30 dirham always fix’s price with  driver  before get into taxi
There is marajn shopping supermarket 10 minute by taxi you can buy almost anything  fix’s price only ,nearby there is McDonald 
Hotel has free WIFI which is very good
Checked out was very smooth
Our airport transfer was late to picked us up
But reception guy made calls to the tour operator several time while we waiting he offer us some tea that was nice and finely door man was very helpful making sure open the door from taxi 
Would I stay at this hotel again yes why not, hope there food choice get better
Thank you Sofitel"
"i was stayin at the sofitel royal and i discovered the restaurent by night , the best buffet i had in many years

th quality of the food was amazing and i can tell you that it was better than some any fancy restaurent Agadir

the chefs are high quality at the restaurent, just get to their buffet and discover evry night a different thema i can see huge difference compared to the buffet at the royal even if it was good there but the quality here is amazing

even if you are in another hotel you have to viste this restaurent and try their different menus

chapeau to the chefs

if i had a little remark i think the service, the waiters are not very smily guys very serious 

thank yo again and i know where to go when am in Agadir"
"A perfect hotel in every respect - service, food, rooms, pool, all staff, and a ""wow"" at the spa.  Would not stay anywhere else in Agadir. The pool is very large with long section around 50m for length swimming.  The staff around the pool are so attentive - helping you choose your beds, putting up the umbrellas, and even cleaning your glasses! Plenty of space for everyone - no need to worry about reserving beds.  
The beach is amazing which is immediately in front of the hotel.  The surf is at its best in October.
There is the promenade running all the way in to Agadir harbour but it is a long walk - At least 40 mins.  But half way you come to restaurants. There is little in the way of shops here.  One mini market is about 10 mins walk from the hotel - front  entrance and turn left along the main road and adjoining the Golden Beach hotel.
We ate all the time at the hotel on a half board basis.  The variety and quality of the food was amazing.
Nothing is too much trouble.  We will go back in 2016."
"From the moment we arrived in the Thalassa Sea and Spa Hotel we were made to feel special and welcome.  The staff are really excellent and are there to facilitate a relaxing time.

The room was spacious and had a great view of the sea and gardens.  Good outdoor terrace.

The room was cleaned throughly every day and turned down every evening.  Bottled water was provided complimentary which was much appreciated.  The room was well maintained and very clean.  Towels and accessories were fresh and of high quality.

We went half board and were very impressed by the personal service and standard of the food.  It was of a very high standard and in particular the baked items on offer were really some of the best I have ever sampled.  Half board seems to offer the best value as the menu prices are a little expensive.

Breakfast was very good with plenty of fresh fruit, fresh orange juice and the coffee was also particularly good.  

Dinner was of a very high standard with a variety every evening.  There was a good variety of salads and mains on offer.  The desserts were really something very special - hard to resist !!
This is really good if you have small children which we did and it means that you can enjoy a good dinner every night.  The staff were very good with children and had a genuine interest in engaging with the children.  

The pool area and facilities were very well maintained and there was the choice of a lounger or a beach cabana.  the pool was very well maintained and had life guards and attendants on duty at all times keeping and eye on the children.  

One of the lifeguards even offered our 3 year old some swimming lessons, which was great.

The beach area was very nice and was only 10-20 metres from the Ocean.  

The hotel is a little way out from the centre of Agadir but if you are there to get away from it all then thats not a problem.. City centre was a 30 Dhm( 3 euro)  taxi ride which takes around 10 min so easy to get around.

The Hotel has free wi-fi which is great and worked very well for the 7 days we were there.

The attentiveness of the staff was particularly impressive.  I couldn't count the number of time during the week when they asked us if there was anything else they could do for us.  

On one of the days we took a trip to two of the medinas and also to some other sights.  The taxi driver took us around for a morning for 200Dhm which was great.  

A big thumbs up…we would definitely go back ."
"Hotel is very nice, much better than expected. Nice grounds, great positioning, nice architecture; a modern twist to a local style. Staff were excellent - they really, really were focused on customer service and it showed from the most junior members of the team to the senior management. Everyone was polite and professional and tried to make you feel like an honored guest! Not everything was perfect, don't get me wrong; however, remember, the first language is Arabic, the second is French and then English... so do make sure you have clear conversations with staff when ordering things or trying to arrange or agree anything... or, learn French or Arabic!!

The hotel team got it 99.9% right! The only area I would suggest more focus is that we had two separate bookings that joined to cover the week... we were told we could remain in the same room, but then actually had to change rooms mid week which made me feel like a second class guest compared to the family who 'wanted' our room! This wasn't handled well by the hotel front desk and got me more annoyed at the change of plan and the way it was positioned as a done deal without anything but an apology!"
"Youssra the lady on reception, I mentioned I liked her bracelet and she went to a souk to buy me one! This made me feel like a princess! Every time I saw her after that she gave me a hug and a kiss. I left her some white roses when I left. She also upgraded our room to a room with a nicer view as requested by my husband with no fuss made at all. For making me feel so special she deserves a special treat. The pool and beach staff (all of them!) were also incredible with the towel service laying down and the sunglasses cleaning and the canapés of fruit by the pool! I really wanted a henna tattoo and they called some one from the marina and transported her to and form the hotel beach to do my henna. The room service were amazing, they set us up a private dining experience on the last night and lay out petals, candles and a bunch of flowers with special mood lighting on the terrace. Again we felt like kings and queens! Such an amazing hotel not only structurally but mostly by the staff employed there! On our departure we were given a bag with water and macaroons and on arrival Morrocan tea and macaroons I think this was the porters. Thank you and hope to see you soon - would like to move in please! 

A little bit of Morrocan Paradise! Traditional dress of staff, modern galleries, bedrooms and bars/restaurants and traditional food and drinks available. a wonderful stay! Don't normally say we would return to a hotel but this is one we would return too!"
"My wife and myself stayed in Sofitel Thaslassa Sea and Spa Hotel from October 4th. to October 11th. We also stayed there in March. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves on both occasions. Sofitel is truly a wonderful hotel.  We found the staff to be courteous, kind, friendly, obliging and helpful. Everybody had a positive attitude. Rarely have we come across such attention to detail and a  willingness  to attend to our  requests.
The hotel is brilliantly maintained and is spotlessly clean. The pool area, gardens and beach area are a joy to behold. Breakfast is excellent. Though food and drink are expensive in the hotel.
We returned home fully refreshed and relaxed."
"I stayed here with my wife in November 2012, the weather was OK around 20 sometimes it went a bit higher, but it was hot enough to escape the freezing temperatures of the UK.

To keep this short and sweet, I would say this is a fantastic hotel for couples especially, apart from being a beautiful hotel inside and out, the service was as expected brilliant, small gripe was the slightly small room, we still enjoyed our stay as we were located right outside the amazing pool.

Overall I would recommend this hotel very highly, if you have kids then go to the Sofitel Resort next door, which will be a better choice for a family, but for couples who like fine dining and some peace and quiet, this is the perfect hotel, and finally do spend some time on the private beach on the beach beds, it really is incredible."
"When we booked our last minute trip to Agadir we didn't have high expectations, boy were we wrong! This hotel wouldn't look out of place along side the luxurious hotels in Dubai, in fact it would give them a run for their money. This is just what we needed for a week of relaxation.
Upon arrival we were greeted by management, room upgrade, smooth and quick check in and escorted to our lovely room to settle in. Our room was comfortable, modern, a little dark but had a lovely large terrace overlooking the pool area and down to the beach. We also got the late afternoon sun on our balcony so a little extra sunbathing time after lounging around the pool all day. One evening we got left roses in our room, another night fresh macaroons and cake and also a huge fruit basket. There was no decaf coffee but this was no problem, 10 minutes later a nespresso machine with decaf coffee was bought down to us from one of the suites. The staff really can not do enough for you, there's always management walking around the hotel day and night checking your stay is perfect and if there's anything they can do to make it better believe me they will do it, no questions asked.
The real stars of the show for me were the pool guys. So attentive and friendly. If I got up to move my lounger to follow the sun you can guarantee somebody would appear to do it for me. You're on holiday madam you don't need to do anything. In the afternoon fresh fruit is brought around to you to snack on. They regularly came round to check if we needed anything without being too much or in your face. I was joking with one of the guys about needing a lower factor sun oil or argan oil for a better tan, 5 mins later a pot of argan oil was at the side of me.
Each day we received a daily programme of events in both the sofitel hotels and a nice little touch was the managers cocktail evening where guests are invited for drinks and nibbles to meet the management team.
We ate in both restaurants and above average food. The dessert area to the buffet is just divine. They have one hell of a pastry chef. We did try two of the restaurants in the sister hotel next door, la Nasse which is Asian cuisine and so good which is part of the nightclub, food good in both, service no where near on par with the thalassa hotel. It's worth going next door for a change of scenery but you will be glad you chose this hotel instead of its sister for many reasons.
We ventured out the hotel a couple of nights, it isn't far by taxi to the marina where there are beautiful restaurants and bars and as 2 women travellers we felt very safe, nobody bothered us. There are a few comments on here that the hotel is too far out but like I say not far in a taxi which costs about £2 or the walk along the promenade is a beautiful walk and a perfect way to see the beautiful sun set. One night when we were out we happened to bump into a couple of staff and ended up staying for drinks with them, again felt very safe like we were out with old friends.
The spa is also worth a mention, we had a few treatments which were very good and it really is a lovely relaxing spa experience. This hotel is ideal for a ladies spa holiday! 
I've noticed a lot of people on here have commented and said how pricey it is but to be honest I think it's no different to any other 5 star hotel and after all you get what you pay for.
All in all it's been perfect, from the truly welcoming staff to the location itself. This is by far the best hotel in Agadir! We usually spend Christmas in Dubai but as this was so good and under 4 hours from the UK we are seriously debating spending Christmas in the Sofitel Thalassa sea and spa this year!
Lastly we would like to thank Kamil (director of operations) for making us very welcome from our first step in the hotel to saying goodbye and to ALL the wonderful staff for making this such a pleasurable holiday."
"My partner and I stayed at this hotel for 5 nights end of September. All in all we were very happy with everything.

The hotel is beautiful, new, stylish, luxurious and very quiet. This is probably a good thing but we were a little irritated when staff told us, the hotel was fully booked and there were still only 20 people at the pool and 2 people at the bar in the evening. It's a great great place to relax though and if you prefer high life, you can always go to the sister hotel next door ;-)

Best thing about the hotel is definitely the pool area and staff. I have never experienced nicer, more friendly and attentive staff than here. As mentioned in previous reviews, prices for food and especially drinks are very high and we ended up eating out every day. I think that's a pitty, I would've liked to try their restaurants but it's just not worth it spending 5 times the price when you can go to the best rated restaurant in town (Pure Passion!) with free pick up and great food for much less. 

One thing my partner was very frustrated about was the wifi. We had much better connection even at McDonalds, the wifi was not 5* standard and needs improvement.

Oh and one more thing to add, only on our second last day I realised there's activities such as cooking classes and gym sessions, it would've been nice if someone had explained that to us earlier so we would've had a chance to participate.

Nevertheless, a great hotel and I'm very glad I chose this one over all the other hotels in Agadir. (I especially don't understand why the other Sofitel seems to have better reviews but that's probably because people pay less and expect less)"
"Reference will also be made to its sister hotel Royal Bay Sofitel certain of whose facilities are available to Thalassa guests.

Originally booked into Royal Bay Hotel, we were transferred to Thalassa as our room was unavailable (this was blamed on the travel agent) and we refused to accept a downgrade for the first night.

We were lucky because the Thalassa is undoubtedly a better property being both newer and with a far superior ambiance. Rooms, even luxury, are small but well perfectly formed. Entrance hall had toilet and a very small dressing room. Bathroom had single basin, rain shower and quality toiletries. Usual mini-bar and flat screen TV. In addition we had a small terrace with sofa and chair seating. The best part of any Sofitel offering is its bedding, and its good to get it in distant countries. There was also a Bose radio with iPod dock. But note, given its size, this is not a room to spend time in. The servicing of the room as adequate although on more than one occasion we had to make requests for the 'free' bottle of water that should have been provided. The promised daily afternoon patisserie was delivered  one day in four.

Breakfast was an excellent buffet which could not be faulted. The same remark could be made for the evening themed buffets which also always featured local fare in addition. Service was impeccable. We used the facilities at the Royal Bay sister hotel once and they could not compare to the Thalassa equivalent. Whilst we were there, there were never queues or shortages of the excellent food.

Dinner in the Moroccan restaurant was a disappointment. Whilst the food was adequate, it did not show flair or impress. The atmosphere was lacking with very few tables taken and only a token single musician played for short periods - certainly not comparable with many other offerings in other good Moroccan establishments.  And of course it was priced at a premium.

We took one lunch at the Restaurant L'Atlantique which again was excellent both in its out door ambiance facing the ocean and its superb fresh fish served with local produce. Definitely recommended. 

The pool and grounds, which included a small area of private beach, were superb. This is a place where every comfort is provided and tranquillity reigns.  

Check-in and out were both efficient and friendly.

For a short break I would highly recommend this Sofitel."
"Stayed  at Sofitel Thalasso Agadir in July 2013 ... the entrance and the lobby area was very tastefully decorated . All staff are attentive and courteous.

Our room are nicely decorated with free mini bar of soft drinks ,  water and free tea/coffee making machine.

We had breakfast the next morning , with great variety of western and arabic option. My favourite is the freshly squeezed juice section / freshly made smoothie .. 

the pool  area are very very spacious  with ample of space
, never feel too crowded, the beach bar is wonderful with
great food/ drinks and not expensive at all.

The beach is a public area , the hotel have wonderful
beach beds, comfortable chairs for all guests .

The Spa is wonderful , once again ,  very spacious , tranquil and wonderful staff.

We also sample their sister property right next door , the Sofitel Royal agadir , this property is more lively and have a nice lounge for live music and entertainment.

Me and my friend both enjoyed our stay and certainly will return to Sofitel in future."
"Absolutely brilliant hotel - fantastic service, lovely rooms and lounges, and excellent location. 

We came with strict dietary requirements and the manager/chef went out of their way to cater to our needs. The 2 restaurants in the hotel are a very high standard. 

Best hotel in Agadir - would love to visit again

"
"I visited this resort with my mother and we had a wonderful and safe time. We actually found the staff to be extremely friendly (despite what some reviewers say) and very talented and interesting! We don't speak French but it didn't seem to be a problem for the most part. Lots of food options and the prices are very reasonable considering what you're getting. The hotel also did currency exchange for us and helped us secure a car and driver for some inland exploration.

I'm 25 and I would love to go back to this hotel with a group of young people. It's very trendy and priced well for the luxury you're getting. There were hookahs you could rent when I was there and drink service pretty much anywhere in the hotel."
"In fact, this was a very good hotel. Some visitors feel angry with the service or the staff. They are angry because they dont understand or know the nature of morrocan people. The morrocan people are good but difficult to smile, so they are not bad but its their nature. Anyway, i like the hotel and the staff. The food was OK but you can find better outside."
"Stylish rooms, friendly and professional reception stuff.. I would like to express many thanks to guy from the pool Boudjn by name for his recommendations to visit nice places in Agadir and making our vacation carefree and unforgettable.. It's a big pleasure to recommend this hotel to all our friends and hope to visit this place again "
"We stayed here as a couple in June 2014 for a relaxing week half board in a side sea view room. The hotel itself is exactly as you will have seen in the pictures. Clean, trendy, relaxing and generally up to many of its namesakes and certainly of a 5 star standard. This of course means that you will pay for those 5 star moments. Take the drinks for example. You will pay 30 euros for a bottle of Moroccan wine that is 5 in the supermarket. Of course what you are paying for is a 5 star restaurant in a gorgeous location with the sunset in the background. Still expensive for wine I felt and it all adds up over the holiday. The a la carte is also not a sufficient upgrade from the main restaurant to warrant the 100 euro per person charge, Again lovely having a minibar in the room but make sure you check the price list. Still not unusual for a truly 5 star hotel. The facilities were fantastic including the spa. The Hotel being a French chain is very popular with French tourists but that certainly is not a bad thing. The one piece of constructive criticism I could offer is be sure to get a bed near to the beach restaurant if you want quick and frequent service for your drinks and poolside snacks. All in all though a fantastic stay and we would definitely return."
"Hi!

I do not tend to write much reviews on here however due to reading alot of negative comments regarding this hotel i had to.

I stayed here and checked out today and have to say, I have stayed at the Royal Atlas, Atlantic Palace, Palais De Roses, Kenzi & many other Hotels in Agadir i have to say myself and my wife enjoyed it here the most. - So much we will be returning here next week. (8/7/14) for a couple of nights.

My wife is muslim first of all and we stayed here during Ramadan - they fully catered to her needs by sending us a both complimentary in room breakfast service at 3am which was excellent. They gave us so much we could not even eat half of it!

The porters, reception staff, and front of house management are friendly, kind and will assist you with anything you require and at any time.

We never stayed here prior however on check-in we were offered a free room-upgrade and also we were the 'Guest of the day'.

I have not one bad fault nor comment to say regarding this hotel.

Flawless."
"This hotel is stunning and views were amazing. The check in was lovely with morrocon tea and biscuits on arrival. The hotel staff are very polite and friendly, thanks to Oussama and Karim, who works at the reception, who are exceptional staff as they were extremely helpful.

The rooms are stylish and were very clean with stunning pool view. 

Every morning we had breakfast, which was out of this world!! Ayoub the waiter was very friendly and brighten our mornings.

The fitness room is very nice, although it lack of free weights as the equipments were mainly hydrolics. I would like to say a big thank you to Kamel who is an exceptional fitness staff, and enjoyed training with him, he is an asset to Sofitel !!!! :)

Overall, the hotel is excellant if you looking for a vacation in a relax and calm environment.

Mr and Mrs Patel"
"A perfect getaway for the European who seeks a short flight towards the sunny and warm Atlantic coast. Just 3 hours from Paris, and a 30minute drive from the Agadir airport, this hotel welcomes you with open arms and beautiful smiles. The food is delicious (a different Tajine each evening at the Market restaurant), the rooms are spacious, and calm and the teams are extremely helpful. One can enjoy the day either on the beach with a wonderful Beach staff ( Hassan, Khalid that are at you service), or by the poolside. A special hats off to the 2 life guards : Youssef and Said who are extremely professional. Said taught my 6 year old boy  in just 3 days how to co-ordinate his movements and now swims !!. I also witnessed an amazing ""bay watch"" scene : Youssef was called out to rescue a local women  that was drowning in the dangerous currents ( beware of the under-toe !)."
"We went for a 3 nights short break just enough for Agadir, hotel is not too far from the airport so the drive down was very pleasant as we had private transfer booked with our package. When we got to the hotel we were checked in smoothly the lobby was very tranquil with all the water features, we had traditional tea and cakes however maybe some refresher hand towels would have been nice. 

Once we got to our room it was very nice we had a good sea view even being based on the first floor, so we was happy with that.

The most disappointing thing about this hotel was it's spa facilities there were no special offers even though it's a spa resort! You had to have a treatment to use any of the facilities or pay extra to get in and there were no incentive to get you to use it. Me and my partner had a couples massage but had to pay extra to be in the same room! The Massage was good but nothing to get excited about the room we was in was old and clinical more like a morgue than somewhere to relax! It's expensive so if you have longer than do compare with other spa's. 

Eating in was expensive for the choice of what was on offer.
As we were only bed and breakfast we dinned in all the restaurants found the
Menus too simple with limited dishes. Breakfast was nice but again not much to chose from. 

I recommend this hotel as it's location was great n rooms were very modern, cleverly done for the space it has. This is a quite hotel with less children so a place for relaxing and enjoying the sun after all the weather is amazing this time of year!"
"I as scared by reading some comments and my only opinion is : This hotel is stunning and people can be not thankfull!
I am used to amazing and best hotels and this one is part of! The swimming pool is amazing, the garden is sunning, the beach as well. The food is great and the service is priceless!
Rooms can be small, but after it depend which category you book!"
"Great holidays and stay. The hotel is fantastic and the service friendly. I recommend the tennis lessons with the local coach who is professional and dedicated. The beach is beautiful and the views from the rooms are stunning. Great place to relax.
      "
"We were upgraded to this hotel from it's sister hotel next door (we couldnt afford to stay here otherwise although there are some great short break deals available online). 

On arrival we were greeted with mint tea and a cool flannel to freshen up. Check in was a dream and we were taken to our suite (standard room but can only be described as a suite). There was a large balcony overlooking the beach and mountains, double sofa and outside table. Twin room - double sofa and table inside, plasma TV, fully stocked fridge, complimentary water (and the nicest Moroccan tea ever), very stylish decor all traditional Moroccan style. The beds were extremely comfy. The shower was a waterfall one and has a one way mirror through above the bed so you can stand in the shower and look out of the patio doors and balcony but cant be seen. The way the room was laid out was original (on entry to the room the toilet was in a little room on the immediate left, the walk in wardrobe immediate room on right). Ahead of you was an island where the shower and sink was - you could walk either left or right around it to get to the bed and patio. 

The staff were all incredible friendly and spoke good English. However if you make an attempt to speak French to them they were delighted. 

The bar areas are lovely and clean - the staff attentive without being overfamiliar. The cocktails are gorgeous and generous and all served with nibbles. International football can be shown on request. 

The breakfast was a experience in itself - all totally fresh foods and anything you could imagine or want. My favourite was Moroccan pancakes and freshy squeezed juice. You can eat breakfast inside our outside on the terrace overlooking the beach / pool. We ate dinner in the restaurant aswell and this was delicious. Tagines and other delicious foods. 

The pool area is immaculate - but not stuffy. We were waited on hand and foot and there is even a chap who comes and cleans your sunglasses for you. There is a very attentive service at the pool and you can order freshly cooked snacks to eat. There is lots of shade under the 4 poster beds. The spa treatments are really good too - can recommend the full body massage and seaweed wrap. There is a modern fitness centre too. 

Its about a 25 minute walk along the beach to the tourist centre of Agadir - and there are some lovely restaurants along the front. There was no hassle and it felt really safe (we were 2 women together). There are also nice runs along the beach (path) for anyone of an athletic ilk - we did this a few mornings early and its full of runners. 

All in all i couldnt really find fault with this hotel and having travelled an awful lot in many different countries would say that it is a country mile ahead of any others I have ever stayed in. I would definitely recommend spoiling yourselves here!"
"I spent one week in Sofitel Thalassa and have just returned home after a wonderful holiday.  The rooms are big and beautiful with luxurious beds. I had a lovely balcony with a sea view to die for. There was complimentary tea,coffee and water, also fresh fruit and moroccan cake. I had Breakfast in The Market restaurant which had something to suit all tastes.  The swimming pool area was very nicely set out with no shortage of loungers or sunbeds as was the private beach area.  The staff at the pool area did a wonderful job and were very friendly. I would also like to mention the Room Service staff especially Brahim who was so professional, friendly and helpful. His English was almost perfect so it was very easy to explain to him exactly what I required. He is a wonderful ambassador for this luxury hotel and contributed to making my week more stress free and enjoyable. I would also like to mention Noura at reception and Khadija, Executive Housekeeper. I found my time in Sofitel Thalassa a very relaxing experience. The decor is spectacular and there is an ambiance there that you do not find in most hotels.  I will be returning to this hotel and would recommend it highly to anyone looking for a Hotel that is luxurious, relaxing and gives a top rate service."
"We felt safe and looked after at this hotel,yes it was dark inside but the room we stayed in was light and once we had figured the lighting out it was fine. The reception staff were most helpful. the restaurant staff very good and chefs skilled . We ate in most days as the one evening we ventured out we felt a bit unsure of the standard of hygiene and parking arrangements. No scores on the doors rating here. There are parking guardians who are licensed according to the Rough Guide and you just give the 3 Dhm when you leave . But at first no one explains that and it is a bit un-nerving. The food in The Market restaurant was good, not outstanding but inventive plentiful and a lot of choice. Many dishes were freshly made. We enjoyed it all, breakfast was one of the best . The room with a large patio was fine. The bed was the best, [Sofitel beds are superb], big with large pillows and I slept for longer than ever . The housekeeping was a bit erratic as someone else has said, missing towels ,milk pods, gowns without belts and the room not made up one day until 4pm but it was spotlessly clean each time. Great shower and clever arrangement of room . I was disappointed with the beach and whilst we were there no one ventured onto the beds arranged there. It is roped off but the sea is not suitable for swimming in,far too rough with fierce undertow. However the pool was amazing, huge and and whilst we were there we were the only 2 in for most of the day. It is heated and though the weather was warm not hot I think most of the other guests wimped out. I loved it and stayed in over 40 mins before exhaustion took over. The pool attendants were very efficient and as the hotel only appeared one third full we were well looked after. There were plenty of beds /loungers but not too crowded , we went to look at the hotel next door but glad to be back It felt more family orientated but rather crowded around the pool. The only down side was it took us two days to locate all the restaurants. A map in the room folder would help. A good winter break and the staff looked after us well."
"We've spent another days in May at Sofitel Thalassa Sea and Spa in Agadir.

The weather was great, very sunny, hot, the private beach is amazing, and what a joy to walk in the morning in the waves, through this long and wonderful beach !

The hotel is very modern, with luxury bedrooms, try the ones with terrace on the sea.
The all hotel is very clean, the breakfast at the buffet is delightfull with lots of fresh fruits, morocan pastries, all sorts of fruits juices and everything to get satisfied.
The bar is huge, with elegant furniture, all the gardens are cleaned everyday, it's reallly beautiful.

The staff is nice, friendly and helpfull.
We've had our lunch at the Atlantic, and the staff guys were as friendly as before, the had nice little attentions for us and it was lovely.

It's a perfect getway from stress and work for a week or less, not too far by plane from Europe, with sunny beach and another culture as well."
"This hotel is a very nice hotel, it is a very modern and beatifull hotel with class and style, the service is top class and the staff is very friendly and will do everything to make your stay perfect, "
"I was delighted with this Hotel, It was charmingly decorated.
The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful
Excellent position,the rooms were big,clean and extremely comfortable
Great restaurants, nice swimming pool.
And the spa was a sumptuous experience.
I highly recommend and will definitely stay there again on my next visit to Agadir."
"My wife and I just returned from our stay at this hotel on our ""mini-moon"". Due to email complications with guest services prior to our arrival we were upgraded to a deluxe sea view room which was very much appreciated. Sara the guest services manager also arranged for us to have VIP treatment as a gesture for us as newly-weds - this meant we had fruit and some pastries in our room on arrival. However I noticed that the service was quite good throughout the hotel from the moment we arrived. We got there quite late in the evening and Bouba the evening desk manager was very kind and attentive. We were treated to macarons and mint tea whilst we waited a short time for them to arrange our in room treats. They made flower arrangements on our bed and swan towels at the foot of our bed.
Falling into the bed was like being cuddled into a warm cloud and the duvet was like having another warm cloud drift over you and settle. This wore off after the strong smell of ""dry cleaner"" killed it after 2 days.
We didn't venture into Agadir and if I'm honest I wasn't really that bothered. I usually like venturing into new territory and exploring the local area on holiday but it wasn't that important for us on this break. Our main focus was to get spa treatments and enjoy the weather. We took a little walk off the resort where we were hounded by merchants trying to flog stuff and stared at by locals. My wife felt very unsettled so we stayed on the resort.
The food was a good standard at the hotel. Not Michelin, but expected of a 4/5* hotel. The food/drink prices are competitive with 5* European hotels so expect to pay in this range. The sunset from our room was beautiful and we were told only 7 of their rooms have a full undisturbed view so we felt privileged to have one.
Around the pool, the pool bar staff will attend to you. There are a lot of areas outside around the pool and I felt like their service was limited to the pool area just outside the restaurant. It felt like this was more out of their laziness than policy. They should tend to all the guests around the pool and not just the ones closest to the restaurant.
I prebooked the spa treatments after contacting the hotel before arrival. Laila who I chatted to prior to our arrival was very friendly and a joy to chat with. She arranged for our last treatments to be done together in our own private room. I also have to commend Fatima the Hammam lady. She looks after all who enter the hammam and her orange and mint cocktail is a refreshing welcome in the relaxation area after a steam. On the day of the hammam experience I was feeling quite tender. I pride myself on having an iron stomach having toured India for 6 months and getting ill one day. I'm not sure what it was (maybe too much sun) but something I ate at breakfast just wasn't agreeing with me. If you like your omelettes, I suggest getting them well cooked and avoid anything left out if you decide to go for breakfast at 10am.
I was really looking sheepish when we went for our spa treatment so Laila fixed me a herbal tea which tied me over till the evening.
My wife loved the constant stream of macarons from the bar staff and the seafood pasta from the main restaurant next door.
I have to say that the hotel was a bit of the dark side indoors and really needs an injection of light in the corridors. It was the same in the room. It just needs more light options for the evening in the room and more light in the hotel during the day.
All in all it was a good spa break at a luxury hotel with excellent service."
"Probably best hotel in Agadir. I got to stay at one of their suites and found it quite pleasant. The decoration is done quite well (if you enjoy hip and modern hotels). Staff was friendly and helpful. Certainly worth a recommendation."
"While Agadir itself was a bit of a dump, the Sofitel Agadir Thalassa Sea & Spa was a piece of heaven.The hotel was the perfect place fo my friend and I (both away without husbands and kids) to relax, eat well and enjoy sunshine every day. The staff were always pleasant and very accommodating for my various food allergies. The spa was amazing and very advanced with an incredible, huge hot tub with fitness equipment in the water. There was a bevvy of heavenly treatments to choose from. The fitness centre was also loaded with modern equipment which we used every day. And water bottles and towels are on hand for you there as well. 

Sick of having to deal with taxi drivers who took us on joy rides and argued with us about where we wanted to go, we spent more time than we had anticipated within the hotel grounds. We ate dinner at the neighbouring Sofitel which was beautiful as well, if a bit tired (pool cushions were ripped and well faded and the Asian restaurant's food was horrible). The food at the Sofitel's restaurants, however, was delicious every time. And the home-made juices were delicious to drink by the pool.

While we would have enjoyed a room with an ocean view, our ground floor room (number 006) was quite quiet and had a private little garden. The room was spacious for two people and always exceptionally clean. We received a massive fruit basket and cookies on our arrival and the minibar was free, which was also an added bonus. 

Breakfast, which cost about $22 was costly but worth it. Everything was fresh and there was a ton to choose from. We never got sick of the buffet. And they even had soy milk and gluten free products. 

Thank you Sofitel for a wonderful, relaxing recharge from our busy lives."
"The atmosphere and the design of the Hotel are really unique, the staff is particularly caring and helpful with a smile and a perfect understanding of privacy. I was there for business meetings but I could enjoy the beauty of the room - modern design but warm - and the very good food during lunch breaks. The pool is great - well just saw it !! I imagine that in warmer season an for vacation it should really be a relaxing, enriching place for some days."
"My partner and I visited Morocco in early February hoping to find some winter sun somewhere a little different and Agadir did not disappoint. In February, the temperature hovers somewhere between 22 and 25 degrees. We stayed in the Sofitel Agadir Thalassa Sea and Spa for 4 nights followed by three nights in a more traditional riad.

Perhaps the first thing to note is the need to be very clear to the taxi driver which Sofitel hotel you are staying at. There is a second Sofitel right next door to the Sofitel Agadir Thalassa Sea and Spa, (Sofitel Royal Bay Resort), and we ended up in the wrong hotel upon arrival. Also, it's worth noting that Agadir airport is around a 30 minute drive from the hotel. A fair price for the trip seems to be around 200 MAD, (something like £17 stirling), although we'd heard that people were charged anywhere between 150 MAD and 500 MAD. Personally, I thought the white knuckle taxi ride between the airport and hotel was good value for money - the concept of 'road sense' didn't seem to apply while we were there. My partner, however, did go a little pale during the journey so it might be worth trying to avoid any evening rush hour trips, (between 5pm and 7pm), if you're of a nervous disposition! 

We thought the hotel itself was excellent, although it certainly isn't the place to go if you're looking for somewhere typically Moroccan. There are nods and  references to traditional culture in the design and decor of the rooms and communal areas but, overall, the feel is very contemporary. 

Our room, (140), was fantastic. A large shower, (with it's own choice of mood lighting!), has a one way mirror allowing views over the balcony without any prying eyes seeing in. The open plan design of the room leads you from the shower area to the bedroom space. The bed was extremely comfortable and we both slept soundly for the four nights we stayed. There is a free minibar, (stocked with soft drinks), in each room. Our balcony provided the perfect vista to see both the sunrise and sunset, with views over the beach. There is some ""waste ground"" outside the hotel but it's not an eyesore - just a little unkempt. 

We ate in each of the hotel's restaurants. The Palais du Jardin seems to be the premium restaurant and the food was great. I had a cinammon-lamb vermicelli and my partner had a beef hotpot, (Moroccan style rather than Lancashire's finest!). We found it quite a formal restaurant and felt the need to ""dress up"" to eat there although that may be more of a reflection on us than the location. Also, unusually, I believe it's staffed entirely by females. The main dining room provides good food and is also where residents have breakfast. The breakfast choice was excellent and set us up perfectly for the day's exploring. There is also a restaurant offering healthy choices, (L'Atlantique), which is predominantly a fish restaurant. The food was excellent here too, although maybe a little expensive.

The outside pool space is very relaxing - warm water, plenty of sunbeds and cabanas and very attentive, but not overbearing, staff. My partner did try out the hammam and enjoyed it very much but said that she preferred the more traditional experience she had in Marrakech.

The hotel is at the end of a 7km, (approx) strip which runs the length of Agadir's seafront. It's a lovely, flat walk and there's a developing marina area at the end of it with some good restaurants and tea/coffee shops providing much needed refreshments. Along the walk, there are plenty of restaurants, small shops and beachfront, (none of whom were pushy as long as you gave them a polite ""no thanks). 

Overall, this is a really relaxing place to stay. The staff cannot do too much for you, (although English isn't widely spoken, it wasn't hard to make ourselves understood), and the surroundings were clean and contemporary. An excellent place to stay for a comfortable break in the not-too-searing sunshine but maybe not somewhere for those looking for a ""true"" Moroccan experience."
"Was there last week on a business trip. Beautiful hotel, very nicely decorated, stylish and modern. Staff were excellent, service was very good. Though the weather was too chilly for me to consider sunbathing or swimming, plenty of people around the pool chilling in the sunshine and enjoying it! I would consider going again in spring with my family for a vacation."
"This hotel is excellent if you are looking for a vacation in an relaxed and calm atmosphere....
 There were only one small complication when we booking a massage...There was confusion and it ended up with an cancellation...so be sure to have an written booking ....otherwise : the staff is very friendly and service minded..."
"Maybe it was the bad weather,it was far too cold to sunbathe ,go in the pool or on the beach..we went 07/11 and it was freezing.the hotel itself is very modern and dark.....everything is black or silver, room was on the small side with a very complicated shower! We had B and B but I would have preferred half board as there were no restaurants within wAlking distance that were open so we ate in the hotel anyway.the hotel is the last one on the strip so very private all very clean and chic but not at al Moroccan.highlights of the holiday...the duo singing I the bar and the Moroccan themed evening entertainment in the hotel next door.bad points...getting kidnapped by a taxi driver..they will take you where they think you go not where you want to go, having to eat at mcdonalds and Pizza Hut as that's all that was open ."
"This hotel was rather idyllic and had all that the amenities a good hotel may require. So in my regular fashion:

Good:
- very nice rooms - we got an upgrade to a suite and had a bathtub that could fit three and a great patio to relax in the afternoon. each room had free mini bar, tea and espresso machine 
- very nice grounds - lots of chairs around three pools plus cabanas around it and on the beach itself.
- very helpful staff - as soon as you got to the pool they got you towels asked if you needed drinks, smiles and said hello :-)
- we liked the food at the buffet dinner and breakfast - try the Moroccan wine you should not be disappointed 
- very good gym that opens at 6ish am on the weekdays - they offer PT sessions and yoga classes as well
- was also happy with my Hammam experience and spa - well recommended (ask for Fatima if you do Hammam she was great) 

Bad (kind of :-))
- not staff's fault but Sofitel should provide English classes for their employees - they all were lovely and tried hard but many were not able to communicate as well with us as with French speaking guest 
- we did not love the fancy restaurant as much - seems like the kitchen is the same as for the buffet which has more variety - the decor is nice at Palace but nothing else was better relative to the buffet"
"We got upgraded to the hotel and had a fantastic time. It was originally arranged through Groupon so we had a fantastic deal anyway. The food and drinks were cheap and would love to go back. Would high recommended to any couple looking for a holiday.
      "
"This classy hotel offered us a fantastic holiday - along with our 2 young children. We'd love to return sometime. The location - right on the beach at the far (not busy) end is fabulous. The rooms were lovely and the pool (heated) gorgeous. 
      "
"Impressive hotel a little off the main promenade but has all facilities you could wish for. Prices somewhat high but good service and facilities. Breakfast excellent, with an fantastic spread, and general quality of food was good"
"We stayed at the exclusive villas for 2 weeks with our children. The private pool was a great bonus. The spa is to die for - we had daily treatments booked. The staff were caring towards our children and we very much enjoyed the vacation "
"Just spent a week here for some winter sunshine, the hotel is very nice and modern at the quiet end of the promenade, the pool area is vast with plenty of sun beds, nice beach area although we never used it because of the strong winds which was blowing the sand everywhere. 

We had a deluxe garden view room, which was lovely and modern! but at night the room is rather dark in the seating area, so you are unable to read! although there is reading lights on the bed. The shower was one of the best we've ever had and the light therapy is really cool.

We ate one night in L'Atlantique which was very nice, the service was very good and the meal was nice but as you would expect very expensive. We sat in the bar a few nights but it was always the same entertainment which we didn't think was very good.

The only downside we found at the hotel was the cooked breakfast, the bacon, sausage and tomato was always cold, and the chefs couldn't cook eggs properly, it would have been nice to have a bit more variety, like a few mushrooms, beans or hash browns. If you don't want the cooked breakfast there's plenty of fruit and pastries.

Would recommend this hotel, if your not too bothered about a cooked breakfast, it is definitely one of the best along the promenade, but it is a good 30 minutes walk to the centre and another 20 minutes to the marina, the taxi should be 40 dhs to the marina but the taxi drivers will always try to rip you off, the older drivers seem to be better."
"Before booking we had read a lot of reviews and were a bit intimidated by those talking about the faulty interior etc. To counter this, I have to point out that yes, there are some flaws in how the hotel was built and some parts look like they were built clumsily or in a make-shift way. However, this does not alter the fact that you can have an amazing stay in this wonderful, stylish hotel.

We got a side-seaview room, which was well-equipped with a comfortable bed, big shower, separate toilet and a walk-in closet. Breakfast was amazing with a lot of fresh fruit juices, eggs and pancakes fresh from the pan and many other delights. Dinner at The Market was also definitely worth the money and service was always good. We were a bit disappointed by the Moroccan restaurant right opposite - quite expensive and good, yet not extraordinary. We would rather recommend Le Nassa at the Royal Bay Resort next door, which has incredible sushi, big portions and real value for money!

Leisure-wise the resort features a very well-equipped gym and a wonderful pool with really nice service personnel and comfortable sunbeds. Since it is one of the last hotels on the beach, you can have wonderful walks or jogs in the mornings. In sum, we enjoyed it so much that we barely felt like leaving the hotel. We would definitely recommend it for a weekend hideaway full of relaxation and good food."
"This newly opened resort hotel is an absolute gem. The wife and I visited for a quick week of winter sun in November 2013, the hotel was fairly quiet and we were lucky enough to be upgraded to a Prestige Suite overlooking the pool. The room was fabulous, but to be honest so was the rest of the hotel.

The weather in November is starting to turn chilly, but we had a good week of 20C sunshine and just two windy days. A little breezy generally for the beach, but the poolside area is quite sheltered along one side and very usable throughout the year.

The decor of the hotel is very modern and clean throughout. A stark comparison to several other hotels we visited in the area over the course of the week for dinner (including the sister hotel the Sofitel Royal Bay next door), all of which were rather tired and rather unglamorous."
"Overall its a cut above the other hotels in the area and on the whole a very enjoyable stay. The rooms are stylish and are very comfortable although the attention the detail could be improved e.g shower mood lighting didnt work and some missing tiles around the sink.The pool area is fantastic and the service consitently excellent. Breakfast food is good, service indifferent ,one or two of the staff lacked the hospitality levels expected. Dinner service same as breakfast and upscale local restaurants offer a far better experience. Gym and spa facilities first class and you can also use the gym of the hotel next door which has more free weights."
"This is an excellent hotel.  Stylish, calm with exceptional service from attentive and friendly staff.  There are some excellent touches like the mini bar being restocked every day with free soft drinks and water.  We were offered a choice of soft drinks to take with us 'for the journey' when leaving the hotel, which indicates the care they take of you.
The only disappointment, for us, was the Le Market restaurant where we experienced cold food and poor service.  But I can only assume it was a bad night.  Next door is the Sofitel Royal Bay which is more lively than the Thalassa which you might or might not like.  The SoGood restaurant was exceptional and good value considering the quality.
The hotel is at the south end of the promenade which is quieter but a few kilometres from the 'centre' of town and the Marina.  Taxi's are cheap.  However the further away you wonder from the hotel the 'less sophisticated' if feels.  But Agadir is a quality beach resort.  It is very easy to spend the whole day at the Thalassa, and we would have loved to have stayed another week, a rare recommendation from us.

You do have to make sure you are understood as English is third language.  We booked a trip to Taroudant at the hotel and asked for an English speaking guide.  The guide spoke no English.

The stylish rooms come with a kettle.  The bed is very, very, comfortable.  The free Wi-Fi has to restarted on your device after 12 hours as it disconnects. Room service is ultra quick."
"I recently stayed in this hotel and I truly liked it.

The hotel is nicely situated at the sea with a superb terrace and beautiful sea views. The rooms are well appointed but slightly on the small side and with indirect sea views. A complimentary mini bar with soft drinks is a nice gesture, but given the room price one shouldn't expects less.

All staff are very friendly and helpful. You really feel welcome at this place. Especially the night concierge is a lovely guy.

I only had dinner on Friday evening, and this was a buffet. Before entering the restaurant I thought I'd landed in a private function in the hallway but was quickly greeted by Mr. Raphael Mukarji who invited me to this weekly cocktail function they arrange for their guests. Mes compliments Mr. Mukarji, bien fait! You feel treated like a real guest. 

The buffet was slightly disappointing. Starters consisted mainly of salads. My first bite in the fish fillet ended up with bones, so it was my last bite as well. The chicken however was boneless, as 
was the fillet of beef and both nice. Both the rice and potatoe dish were bland. Desserts were plenty and I had an average piece of cake (which looked far better than it tasted) and a good pear tart. Some room for improvement here for the singing head chef. Prices of wine are quite hefty, but this is what you can expect. However, MAD 70,00 for a small glass of Moroccan white is steep. Breakfast buffet was very nice, especially while sitting outside. However, this to comes with a price.

One complaint though, the airconditioning in my room didn't function properly.

All in all this is a 5 star hotel with 5 star prices. However, I'll rate it 4 star for the time being, as there is room for improvements. But at the same I would love to come back and add the 5th star to my next experience"
"After booking next door Sofitel Royal Bay Resort with Thomsons we were very very disappointed and moved to Sofitel Thalassa Sea and Spa Hotel next door. Fabulous hotel, excellent food in the restaurants and around the pool. Lovely pool area and service and private beach. The bedroom was good with an amazing shower and comfortable bed. Zara our cleaner was very efficient and polte.Another advantage was the mini bar was restocked every day with water and soft drinks free. Not much to do in Agadir but a beautiful beach and a great place to go for some sunshine before winter."
"What an amazing place and hotel. The beach is right at your door step and the hotel restaurant serves amazing food. Great value for money. The spa and Hamama is an experience not to miss. Agadir is a lovely city offering great food, good night life, great shopping and so much to see and do."
"I stayed here with my son last week. We stayed for 3 nights for a short break and it was just what we needed. The hotel is away from the hustle and bustle of the promenade and has a private beach with very comfortable beds that have cover for when it is too hot.  It is much quieter and just what we were after. The whole hotel has a very luxurious feel. We were fortunate to be upgraded to a prestige suite which had the most amazing view of the sea from the massive terrace. The management at the hotel were exceptional, especially Bouttanya and Ousman. We felt very well looked after and had a relaxing holiday."
">Great location.
>The loveliest girl in the reception ""nora"" was very friendly and she has been wonderful helping us.THANK YOU!
>Great and fast service in the restaurant.Top waiters!
>The pool staff were so attentive and willing to help; a very special thank you to the most funny and adorable ""BOUJMA""...

We will definitely come back"
"Back at the Sofitel after about a year since last stay. Under the new management the hotel has maintained its high standard. Still a great staff all the way from house cleaning to top management. 
Enjoyed my stay in the quiet surroundings with easy access to the beach and pool areas. No need to go out to eat, since the kitchen is producing superb meals from breakfast to dinner.
I wholeheartedly reccommend this great spot."
"This hotel is situated at the very end of the prom in Agadir and is a good 30 minute walk to the main strip and another 20 minutes to the marina area.  If you don’t like walking you can take a taxi (only €2 to centre of Agadir).  The hotel has direct access to the beach and there are lots of sunbeds available both at the beach and in the pool area. When we were there in Sept it was quite windy on the beach but you could get shelter by the pool. The communal areas are kept spotlessly clean and the gardens are very well maintained.
We stayed for 7 days   - the check in was slow (but I found this in the other 4 hotels we stayed in). Overall, we were happy with the accommodation, the room was cleared daily, the mini bar replenished most days however, the turn down service was not consistent  – some nights we got it other nights we didn’t.  The breakfast was excellent with a huge variety of food available.  We ate lunch in the pool bar and the L’Atlantique restaurant 5 of the 7 days and was not impressed with the offering so did not bother eating in the hotel in the evenings. Also the service was really slow and you often had to remind staff that you were waiting for a coffee / glass of wine etc.  We ate in the So Good & La Nasse (Sofitel Royal Bay beside Thalassa Spa) and would not return to either. We ate in Riad Villa Blanche, Little Norway, La Scala, Le Quay, Jardin D’eau, La Madrague and would return to any of these restaurants.
I would happily spend another week in this hotel – though it is annoying to pay 5 star prices and not get 5 star service."
"We have stayed for 10 nights. The staff was very helpfull and kind. They made our stay relaxing and a perfect holiday. We went golfing 4 times. The hotel booked our golf and a shuttle bus drove us. Diner was every night different, many choices and tastefull."
"We have just returned from our holiday September 2013 and stayed at this amazing hotel which exceeded our expectations by far.
From the minute you arrive,  from the door staff to the reception staff, we were greeted with a refreshing Morroccan whiskey (mint tea) and some complimentary  patisseries and a warm smile.
The comprehensive knowledge of Bacha the concierge,  who went out of his way to make our stay exceptional as well as all the other staff.
During our stay, we experienced that not only all the staff going the extra mile, but also that senior management were extremely hands on in making everyones stay enjoyable and special. You know who you are Raphael :)
This was most definitely 5 star at its best"
"I take myself on a spa holiday every year to unwind and recharge. I have been to France, Tunisia, the Carribeans, South East Asia. This year I chose the Sofitel Thalassa & Spa in Agadir. It was trully the best spa holiday I have ever experienced. This hotel is all about water: a great pool, the idyllic setting at the end of Agadir's long strech of sandy beach, an amazing spa which combines local rituals (Hammam) and traditional spa treatments... I was in water heaven for a week! I booked a package that entitled me to half board and 24 spa treatments (Cure Remise en Forme). Laila at the spa front desk was so lovely, she let me change my schedule and some of my treatments several times, working hard and always succeeding in accommodating me. The highlight for me was Fatima's black soap rub and scrub and generally speaking the overall Hammam experience.
In the interest of fairness, I do need to mention though that as far as 5* standards go, this is not the best hotel I've experienced, but then again having travelled to South East Asia extensively I guess I have been spoilt in the past. Specifically, I feel the evening buffet wasn't of 5* quality, there was a lack of turning down service for the first 4 days, I had to send back a couple of cocktails, little things really but in my opinion, it's the details that make the difference. Call me demanding!
I am confident that these little things can be improved over time and have already made up my mind to go back next year.
In summary, if you're after the perfect beach location, great spa treatments and value for money, don't hesitate, this is the place.
"
"Overall myself and a friend enjoyed our stay very much at the Thalassa.  We left very relaxed and chilled.  
The only negatives for us was considering the hotel was very low in capacity we were put in a room miles away from the main complex and that sometimes the staff were enjoying the lack of guests a bit too much and we would wait quite a while for someone to assist us, or have to go inside to the bar / restaurant areas to ask to be served.  
The bedrooms were large and generaly comfortable, although the mattress topper was too soft and didnt give us the restful sleep we were hoping for.
All in all we are just really nit-picking at the faults.  We would definitely go back with friends and family included, particularly as the hotel was very welcoming of children.  From what we saw around Agidir Thalassa is definitely the premium hotel in the area by quite a distance."
"If you're new to holidaying in Agadir it's worth preparing yourself for the sea mist. In our one week stay we experienced three days with hardly any sun, it was still warm and didn't bother us, but one of the main things you want from a foreign holiday is sunshine!

The hotel was beautiful and well designed. We took a walk along the promenade and considered ourselves thankful for our choice in hotel, very few could match it.
The hotel kindly upgraded our room on arrival, as it was the end of high season and few guests were there (which we loved) and the customer service was very good as a result.

Overall we found the hotel good value for money, especially for the large room we were given and the complimentary mini bar, espresso and tea facilities in the room.
- remember to tip the mini bar guy so he comes by daily.

The pool/ lunch menu is overpriced for what it is, we ventured to the hotel next door most lunch times.
The hotel buffet dinner (just shy of thirty quid) was great, and the female run restaurant opposite also good, but more worth a visit for its beautiful decor.

Must say, our favourite place for dinner was the Riad blanche at the top of the hill, no more than five minutes walk from the hotel.

Our spa treatment was good. I'd recommend paying the 200 dirhams for the use of the high tech spa pool and steam room access.. Very relaxing and affordable.

We enjoyed our stay and returned home very relaxed, so thank you Sofitel!
I'd go back, but never in peak season, I think it'd lose it's charm.

"Arrived after a easy drive from Marrakech on an empty motorway thru dramatic scenery of the Atlas
Really happy with the location on a private beach with no road to cross to get in the sea
First time its happened to me,,when I checked in told we were guests of the day/week so upgraded to 80 sq m suite which was great,funky lights in shower, large terrace with sea view,free soft drinks coffee etc WiFI free and efficient many hotels could learn from this!
The bed like most sofitls was supremely comfortable
Went to pool side restaurant for 15.00 lunch superb oysters but it is a new season followed by delicious fish and 2 bottles of good Moroccan gris
Whilst there we had a hamman and massage great spar also aqua gym which for me was new
That evening Elena was given a bunch of roses and we got a free 1/2 bottle of Champagne , 80 euros on the carte  
Loved the beach,sea service food room ,in fact can't wait to have another w/e there"
"We just spent ten days at the Sofitel Agadir Thalassa Sea & Spa (August 27th – September 6th) and here is our review.

General feeling : great hotel, very modern but with a sort of Moroccan spirit in the architecture. Main colors are white and black, with fountains, waterfall, and the likes. Basically, this new Sofitel is clearly in the line of the recent openings of the brand elsewhere.

Situation and premises : the hotel is situated at the end of the Agadir’s promenade, meaning that there is some walk to reach out restaurants and animated places (5 minutes by taxi, or a 30 minutes’ walk). This is a good thing if you are looking for calm. The hotel building is formed as a sort of ‘u’ (with 2 floors) in front of the ocean. In the middle, there is the pool area, some gardens and a restaurant. The hotel has a direct access to the beach (this is the only one in Agadir to have this privilege so far as we know) where some space are privative for hotels guests. 

Rooms : as a Platinum Le Club Accor member, we were upgraded in a Deluxe room with a full ocean view (rooms have normally a lateral pool/ocean view, except 5 of them, which are more expensive). The room was modern, with the bathroom being in front of the bed, and aligned to the ocean view. That means that when you take a shower (there is no bath) you see the ocean – in the morning or in the evening, this is particularly great. The bed is a MyBed one with full comfort. There is a flat-TV with a lot of different channels. The room is also wifi-friendly with a very decent connection (free). There is a mini-bar (free, refilled daily) with different non-alcoholic beverages. There are also coffee/tea facilities, but as written previously by someone else, we find it strange that those are not Nespresso ones as in other Sofitel elsewhere. As our room was on 2nd floor, we were not distributed by any noise. There is also a terrace, with seating facilities ; it was however very difficult to use because of the (strong) wind coming from the ocean ; some kind of ‘glass’ protection (on the barrier) would have been very useful. Bathroom amenities were Lanvin ones – no idea why we did not get the usual Hermes ones. The turn-down service is great (when they don’t forget to provide it) as they prepare the room for the night. Cleaning services were fine ; but don’t hesitate to speak with the personnel to get what you need (if you don’t, well, you could face some issues – see below). All in all, the room is typically what you can expect from a recent Sofitel. 

Restaurants & bar : we tested “The Market” which is the buffet restaurant for breakfast and dinner ; enough choices and great food, supervised by Executive Chef Martial Clément – a very nice person. Prices are in line with other Sofitel : 22 EUR for breakfast, and 35 EUR for dinner (excl. beverages). We also tried the pool restaurant for snacking : plenty of choices (salted or sugared food) at reasonable prices. We did not tried the Moroccan food restaurant lead by Chef Fatima Tagra, but her reputation is great. There is also the hotel bar where a couple of singers/music players come every nights – if those guys are really kind, the sound is too jazzy, and there are not a lot of people around.

Pool & beach : the pool is at the heart of the hotel. Very nice looking. There are seating facilities all around, and as the hotel was far from being crowded, you find your place quite easily. Two issues, however : 1- the wind remains quite strong, even in this area (the ocean is not far away) ; that causes the umbrellas to fall/fly away, which could be pretty dangerous ; I would suggest that the hotel changes those pools umbrellas by some that cannot fly away in case of wind (if someone gets it on his/her neck, that would be more than painful). 2- the service varies a lot from one personnel to another : some personnel are talking together, ignoring arriving guests or guests fighting with the above mentioned umbrellas ; when you ask for something, they forget half of it, and execute the other one the wrong way ; other personnel (for instance lifeguard Youssef) are really attentive and kind, and look to help you ; probably the staff needs more training so to reach the ‘next step’ which guests are expecting for a 5 stars Sofitel hotel (i.e. the personnel considers you as a guest, accompanies your needs and anticipates your requests by taking the initiative).

Spa & fitness : we didn’t tried the spa facilities, so we cannot comment. We however tried the So Fit room (fitness) : this is a modern place to make fitness ; one or two guys are there if you need help ; however, if you don’t ask, they don’t do anything (see next point).

Service & personnel : this is the weak point. The hotel opened pretty recently (March) and some personnel still need to be trained ; there are a lot of personnel around ; while some are really taking care of guests, other speak together, and forget that they should take care of guests. This has been observed at any time : breakfast (you don’t get your coffee or your juice, neither your basket of bread), pool (umbrellas, towels, food), dinner (plates, beverage), bar, room service, … To our opinion, the ‘Ambassadeurs’ (this is how they are named) are doing their best, but someone (really) needs to provide them with the appropriate strong training so that they realize what guests are expecting, and why a Sofitel is different from another brand. The issues we faced were so annoying, at some point, that we had a discussion with the person in charge of Guests Relations/Satisfactions (Sarah) and from that moment, we really saw that efforts were made and, sometimes, delivered. We however regret that we had to show that we were very annoyed by those issues (despite different signals delivered before to the Gust Services). 

Personal note : have a discussion with the hotel’s operating officer (COO), Raphael, who is a very remarkable person. We appreciated the conversations we had together during our stay, incl. the feedbacks shared on our experience. That would be wonderful if all personnel would have is ‘guests-minded’ orientation and understanding. His challenge is there : upgrade personnel’s capabilities to reach this ‘next step’. 

All-in-all : this is a Sofitel, providing more or less the same experience than other Sofitel elsewhere in the world. Premises and facilities are great, but service could be improved. We rate our experience there with a 4 for that reason."
"We stayed for 3 nights in August.  We didn't expect such cold persistent strong winds in the middle of August.  Nobody on Trip Advisor mentioned the wind factor in Agadir....!  

Hotel was beautiful and staff was attentive.  Free soft drinks in the room were convenient since there is no convenience store on premise or nearby.  It is located 30-40 min walk from the main touristy location which obviously has pluses and minuses.  Pool area was beautiful and nice beds all around.

We had lots of restaurants to choose from between the two Sofitels and we chose to dine next door mostly because prices were much cheaper for similar food. It has so much potential, but would like to see some improvements.

1.  Paint on the balcony was chipping already and flakes were falling on the floor.
2.  Rooms and hallways are too dark - black ceilings and floors are too oppressive.  
3.  Sun beds did not have secure curtains so easily flopping in the wind.  Sofitel Royal next door had better beds with shades that were secured to the beds. 
4.  Room design is odd.  The bed is in the middle of the room with passageways on either side so feel like you are sleeping in a hallway.  Basically, the room is too narrow.  
5.  Room service was spotty.  We asked for more creamer for morning coffee, but the request was ignored all together.  Very odd.  

We would come back to this hotel again because we enjoyed having both Sofitels available to us and Thalassa was quieter and newer.  
"
"A very comfortable , modern hotel with extremely  professional, helpful and  friendly  staff . Rooms were comfortable and nicely furnished . The food in all restaurants was excellent . We loved  the  swimming pool ."
"Just returned from 8 nights at the Sofitel Thalassa Sea and Spa and have mixed feelings.
When we arrived I thought it all looked wonderful.
- the look of the hotel is stylish 
- the welcome was friendly and efficient
- the room had a great layout and design features (although the light switches took a little getting used to)
- outside areas were well designed and looked after
- quality of food was very good
- spa pool was impressive

But... there were a few things that began to take the shine off, such as
- the cleaning service was very hit and miss, under the bed was filthy (only noticed as I dropped something under there - found a bracelet from a previous resident!)
- the fridge, although a great bonus, wasn't replenished daily so we were often without water, tea or milk which was annoying
- the pool staff were never that attentive, which wasn't that problematic as we're capable of setting ourselves up, but when there were no clean towels out and we asked for some I watched the member of staff walk to the end of the pool, take towels off 2 beds then walk around the corner and fold them back up so they looked new then give them to his colleague to give to us, to give the impression they were clean! This really didn't impress and when I pulled him up on it he feigned ignorance so I demanded he got clean towels from the spa, after all who wants to lie on used towels!!!
- also every day, due to an allergy, we asked for a club sandwich without egg for lunch and this was only done 2 out of 5 times... really shouldn't be that hard.
- in the buffet restaurant for dinner we would be waiting for ages before we could order a drink, most of the time we would have to wave frantically to get someone's attention.
- and lastly, I'm afraid to say it, if you don't speak French or have children, you are somewhat invisible... and on the subject of children, there were quite a few more than we expected at a hotel which really should be adults only, as there are no facilities for the little darlings. So if you're going as a couple for a romantic break beware that there will be children whose parents don't seem to care about it being your one week of the year to relax in peace and quiet!

So, little things, but when you're paying for 5 star you expect 5 star service, and the Sofitel Thalassa Sea and Spa just didn't quite deliver so I'm not sure I'd return. Having experienced top service at other 5 star hotels I can honestly say that this is more important than double sun loungers or designer hanging chairs... although these are nice too!

And beware the Agadir mist! We had no idea about it prior to booking but after 3 days of cold grey weather we are certainly aware of it now!

Note: don't book the transfers though Expedia with Sahara, they were rather shabby"
"We visited this hotel last year as a couple and this year returned as a family with older teenagers. We arranged our stay with the hotel directly and were met at Agadir airport by a car arranged by the hotel. Check in was simple and were soon occupying 3 rooms on the first floor with ocean views. These were very quiet with a pleasant breeze looking away from the main town of Agadir.

Buffet breakfasts were as good as last time but sometimes it wasn't so easy to find some items. It was only after the third day we found the daily selection of smoothies!

The pool area was perfectly clean at all times - both in and out of the water. The staff had genuine pride at keeping their section of the hotel clean. Service was attentive but not intrusive and drinks and food served promptly.

The spa was used by all 5 in our family at different times. They are very keen to please but on a couple of occasions there was a communication breakdown regarding the types of treatment due to language. My poor French probably but it was soon sorted out.

We used the concierge service to book a quad biking excurson. Note it is 'Le Quad' not 'quad bikes' otherwise you will end up with four bicycles, as we did! Once remedied, we went to a nearby beach where the quads were well maintained and the excursion took us along the beach, through the dunes and up into the Atlas mountains. It was a really good trip, particluarly as we did not know what to expect.

I am unsure about a previous comment about the evening buffet. We had the chnace to eat out each night but all the family preferred the choices offered in the hotel. The area was hygienically clean, staff very careful with cooking and serving and a wide range of local and international foods available each day. The younger ones in our group also had oysters for the first time one night but not sure they were to their liking. We however thought them excellent.

The manager and his senior staff were visble throughout our stay and were interested in our experiences. A couple of thing we noted to them were immediately rectified. It was apparent they were striving for the highest standards possible.

We enjoyed our time there and hope to return soon."
"This hotel is absolutely amazing - well worth every single penny. 

We stayed here on a Half board basis - highly recommended.  

The breakfasts were fresh, and eggs, pancakes etc cooked right in front of you - plenty of fresh fruit juices available and fresh bread and  fruit stations too.

Dinner was fantastic - freshly cooked in front of you, steaks, chicken, vegetables, mash, whatever you want.

All staff were attentive and friendly without being over-friendly as can be found in many hotels in Agadir!

The rooms are nothing short of sumptuous - the bed is amazingly comfortable with a wonderful balcony - mine overlooked the sand dunes outside and beach.  The fridge was stocked with all sorts of fruit juices and water which was replenished free of charge each day. The shower is amazing and changes colour - there's room for at least 3 people!

On arrival I was met with complimentary wine and cakes/sweets.

Probably the most expensive hotel I have ever stayed at, but worth it  - it definitely gave me a taste of the 5 star treatment!

Would go again in a heartbeat."
"Just had a wonderful family hotel at this luxurious new hotel. Staff were exceptionally friendly, rooms were perfect. Could not recommend this hotel enough if you are looking for some relaxation in a perfect setting."
"I've spent another days in May at Sofitel Thalassa Sea and Spa in Agadir.

The weather was great, very sunny, hot, the private beach is amazing, and what a joy to walk in the morning in the waves, through this long and wonderful beach !

The hotel is very modern, with luxury bedrooms, try the ones with terrace on the sea.
The all hotel is very clean, the breakfast at the buffet is delightfull with lots of fresh fruits, morocan pastries, all sorts of fruits juices and everything to get satisfied.
The bar is huge, with elegant furniture, all the gardens are cleaned everyday, it's reallly beautiful.

The staff is nice, friendly and helpfull.
We've had our lunch at the Atlantic, and the staff guys were as friendly as before, the had nice little attentions for us and it was lovely.

It's a perfect getway from stress and work for a week or less, not too far by plane from Europe, with sunny beach and another culture as well."
"This hotel was a wonderful oasis for a short holiday with guaranteed sun. The place was spotlessly clean and very modern with some amazing design details in all of the public areas and in the rooms. Wherever you go it feels luxurious and well attended. Every single member of staff is more than ready to help with a smile, with the highest degree of service in mind. If you want to be left alone no problem, if you want help in any way no problem with that as well. There are some small niggles with the property like the cost of some of the food in particular, it is lovely and of good quality but not perhaps to the standard of the cost. Very aligned with major cities cost not the middle of Agadir. There is a fantastic breakfast place a very short walk along the promenade that considerably helped offset the buffet breakfast cost for us. Also make sure you check out the villa Blanche restaurant next door. Fabulous food and much better wine. one thing not to miss is the nightly entertainment in the medicine bar - great musicians/singer in a wonderfull setting as the sun goes down. Grab a cocktail and relax. "
"This is a very good hotel. We had a very nice stay, the staff were all friendly and courteous. We used many of the facilties including the gym and tennis. I particularly enjoyed the yoga classes run twice daily by Melodie who was an excellent teacher and very encouraging and helpful, the added bonus was that they were free. The food poolside was tasty and reasonably priced. We liked the fact that at night we could also eat at the neighbouring Sofitel hotel which widened the choice and price range of food. We felt that at our hotel the choice of restaurant was limited and the fine dining restaurant was overpriced. A note of caution when booking  your room, we booked online an ocean side room and had to lean out over our balcony to get a peep of the sea which was very disappointing but when we complained we were moved to a room overlooking the pool and ocean so I would recommend booking a room overlooking the pool."
"The staff were so welcoming, the hotel is just magnificent - although quite dark! The bedrooms take your breath away. Food here is very good, an excellent breakfast. I like the way that water and soft drinks are in the refrigerator and are complementary.
The bar is friendly, a wonderful little lady called Fatima was working whilst I had a few drinks with friends.
The concierge kindly connected my mobile to WiFi when I was struggling with technology.
Sofitel sits on it's own private beach, it has a heated pool and an incredible Spa.
this is the perfect hotel to stay at if you want real luxury and friendly helpful service. Management you are very good you lead by example!"
"Very pleasant stay extremely  courteous staff  needing some guidance at restaurants, very nice pool and facilities.the only minus is the darkness of the corridors, black is the colour of the hotel! Highly recommend  Sofitel  Thalassa and Spa"
"It is a paradisiac place, i will definitely go there again. One of the best hotels i ever stayed in my life!

The wifi in the room was great.

The personnel is fabulous and very professional.

The hotel is overall In excellent condition and very clean! 

The restaurant is a bit dark and rather expensive, although i have to admit of high quality!"
"My husband and I went to stay at the Thalassa Spa for a week from the 25th of March 2013.  The arrival area was impressive and you were immediately swept into the cool reception area and served with Moroccan tea, pastries and bottles of water with hot towels to, perfect after a long journey from Gatwick.  There was an air of relaxed elegance and a definite feeling of a luxurey 5* hotel.  Our room was beautiful with a large very comfortable bed, lovely modern bathroom facilities, great view of the swimming pool and sea, comfortable balcony area with day bed/sofa to lounge on and more or less everything you would need in a room for a comfy stay.  The only problem was trying to get out of bed in the morning as the curtains were very effective at keeping the light out.  The pool area was spotless as were any of the communal areas I witnessed at the hotel, the staff were polite and very friendly and nothing was too much trouble for them.  Around the pool we were very spoilt with being greeted in the morning and escorted to a lovely sunbed with fresh towels laid out for us and canopies to keep us from the sun if we needed.  We were then asked what else we needed in the way of refreshments etc. even a table would be brought over to have your food on so you didn't need to move a muscle if you didnt want to. We liked getting a taxi into the Marina area at night and found a nice restaurant called the madrague which did great seafood and also a variety of other things like burgers, steak, chicken and pastas etc.  We also ate at the Market in the hotel which was very nice buffet style and friendly chefs to allow you have whatever you wanted.  I thought I was in paradise every morning when I woke up in a dark room, pulled back the curtains to see an immaculate garden and pool area, beautiful blue sky, crashing waves and soft breeze with birdsong in the distance.  It was the epitomy of what I would describe as the perfect relaxing holiday with pure luxury as well.  How often can you say that?  I have to mention Yassim at the pool for his amazing knowledge about almost every subject and his unfailing courtesy every moment of our holiday.  Also Marouane who worked at the Atlantique restaurant and was charming and funny and always had something interesting to talk about.  We were made to feel special by everybody there which is very rare these days in such a huge travel industry.  I will definitely return there again as I felt like it was a little haven, a gem in the Atlantic, with the warmth of the Moroccan people who we have found to be so welcoming to us in their country."
"I stayed in this resort for 9 days with my partner. The drive/entrance-way to the hotel was beautiful, especially in the early evening. Our room was gorgeous - huge comfortable bed, good sized shower with fun coloured lights. The decor of the room was elegant with a good hint of Moroccan charm. 

The beach was a bit dirty whilst we were there but we were told that this is because there was lots of rain around our stay. However, the section of the beach that was for the resort was spotless! This was a big plus point for us.

The outdoor pools were spotless. The staff were very attentive, especially then reception staff who were always on hand to give us recommendations for dinner as well as helping us to play various trips ( day trip to Marrakech and camel ride - both of which I would highly recommend).

The restaurants were expensive but the food was nice. We preferred the buffet style area as opposed to the dining room as the food was actually better and it felt less pretentious. 

I would definitely recommend staying at this hotel - it was beautiful."
"We spent a week at the Sofitel mid-March and it was *fantastic*. 

Best parts:
- our room : we had a junior suite overlooking the pool with direct views to the sea. Massive balcony with a day bed, enormous room, great shower, comfiest bed I've slept in for a long time
- weather : sunny, warm delicious sea breeze. Need I say more when the UK is in the grip of some kind of mini ice age
- staff : exceptionally efficient and professional; every request was met in full and usually with a follow-up call to make sure we were satisfied
- pool area : extremely luxurious with cabana beds and great service on towels and refreshments 

The hotel itself is new and very stylish. Everything is immaculately clean and well maintained. The clientele is mainly French and quite chic/elegant. People dress nicely for all meals including breakfast. 
The gym and spa were wonderful, great facilities. 

Bits I was not so keen on:
- there were quite a few families with little babies and children who screamed and cried around the pool. It's not an adults-only hotel, but maybe it should be... it doesn't feel like a family vibe being so stylish and quite minimalistic. I am sure that families are welcomed...but if I were the management I would try to create a quiet zone somewhere in the pool or grounds so your sunbathing/relaxing is not interrupted by screaming children
- the beach is not pretty. The sand is dark and there is some construction happening there. Also the sea is rough & choppy, being the Atlantic. If you are after a beach holiday, this is not the one for you
- food & drink is shockingly expensive. We were on half board so had breakfast & dinner included every day. For both meals there was plenty of choice, everything was of top quality and freshly prepared. However lunch by the pool cost in excess of €40 for the two of us every day, for just a salad and some fries and a soft drink. A glass of house wine was €7, a glass of champagne €30. We brought our own wine and had a couple of glasses in the room every evening which no one seemed to mind. We also brought our desserts up every evening to have on the balcony or while watching a movie and no one complained about that either. 

Couple of hints - if you are flying from the UK, try to go BA as the flight times are good and there is a lovely lounge at Agadir airport.  Bring plenty of warm clothes as evening and morning temperatures are chilly. The sun is extremely strong from 11 - 4, so pack high factors. 

Would I go back? 100% YES, no hesitation. A great holiday and we have been to many 5* resorts."
"Spent a week here at the beginning of March. It was utter perfectiom from beginning to end. The staff are amazing and cannt do enough to make your stay as comfortable as possible. If you need something, you ask and you have it. The hotel itself is just beautifully decorated and very clean. The reception staff in particular Sara and Malika were wonderfully helpful. The Doorman Yassine was fantastic and the pool staff particulary Yassine and Moussa very attentive. The weather was not brilliant the week we went, but in a hotel as gorgeous as this is didnt stop us enjoying our week. The bedrooms are just so comfortable, beds that you just dont want to get out of and we were welcomed to the room with a lovely complementary bottle of wine and snacks. The mini bar is an amazing bonus as all soft drinks in here are free of charge and replenished on a daily basis, as is bottled water!! 

The evening dinners were gorgeous and each dish freshly prepared for you on order, breakfast could be a little bit chaotic and maybe needs a little tweeking when being seated, but this didnt bother us too much. 

Really loved the pool area and again the sunbeds and clean fresh towels were fantastic.

Would definately recommend this hotel to anyone and really would look forward to returning here for another week of relaxation for myself in the future"
"Hi, i spent 4 nights 'solo' at Sofitel Agadir Thalassa Sea & Spa and really were unforgattable,
The Hotel is just amazing,
If your are looking for comfort and relaxation, it's the best and the one.
The location is also perfect just near the beach and Marina. 
The quality of service is high, and the team is just friendly
When your are in need of anything they are just at your service.
Food is excellent.
And please, if your are visiting Sofitel Agadir Thalassa Sea & Spa, just don't forget to go to the spa center, they will take care of you and they will offer you many refreshing spa treatment, you will never regret it.
I've enjoyed everything and had the best time ever.
I highly recommend it.
I'm sure i will go back there."
"Quite simply I cannot fault this hotel. If you are looking for a relaxed and restful break then you could do a lot worse than stay at the Sofitel Agadir Thalassa Sea & Spa.

From the moment you arrive you are treated professionally by friendly and helpful staff who invariably have a smile on their faces. You need to remember that in North Africa, French is spoken virtually as the main language but English much less so. This can lead to some misunderstanding in trying to communicate in English, and any difficulties encountered can be because of this problem. However, there are enough members of staff who can speak English to resolve any problems, particularly given the pleasant nature of the Moroccan people.

Breakfast is terrific with plenty of choice of fruit, hot and cold dishes, pastries, etc. The hot food is cooked to order for you as you make your choice, from bacon, eggs, sausage, etc or if you prefer pancakes, which again are cooked to order, or both it is your choice. Service in the breakfast is in the main very good, but as always this will depend on the individual who is looking after you with some better than others,
 
The hotel is very modern, but with an unmistakable Moroccan flavour. The rooms have everything you need together with a complementary mini-fridge service.

I would certainly have no hesitation in returning to this hotel, although in my opinion I would say that the hotel is more suited to couples rather than families."
"Got off to a bad start when we arrived at the Hotel but thankfully our problems were promptly resolved by Sara from guest services who continued to be on hand to deal with any questions throughout our stay, many thanks Sara,
The holiday itself was wonderfully relaxing, all the staff were polite and helpful and could not do enough for you. The food was excellent, something for all tastes. I must mention Ilham, she would always greet us with a smile at breakfast and go out of her way to look after us. 
I would highly recommend this hotel if you want a very relaxing stressfree holiday."
"We had booked the old Sofitel in Agadir, but when arrived we found that we had been upgraded to the new one.
The hotel is very modern, with however a Moroccan soul.
We found the room comfortable; with a nice terrace overlooking the gardens and partially the sea.
The main restaurant was very good, with plenty of options both at breakfast and dinner.
The staff was great, from housekeeping to pool attendants, from waiters to receptionists, every body was helpful and friendly.
Overall a very good stay.
I recommend this hotel for anybody who is looking for comfort, relax and friendly service."
"We stayed in the new Sofitel 5 star hotel in Agadir Morocco near the beach and we had the best time ever, best hotel we ever stayed in, very friendly, excellent service, delicious food, beautiful pool and surroundings very helpful staff, the bedroom was very spacious and luxurious, bathroom quite large, spotless all the time, lovely balcony off the bedroom, very quite environment, over all excellent value for the deal we have been offered, we highly recommend it, will go again in the near future."
"This hotel is brand new and is next to the older Sofitel which is currently being renovated. It is at the end of the 'strip' so is quieter and more private than any of the other hotels.  Our accommodation was really luxurious, with a separate bed area, dressing room, beautiful and spacious bathroom, and a fabulous living area with comfortable seating and dining table.  It was really beautifully decorated. The highlight  was the terrace, with its own Moroccan style double bed and plenty of other seating, overlooking sea and pool.  However, even with a smaller room, the hotel has plenty of outdoor spaces where you can eat, sit and read or sunbathe. The pool area is dotted with big Moroccan beds with removable canopies, with luxurious reclining sunbeds and with comfortable outdoor seating--all of really 5* quality (and not too crowded together). The beach area is also fitted out beautifully and the quality of is far beyond the other nearby hotels.  There are plenty of staff throughout the hotel so there is never any waiting if you need something.  We found that they were exceptionally friendly and very well trained so that the service was top notch. The decor in the reception, corridor and bar areas were a little glitzy--dramatic rather than cozy--but this is just personal taste. They were certainly done to a very high standard and with a sense of style. The breakfasts were marvelous! Our room was fantastic. Fast broadband throughout, and at no extra charge. The level of service, from the moment you were met at the door, was exceptional."
"Splendid stay in a lovely setting
The hotel is set in beach side location and the grounds are impeccable, very well looked after.
Our room was on the first floor with a pool and distant sea view... beautiful. The decor very contemporary and clean and the tea making set in the room was a must as it got quite chilly in the evenings.
The choice of food in the Le Market restaurant is excellent,  fresh and tasty, the breakfast is just as good!
The food in the fine dining restaurant Le Palais Du Jardin was an anticlimax, we expected it to be well above the quality and flavours we were already used to in the Market restaurant but we found the food quite bland and uninspiring. 
Staff in the pool area are attentive and very friendly while staff in other areas are a bit hit and miss but that said, we've got no complaints."
"The rooms are well designed, also the rest from the hotel. We love to be arround the pool on the romantic beds. the rooms are clean and you get a refill for the mini bar every day. the buffet is in a good qualitiy, there are two buffets. 

one mixed one and one with traditionell marrocian food. They both good, but we feel that the price with 350 DH too much without drinks. The Breakfast Buffet is very good, a lot of fresh things, different kind of coffee and freh juices are avaible.

You have Wifi in the whole Hotel for free, whats really good, also the TV Programm is with al lot of channels, like a few german channels.

There are two problems, one is that a lot of the people only speak french or bad english. that makes it not so easy to order things. sometimes you have to wait for things you order a long time or they forget it. the tables are clean very soon, even if you are not finish and you are still to catch new things on the buffet. that should be better to organise, also that not all the things you need are on the table, like butter or salt and pepper. The workers are very helpfull and friendly, in most of the time the understanding is the problem.

the other thing is, that the corridor outside from the living-rooms are not clean the whole week. we think for a 5 star resort it should be.

In total we think its one of the best resorts in agadir, but there are still things to make better."
"From the moment we walked in to the ""scented"" lobby, to the time we left, we really felt we were in a very upmarket hotel.  So much so, that our clothes were really not suitable!!
From check in (hot towels, mint tea) to our room (moroccan treats, bottle of red wine, complimentary soft drinks) to the bathroom (hot towel rail, great magnifying mirror, L'Occitane products, soft towelling robes, coloured lit rainfall shower etc.) and the bed (comfortable) we really enjoyed our stay here.  
Yes, breakfast was a bit hit and miss, but you're on holidays so you really are not under pressure for time, and the variety of food on offer was always good.  I think it depended on what section you sat for  breakfast, but when we were nearer the food end, we had full/better service than when we were seated nearer the entrance.  Small things like napkins and cutlery missing were irksome,  but nothing that if you got up and went to another table, you could get yourself.
The hotel is far away from the main ""strip"", but this makes for a very pleasant stroll along the seafront or the promenade home, in the evenings. 
We only ate breakfast here so I can't comment on dinner etc. but the restaurant looked extremely upmarket - and as I said, we didn't have suitable attire.
The bar was strange - lots of curtained off areas, that would make it difficult to see if there was anyone else there at all - more like an airline lounge with curtains, than a bar I think.
Staff seem to speak French most, if not all of the time, and while I have very good French my husband doesn't, so he really found it hard to order a coffee or even water.  When they saw he was not understanding what he said, they would speak English, but it took a while for staff to understand that this was needed rather than optional.  Also, in the spa the staff really struggled with English, and I struggled with French words for beauty treatments, so that could be improved upon.
Worth a trip once in your life though!"
"We stayed here last week for three days.  I must start by commenting on the service from the staff.  Before we arrived we had read some reviews here regarding service at breakfast times so went with the attitude of 'we are in no hurry if it is a little slow'.  I can truly say the service was excellent.  We were shown to a table immediately, there was no waiting at all for coffee and there were plenty of staff on hand. The managers, like those of a true 5 star hotel, must have taken those very few negative comments on board because there was no sign whatsoever or any service problems.  The breakfast was amazing, plenty, and I mean plenty, of everything from cooked breakfasts, fresh pancakes, huge selection of pastries, fruit, cheese, meats, cake, bread, yogurts etc. it was all beautifully laid out and prepared.  The hotel is wonderful. We arrived and were led to a huge sofa and then brought hot towels to refresh ourselves and a selection of  Moroccan treats and Mint tea was brought out.  A lovely lady on reception copied our passports and we were show to our room.  We had a delux sea view room and it was wonderful. A complimentary mini bar,with soft drinks, replenished daily, was waiting together with a bottle of wine (did not drink it but it was probably a good one) and a tray of  cakes and macaroons.  The shower with its different coloured lighting was great, as we're the toiletries. The bed was lovely and soft and the bathrobes and slippers were lovely.  We had a big big balcony with plenty of seating. The staff really are so very friendly and helpful. Nothing was too much for them, from the cleaners upwards, they were always very polite and we were made to feel very welcome from the moment we stepped into the beautiful lobby.  The restaurants looked very nice although we did not eat dinner at the hotel but I  can imagine it would be excellent food. The pool area was perfect, plenty of lovely sun loungers and towels provided and staff checking and delivering drinks and food if ordered. We visited the spa, for the Hamman and pool which again was great.  We love travelling and visit places that other people have recommended here on tripadviser regardless of its star rating but I have to admit this was the best hotel I have stayed in. We make a point of not staying at the same area and hotel more than once as there are many places we still want to see but have both agreed we will go back here again for some winter sun and to be thoroughly spoilt. If you have any questions about anything please ask away. Have a lovely time if you have booked to stay here, if not, consider booking, you will love it."
"Just back from a week's holiday in the Sofitel. My husband had phoned hotel directly to ensure we had enough space in room, for our two little boys (2yr & 4yr). But upon arrival receptionist advised it would be too small. We ended up having to upgrade to a larger suite 027 instead which usually run to 900 per night at a discounted rate. But still a lot more than we had planned on spending.
The hotel is geared up for adults but our children were made a fuss over everywhere we went as the staff were lovely. They are pretty well behaved and small but older and louder would have made me self conscious. 
I agree with the other reviewers about the food. Excellent but too expensive. 19euro for sandwiches at the pool!! Its at the end of the promenade with not a whole lot nearby so you are a bit captive on that score
Pool are was gorgeous. Free mini bar a welcome touch.
Spa treatments were wonderful. Very good therapists. Lovely hairdressers. Small but nice gym"
"The staff are very helpful, especially the pool attendants, namely yacine, pool supervisor.  Boujemzz pool butler, very helpful and very attentive, nothing was too much trouble!  Poolside food is overpriced at twenty for a burger and water.  

Breakfast buffet is par excellance, huge choice of hot and cold dishes.  Breakfast staff in need of more training, need to have more waiting staff that speak, or at least understand english.  As my french is not at all good.  The tea and coffee station must be a long way from the dining room, as it takes a while to be served, we thought they had gone to marrekesh for it.

We were lucky enough to be upgraded to a beautiful suite.  Very luxuries, great views, excellent quality bedding and a extremely comfortable bed.  Fresh bottled water on a daily basis, complementary, mini fridge also had coke, juices etc all gratis

Evening entertainment is a singer in the bar area, singer finishes by 11:30 with the bar closing shortly afterwards.  Lacks ambiance/atmosphere gods waiting room!!

If you wish to dine out of the hotel we can recommend le quis at the marina, has great live music and excellent food at thirty pounds for an decent sized sole and half a bottle of good local wine called sahari reserve red or white, both very nice.

Petit red taxi always ask the cost before setting off, should cost 30 mad to marina from sofitel.

Spa is lovely, pricey but good for hair and nails.  Seawater bath area is free to use when paying for a treatment.

All in all, great hotel, great staff, and as arnie would say "" we'll be back""!!!!!!!
Thank you to eduardo for all his charming help and to mr white, the pool manager for being soooo good looking

Sue and christina
Ise of man"
"This week away was my Christmas gift from my partner, he wanted to give me some time and space to relax in the sun.
Sofitel did exactly that, from the moment we arrived and was offered hot towels, pappeint tea to refresh, to our first time round the pool where Yasmin the pool supervisor came over and welcomed us, and his team just were perfect in everyway, we didn't need to lift a finger, they were so attentive to our every needs. The private area on the beach offered a comfortable beach experience with luxurious beds available, towels provided and an incredible sea view.
We had a standard room, but again beautiful decor, really chic and extravagant, a double shower with delicious smelling gels and creams provided every day.
We paid a supplement to have dinner in the a la carte restaurant on our last night and was delighted with the ambiance and the quality of the meal , the 9 hour slow cooked lamb melted in my mouth and the puddings were a work of art.
If there was any negative comments at all, I think that the service in the buffet restaurant was a little inconsistent , the manager was delightful but it could be slow and the waiters could be forgetful, but in the scheme of things it was minor really, the good was great quality there was plenty of variety for meat, fish or veggies, I had a really spectacular pizza one night, freshly prepared in front of me.
I would really recommend this hotel and we would go back again"
"Just returned from a week's stay at the Thalassa Sea and Spa on the occasion of my wife's birthday and would like to thank all at the hotel for a fabulous stay. The hotel and facilities are stunning and the staff are all friendly and helpful. Yes, we did have to wait for morning coffee on a couple of occasions but this was a minor niggle and more than offset by the luxury surroundings and kindness of the staff. On the day of my wife's birthday a special cake and gifts were brought to our room and she was thrilled. Because we had been relocated from the Royal we were upgraded to a luxury suite and this was absolutely stunning. I really think some of the few negative comments I have seen are quite churlish and wonder if some people are ever pleased. A special thanks to Cyril, the restaurant manager, the lovely breakfast  baguette lady and omelette chef."
"I am currently staying at the Sofitel Thalassa, and i would recommand it to anyone looking for a restful break.
The hotel is new, and the staff very young and friendly.
Rooms are well kept and clean.We have a room on the second floor, and it is very comfortable.
I have tried the buffet restaurant and can say that anyone can find something tasteful to eat.
The Spa is beautiful, the gym well equipped and we really enjoy the heated swimming pool.
For sure we will come back to the Sofitel Thalassa if back to Agadir."
"This hotel is about a 30 minute walk to Agadir town centre. Very much a peaceful and relaxing holiday location with a very large pool area and private beach. 
The service was 99% of the time outstanding, and, if any comment was made the staff would resolve any issue in a prompt and efficient manner and this would exceed our expectations.  
The quality and cleanliness of the room was very high and we slept very well, I understand that our fellow travellers had wine and chocolates in their room maybe that was an oversight for us.
The food was always very good and a varied choice was readily available add this to the attentive waiters at either the restaurant or pool bar and you have a great experience.
The staff in the bar and the resident entertainment are in keeping with a mellow and relaxing resort.
There are many activities that can be arranged if relaxing by the pool is not your thing, however a point to note is that the holiday rep did not take card payment and there is not an ATM on site, so a tip might be to stop at the airport as you arrive and obtain cash.
I believe that if you allow the staff to welcome you into the Sofitel “family” at this resort you will have a truly great holiday."
"This is a new property (opened in 2012).  It has been designed to be a resort hotel, with heavy emphasis on the spa that is attached to the hotel.

It is a very attractive property, with elegant design, but it is not really suitable for business travelers. Rooms do not have proper desks in them, and the chairs and settees that are provided in the rooms are not suitable for use at a desk (i.e. while using a computer).  The architect put the emphasis on appearance, not practicality - all the chairs and settees have bases that are only about 18 inches off the ground, which is very 'Moroccan' looking, but totally useless for doing desk work.  If you didn't need a lower back massage when you arrived, you sure as heck will need one after squatting on one of these low stools for a couple of hours trying to get computer work done.

Breakfast was excellent - very good food, lots of variety - but the breakfast room needs to have a Maître d'Hôtel present to ensure that the staff pay attention to the guests.  I arrived in the breakfast room an hour after opening, and all the wait staff and chefs were fully focused on setting up tables and preparing their Mise-en-place.  It was necessary to get up and go search for a waiter to get a coffee, and stick my head into the kitchen and call out for a chef to prepare some eggs.  This is inexcusable, adult supervision of the breakfast room is essential.

The bed in the room was heavenly, and the entire property was immaculately clean.

All in all - a terrific place to go if you want a holiday, but not the best choice in town for the business traveler."
"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Sofitel. I have to say the employee service was outstanding, with nothing being too much trouble. While it's a little way away from the main part of Agadir, it's a very pleasant walk down the beach promenade or short petit taxi ride away. Food is fresh and beautifully presented. Rooms and the broader hotel are kept to a very high standard. Initially we had been placed in a room which overlooked the Sofitel next door, which was undergoing renovation, which was very noisy in the early in the morning. When we asked to move rooms, this was done quickly and without fuss. The only minor frustration (& it is minor) we had, was the long check in time. It can take about 10 - 15 mins while they serve Moroccan tea, local sweet treats and complete the necessary paperwork. While hospitable and welcoming, we just wanted to get to the room and sort ourselves out. Overall we had an outstanding week long break at this hotel. Outside of this minor issue, we couldn't have been happier with the service, experience and beauty of this place. We'd highly recommend this hotel to others looking for a little luxury and would definitely stay here again. A truly beautiful location with genuinely lovely staff."
