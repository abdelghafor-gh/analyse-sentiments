"We recently spent two nights at Riad Dar Rabha in Fes and had a wonderful experience. The riad itself is charming and offers a true taste of Moroccan hospitality.
Accommodation: The riad is beautifully decorated, blending traditional Moroccan aesthetics with modern comfort. Our room was cozy and elegantly furnished.
Service: The staff, especially Said, provided exceptional service. Said's warm welcome and attentiveness made our stay particularly memorable.
Hospitality: The overall hospitality was outstanding, with every need attended to promptly and courteously.
Conclusion:
I highly recommend Riad Dar Rabha to anyone visiting Fes. The combination of beautiful surroundings and excellent service, particularly from Said, ensures a delightful stay. Thank you to the entire team for their exceptional hospitality."
"We just loved our stay at Riad Dar Rabha. The Riad is quietly tucked away at the boarder of the old Medina, with easy access to the Medina and to taxis to get to wherever you need in the city. With our extended family we’ve rented almost the whole Riad to attend a wedding across a long weekend with different check-in and check-out dates seen we flew in from different locations. Karim and his staff have been the perfect hosts accommodating and attentive to all our needs. The Riad is private and a peaceful oasis and serves as the perfect escape from the busy Medina. The rooms are spacious, clean and the beds are comfortable. Each room has its own en suite bathroom. The staff serves each morning fresh traditional Morrocan breakfast. Karim knows the city like the back of his hands and serves as a perfect source of what to do or where to go in this bustling city. On my next visit to Fez, I will definitely go back to this great Riad, which I highly recommend!"
"In the center of the old medina in Fez, this multilevel building is a beautiful central courtyard of architectural interest. The room doors are surrounded by plaster friezes, stained glass windows tint the space, and marble lines the floor. The rooms are spacious with large windows looking into the courtyard. The bathroom is small, but sufficient, although nobody really uses shower curtains anywhere in Morocco. Hide items you don’t want to get wet! The central location is just minutes from one of the best hammam’s in the city, along with numerous restaurants. The breakfast was served on time, with so many options brought to the table that we were quite overwhelmed with the hospitality. WiFi is reliable as is electricity and water! "
"SP: Me sumo a todos los comemtarios súper postivos de quienes hemos tenido el placer de hospedarnos en la Dar Rabha. Un sitio muy bonito, limpio y cuidado, ubicado en una zona perfecta de la medina, en la parte más tranquila y de buen rollo, lejos de los callejeros molestos del zoco. Karim y Said han sido muy amables y disponibles en todo momento. Nos hemos reído mucho en los momentos que hemos pasado junt@s. El ambiente es muy acogedor y cercano, como estar en casa entre amig@s. Recomiendo totalmente el sitio. La terraza un puntazo.

EN: I share all the positive comments of whom, like us, had the pleasure to stay at Dar Rabha. A very nice, cleaned and well-kept place, perfectly located in a mellow  and easygoingsh area of the Medina, far away from the annoying street people in the souk market.
Karim and Said have been kind and available at any time. We had very nice and funny moments together. The atmosphere is cosy and it is like staying home with good vibes friends.
I really recommend the place. Beautiful terrasse."
"I stayed this riad for 2 nights as part of our tour. The location is 5 mints from the blue gate, and convenient for Medina walk. It comes with breakfast, and we also had dinner at riad. One of the best tagine in Morocco. The staff, Karim, was so friendly and welcoming.  One night, he joined us and had a great conversation and laugh. This was one of our rare and important occation to talk and know about Morocco and Muslim culture I really appreciated. The room is clean and comes with cute bathroom. Rooftop had a great view of Medina. I would love to stay in this media again  when I have a chance to visit Fez again. I really recommend this riad."
"For the price this stay is amazing. The breakfast is some of the best we’ve had in morocco so far and everyone is so kind and willing to help. It’s in a great location for food, with ‘Made in M’ and ‘cinema cafe’ being my recommendations for close good food. If you want a drink, British saloon is near and serves alcohol (bit pricy though). Would recommend!"
"The hotel is located in Fes Bali, old Medina of Fes, giving it a special atmosphere. While hidden in a maze of small streets, it is not far from the Blue gate, where there are shops to buy food and taxis to catch. Owner and her son are very kind and helpful. There is a terrace at the roof of the hotel, offering incredible views over the old town of Fes. Breakfast was included, plentiful and included juice, tea, bread, pastry, eggs, fruit, cheese etc.  It should be noted, especially for rooms located lower, that in this Dar kind of accommodation, rooms have smaller windows and oriented to the inner patio/courtyard, not outside, meaning it is more difficult to ventilate the rooms, sometimes a slight smell lingers. (This applies to the family 4bed room at the base floor). The superior 3bed room, on the other hand, is at 3rd floor, no elevator, narrow stairs. But then, you have big windows, can ventilate, and its just a short walk to the upper terrace."
"Riad Fes is a lovely place, just 5 mins walk to the Blue Gate and right next to a great spot to get a taxi! Great location! Abdul the staff there was very helpful and friendly. 

The room was cosy and clean. Wifi was good. There is nothing else I would complain about this Riad except for the breakfast -  they do not serve coffee, only Mint tea and  continental breakfast. That's ok because right outside the Riad, there is a cafe called Batha Coffee house, which serves a very good hearty breakfast and fantastic coffee!

I would definitely stay here again but skip the breakfast!"
"If you have some doubts about the city, here is the best place to spend the night. I arrived in Medina Fes at mid night, streets were empty and scary for me. However, hostel is just 1 minute walking away from the place where taxi drop you off. It is so nice to have a place close the the main square. Staff was so helpful, I am sorry I forgot his name but he speaks many languages :) There was a free breakfast which was a typical breakfast you will see everywhere in Morocco. There were too many young tourists all around the world in this Hostel. Since I was traveling solo, I have had many friends in the venue. "
"Everyone that works at the Dar Rabha treats you like a guest but also like family. They’re very kind and will help you book excursions or find your way if there’s something you’re looking for. There’s a nice relaxing terrace, delicious breakfast and comfy air conditioned rooms. It is conveniently located just a short 5 min walk from the blue gate, local shopping including food, jewelry, art, and souvenirs. It’s very conveniently located and the staff couldn’t be friendlier 10/10 will stay again and will definitely recommend! "
"I stayed in this dar for 4 nights in april 2019. The location is excellent and comfortable, it's near the blue gate, juet outside the medina. Abdul and his mother are really accomodating and helpful, always ready to give you advices for your holiday. The cleaning conditions are good too. "
"stayed here for 2 nights ,every things was top , The staff are excellent helped us with everything we needed , rooms are very clean and well mantained.

We had guided tour from the riad which was very great too.
Will be back ::!!!"
"Me and my friends stayed here for a few days whilst travelling and this hostel is a beautiful traditional mocorran building. The staff here are very welcoming and the free breakfast is great! They put on trips to various places including a desert trip for 2-5 days! Also trips to chefchaouen. We didn’t have time to do any of these but they sound great! The rooms were clean and well looked after. We were in a room just near the one communal rooms and some of the family that work there sat outside sometimes but this wasn’t a problem as they were all lovely!"
"I stayed here for a weekend as a woman traveling solo. Very clean and beautiful road for someone looking for simple hostel. The location feels safe, staffed all hours, and is a short walk to sites in the old city. The staff will arrange taxi and guided tours at very good prices. Just let them know what you want to do when you arrive, or in advance. Good breakfast provided at the time you request. Breakfast included coffee, tea, crepes, pastry, yogurt, cheese. I really recommend this hostel for budget travelers. Small lockers provided for your valuables. Terrace with nice view of the city. Shared rooms and bathrooms. Excellent service."
"I stayed in this hostel for two nights. the place is very quiet and clean except for a bathroom that gave off bad smells from its pipes. the staff is kind and the same is located in a very convenient location 5 minutes walk from the main bus station."
"The best hostel I’ve had in all Morocco 

100%  recommended place . The staff very professional and respectfully I will come back again. If you’re there try to visit the terrace is more courageous place and relaxed"
"Good hostel with very friendly and helpful people. The breakfast is great and the price is good. The only points are that there are only a few toilets, showers and power plugs. There could be also more chairs on the rooftop. "
"My friend and I had an amazing stay at this riat hostel - the double rooms are nice and neat in a moroccan style, the location is close to the blue gate where you can find all kinds of restaurants and shops and the breakfast is delicious, authentic and more than enough. The absolute hightlight was the warm hearted and very friendly staff who took really good care of us and made us feel like home."
"Stayed here for only one night. It is a beautiful riad and with good wifi in lobby and room. I stayed in a 6 bed dorm, had basic facilities, bathroom wasnt too well maintained but its alright to me. The owner and staffs were really friendly and helpful to recommend restaurants and places to visit. The owner helped me with my booking of bus to chefchaouen. Breakfast was amazing! What a spread...Had a really filling breakfast and it taste yummy! All in all, it is value for money. I heard they have another branch in marrakech. Would like to visit again in future! Cheers"
"An amazing place in the old medina. One of old riads perfectly renewed. Rooms are tidy with private bathrooms. Place has two chill common rooms and a shared kitchen. On the top there's a nice terrace with great views. 

Staff was super friendly, waited for our groop around the hostel, and gave us a free breakfast 2 times! 

Altough they will try to scam you on the airport shuttle by saying it only takes 4 people - it takes 6 and should cost no more than 150 MAD."
"We had a really good stay here. The staff are very friendly and really helpful. I would recommend staying here while in Fez. The rooms are comfortable and price-wise they are really competitive. It is close to the median, too, so that is a bonus."
"The guys who work there are so friendly, and welcoming, for every tip you want to ask they are available to answer you. My only doubt was about one trip organized very last minutes, I think it was not worth the price I payed, but its part of the system, so I understand. I would have wanted this in advance, because I cant find money on the ground. For the rest, a very nice and relaxing experience, everyone was chillout, in a very typical familiar corner of the biggest medina in the world."
"Clean and very pleasant rooms most of the time. Maybe small things need to be fixed in the room. Tasty breakfast, very nice staff, which helped us in every situation and organized very cool daytrips around Fez. All in all worth the money, we would come back anytime!"
"We spent 9 days in Fes at Dar Rabha and could not have been happier! Upon arrival Sayid was super helpful and had us checked in very quickly. Our room was spacious and the beds were fresh and clean. The showers were AMAZING, always had hot water and lots of room! All of the staff were wonderfully helpful, friendly and obliging, the ladies who helped with breakfast did not mind allowing us to bring our breakfast (which is also delicious) to the terrace to enjoy the sights of Fes from afar. All three of us would happily go back to Dar Rabha anytime, and we especially enjoyed the adorable kittens within the hostel! Wonderful place!"
"After our flight was delayed and we arrived two hours after our expected time, the staff at Dar Rabha was extremely accommodating and welcoming, even at 12 am! We were welcomed into a lovely room with a large bathroom and nice features. In the morning when we were finally able to see the hostel in true light, our expectations were exceeded in every way. The rooms are beautiful and the breakfast was delicious, true to Moroccan fashion. We then went on a tour that was arranged by the hostel, and afterwards, were walked to a restaurant by one of the employees. During one of the nights we went to the Sahara Desert, and when we returned, the employees had moved us into a private room because he thought that we might like a quiet, comfortable room after our long day of traveling. Everything about our stay at Dar Rabha was exceeded and I could not recommend this lovely place anymore! Definitely worth a trip to Morocco!!"
"Amazing hostel in a great location. Hostel is very clean and nearby Blue gate in medina. Hostel owner and staff were very friendly and assisted with bookings for excursions and any other request/info. Highly recommend this hostel and top hostel care-taker- Nourdin is a gem of a guy"
"If you are looking for a nice hostel with good location and price, this is the place! I stayed in a shared dorm room, the bed was comfy and the shower was okay. Just be aware that there is one bathroom for a room of 8 people, but for the price it was okay with me. The breakfast was good and included and there are many restaurants nearby as well as a bus station within walking distance if you plan to catch a bus to Chefchaouen. The common room and the rooftop are nice areas to hangout. "
"The Riad was an amazing experience and hellla fuun. It definitely has the feel of a cute Moroccan riad, with its traditional tiles, to its funky decoration (and not to mention the mint tea that is served to everyone, amazing). I stayed there with 4 of my friends, and the staff there were so lovely and welcoming, from the night we arrived to the day we left. The rooftop was the best part, as it is within the Medina, so you can see the landscapes and Masjids. And the Adhan (call to prayer) sounds so beautiful from the top, as there are many Masjids located around the Medina. To just sit there and enjoy the sound, that is definitely one of the aspects I miss. Also, meeting other people from around the world, that was definitely a bonus too. To this date, we still go back, seeing as it became our first home."
"Brilliant people, always willing to help, beautiful rooftop terrace chill out spot. Near good places. Nice location near taxi rank too. This place feels like a home and I enjoy frequent, welcomed visits back ☺"
"This place was a great experience since the very first moment. From the airport pick up, to the beautiful room, going through their delicious mint tea, yummy breakfast and 24/7 extreme friendliness, this place and it's people got my heart. They helped us with everything they could and even more. The manager is a great person, very honest, humble and kind. Thanks for you hospitality! It was a great way to start out trip in Morocco :) hope to see you again! Lots of love from Argentina! "
"THE ULTIMATE HOSTEL
BEST location (EASIEST to find from the Gate of the post office)
Best price (just 50 dirhams)
Best bathroom (clean, with toilets paper, hand wash gel, hot water...)
Best breakfast
Comfortable beds. Friendly staff. No curfew. wifi. Towels. Just all you need, where you need it for a little price.

Fez has 9.600 streets. Its so easy to get lost specially at night time can be scary with all this people coming to you offering ""help"" (the ask for money later and never its enough) SO ITS IMPORTANT TO GET A HOSTEL YOU CAN FIND FOR YOURSELF.

Im Morocco (Fez, Chefchaouen, Tagier) I've been in many hostels and DAR RABHA this is THE BEST QUALITY-PRICE HOSTEL I've known.

Without any doubt next time Im visiting Fez Im going there. I recommend you all to book there. You won't regret at all."
"The location was perfect. The people were sooo lovely and kind and they really helped us maneuver our way around. The hostel was very clean and the rooftop is soooo pretty! really enjoyed my stay there"
"I  stayed in Dar Rabha with my friends for a week and not only I found a place where we were welcomed warmly but also a convenient place in terms of location and service. I still miss the breakfast which I loved a lot and the views from the rooftop terrace which were amazing .Would recommend to anybody!  :)"
"The location is great and the manager has been so helpful. He arranged a guide for our tour of the Medina. A guide is so worth the price as I'd never find anything on my own, nor find my way out again. 
He's also helping us with further travels and ideas we hadn't thought of. 
Our room is very nice and in our short experience in Morocco, both the bedroom and bathroom are nice. There seems to be a combination of private rooms and hostel type rooms. Great for single travellers. And the cost is decent. 
It's nice to relax on the terrace in the evening. "
"We had a really pleasant stay at Dar Rabha. Said was more than helpful, taking us to the bus station to book tickets and then helping us secure a taxi when we were unable to get a space on the bus. The hostel is clean, well decorated and spacious. The beds are comfortable and the air con actually works (which is rare in Morocco!) Plus the central location just makes this the perfect hostel.

We would highly recommend staying at Dar Rabha and plan to stay here again when we return. :)"
"Amazing hostel, everywhere you look is beautiful, breakfast is very complete, it is situated very close from everything you need and the staff is incredible especially if Said stills work in this hostel. This guy has a heart made of gold."
"We loved this place, beautiful and unique. The staff are very friendly and so helpful. It is  1 min away from the medina. They also organized excursions and desert tours. We met other wonderful travelers."
"The true test of customer service is how the staff handle things when they go wrong.  After checking into Dar Rabha, booking a tour for the next day, and heading out for dinner, we returned to our room to find the air conditioner broken and the bathroom full of water from a burst water heater.  Within 15 minutes, the manager Said had us checked into a new (and even nicer!) property for the same price.  He walked us over there in the midst of the ongoing chaos, made sure that our tour guide found our new accommodations the next day, and even hand-delivered a pair of sunglasses that my friend left in her room. Kudos to Dar Rabha on turning a disaster into a fond memory!"
"I have been for 2 nights and it is just incredible. Said, the manager was very polite and he showed many places and things to do. I have met other customers and they were very nice as well. The hostel has free tee and a huge terrace where you can smoke shicha. "
"Great location inside the medina. Syed met us from our taxi. Then went through the best things to see in fez and showed us the map of the medina too. Organised a great walking tour for us, showed us to a nice restaurant and organised our airport transfer too! Made our stay very hassle free. Room was a family room so our group could stay together which was nice but it was a little small. Breakfast was included."
"Free bike to cycle around in Fez and surroundings. Nice ambiance to socialize with other travelers. Pleasant hot shower and use of kitchen. Friendly staff. 6 bunk beds in a rather small dorm. Good location if you want to explore the medina, but not if you want to travel by air or train to onward destinations."
"I had a great two night stay at Dar Rabha. Aziz and Syed were incredibly helpful and insightful with booking a tour of the city, arranging travel, and giving advice about where to eat and what to do while in Fez. Hostel is a beautifully decorated Moroccan style building inside of the Medina but close enough to the outskirts that you will not get lost easily. I would 100% recommend this hostel for anyone looking for a warm and welcoming environment with a great staff."
"This hostel was nearly perfect! I was warmly welcomed by Said and his team. Me, as a female solo traveller, was very grateful to have these guys helping me find my way. They went with me to the bus station so I could buy my tickets to Chefchaouen. They showed me the way to their favourite restaurants at the Medina, etc. And even though sometimes they looked so tired they were always smiling and willing to help. I'm really greateful for all the help. The atmos is really cool and I met a lot of interesting people there! I had a fantastic time at Dar Rabah and totally recommend it!"
"Fes was the first location I and my girlfriend arrived into within Morocco in December, and although slightly hard to find, we were welcomed with open arms with some hot mint tea. They made us feel very at home. We were late for breakfast in the morning but they went out of their way to make sure we were fed. When we needed a bus to Chefchaouen, one of the workers went to the bus stop for us to buy our tickets. In the morning he even walked us to the bus stop at 6am!! I tried to give him money but he wouldnt accept it, genuine people there. Therefore if i couldnt give him money I decided the best I could do was rate my experience as 5/5 on trip advisor."
"To the fez Medina is only 44 seconds walk, is excellent.
Out of the hostel, left, right, straight down, and your onto the main streets of the Fez Medina.
The manager made us feel welcome.
Breakfast was really good, some good travellers there.
Only complaint would be about room 5 - the bathroom. The bathroom was inside the toilet and if you needed the toilet after somebody had a shower everything was soaking wet. Also the wash Bason was about to fall over.

Thanks to the manager who meet us in Chefchaouen.  I'm sure he will remember me and the 200dhm I lost."
"It was the most exciting holiday we've ever had while staying at dar rabha thanks to the young staff that runs the guesthouse. Said,the manager, was of great help. He did all his best to make us feel at home. We have nothing to complain about. Everything was clean. The tariff was the lowest . The guesthouse is in the heart of the old medina. I do really recommend the place to anyone who would like to spend a good holiday with an adorable staff.
NB. If SAID, the manager, advises or warns you, do listen to his advice. He is an experienced young man. "
"This hostel is located at the top of the medina which means that you are both close to all the action but it's still easy to get to on the first day before you know your way around and you don't have to schlep your bags through the chaos. 

The staff was very friendly and made us feel welcome at all times. They were super knowledgeable, helpful, and eager to share information. "
"­- The location is amazing! You are so close to the Medina. There is also a nearby road which isa hub for taxis. It only costs 10Dhs to go wherever you want in the old city, so it was our mainmode of transport throughout the holiday. This was very useful.

­- The hostel is beautiful. Not just the decor, but also the terrace. There is a shaded section withseating and tables, which is great for relaxing after a tiring day of exploration. The hostel isreally sociable too, so that was a great area to chat with people from around the globe. The viewat the top is also incredible. You can see the sprawling rooftops of the Medina as well as themountainous landscape beyond Fes.

­- The staff were what made the holiday so excellent. They helped organise tours and trips for us(the desert trip that you can get from them is wonderful!). They were extremely friendly (evenwhen we came back in the early hours). All the staff seemed to work enthusiastically to ensure that younever have any problems. By the time that our week there had ended they felt more like friendsthan staff.
The cats they have are really cute.

­- I couldn't believe how low the price was. Such great value for money for such quality service.
Free breakfast too!"
"Couldn't fault this hostel if I tried. 
The guys who run it make it feel like your own home and will do anything to help you out whether that's arranging trips, pointing you to cool places, or even just being someone to chill out with. The free breakfast every morning is massive and is a nice time to chat with the other people staying there (who were all very friendly and interesting sorts). Location is great too - you're a turn away from taxis/the medina/Bab Bouljoud.
Our rooms had keys and so there was no fear about leaving our stuff in there.
Aziz took us on a tour of the desert, Marrakech, and everywhere in between - made it really fun and saw lots of interesting places and people.
Said (one of the guys who runs the hostel) is so chilled out and friendly - always enjoyed talking with him.
Perfect hostel."
"I stayed in Dar Rabha for two nights, it is a fantastic hostel, location is great and the rooms are very nice and clean! The hosts are very helpful and happy to give advice on the city, overall the hostel has a very cool atmosphere :)"
"The location is good (entrance of Medina) and the service is super good too. The guys were nice with us and we have a guided tour around the city. 
The room and the toilet are simple and please don't create great expectations about it. It's good enough to sleep. It is consistent with the price. Good cost benefit."
"I stayed in this hostel for a week while I was in Fez. The staff was very helpful and friendly, they even offered me to take me on a day trip to another city because I was in Fez for so long. The rooms and the bathroom were clean, the wifi was good, the breakfast was good and the roof terrace/tent was a great place to chill out."
"I stayed at Dar Rabha for 2 nights and I have to say it was the best hostel among all that I have stayed in Morocco. 
First, it is super close to the Blue Gate. You wouldn't find a better location than Dar Rabha, especially if you don't want to get lost in the Medine after a whole day tiring journey. 
Second, the Staffs were very friendly and helpful. It was the warmest stay throughout my trip in Morocco. They allowed me to store my big backpack there for 2 days and offered me tea after I returned to Fes waiting for the 1am night train to Casablanca (even I am not staying there anymore). 
The atmosphere was also very chill that I have had a great time with the hosts and other backpackers there.
Above all, dorm was fine, toilet was clean and the price is reasonable. Nothing that I can complain.
I highly recommend Dar Rabha if you are travelling in Fes."
"The hostel is located just few minutes far from the Blue Gate, the main entrance of the medina. The owner is nice and he provides all the info you need. Really cozy and friendly place, I would suggest it."
"Very clean, very nice decoration, owner and workers are just so nice and helpful, they will guarantee you have the best stay in Dar Rabha! The location is very good, right at the entrance of the medina so you don't have to walk a lot in the narrow streets to reach it. Totally recommend. Thank you Said for everything!"
"The highlight of this hostel has to be the hosts. At least one is always available inside the hostel to give you advice, answer your questions about any leg of your trip through Morocco and help you find activities such as desert trips, hamam visits and cooking classes. The hostel is in a great location by the Blue Gate, the two main shopping streets and plenty of restaurants for cheap eats. I would definitely recommend this hostel to any traveler."
"We were very happy with our 3 nights here. Good value for money, friendly staff and convenient location. The beds are comfy and clean towels are provided. Said was very helpful in recommending us places to go and things to see."
"Great manager. Hot shower. Reliable wifi. Convenient location. Breakfast served like that of a hotel. Reasonably priced laundry service.  Manager Said will go out of his way to make your stay enjoyable.  Rooms are clean and relatively spacious compared to other dorms in Morocco.  If youre not a fan of the tours offered, you can still hide away from the busy streets of the medina in the rooftop terrace with shisha and mint tea.  Great atmosphere with like-minded travelers.  Generally a great spot to take day trips to Chefchaouen or take the Sahara tours."
"Kittens are not a reason to choose a hotel. But as of the end of February 2016, 5 of them are at Dar Rabha.

The hotel is great, nice indoor courtyard, ensuite bathroom for each room (it was busy so our booking was moved from the 8-person dorm to 4-person dorm), with good hot water. Rooftop patio with view, and faux-Berber tent with sofas, tables, and a hookah you can use. 

Steady stream of young tourists passing through while we were there. Sayeed who runs the place is pleasant, polite, and easy-going. We didn't want to buy tours, and he didn't push them. The breakfast was filling, with the standard bread, butter, jam, and tea/coffee complimented by yoghurt, orange juice, cornbread, and crepe pastry.

WiFi is fast and far-reaching. Note that there were 2 electrical sockets (plus 1 in bathroom) in our 4-bed dorm.

It's walkable from the bus station, but hard to do without getting lost. Go right out of the station, and left into the medina. Go through the used clothes and vegetables. Turn right after the first cafe, then a very quick left and a very quick right and a quick left again. You want to follow the line of restaurants, who will harass you to come inside. If you miss a turn, you'll start walking past a lot of butchers and then down hill: turn around and follow the signs for Bab Boujloud, then when you get to it (a big blue portal out of the medina), turn around again and straddle the restaurants to your right. When you're clear of them, go maybe 20m, then down the stairs to your left. If you come out into an area with cars, you just missed the steps. 

"
"Staff:
I stayed here for two nights and had an exceptional experience. The manager, Said, is very helpful and friendly. He can plan trips and guides for you if you wish or if you'd rather explore on your own (which I did) he always gives good advice on where to go and what to do. He even went to far as to give us bread and cheese when me and my friend came back hungry late at night when other things places had closed. 

Accommodation:
The free breakfast is very good and substantial.  Even got to try a traditional Moroccan breakfast that a woman who worked there made for herself. It was delicious and very nice to sit and talk with the staff. The terrace is big and very nice as well. Beds are comfortable and there is a heater and AC in the rooms. 

Location:
The location is good too. It is close to the main shops in the medina but also close to the streets outside of the medina. The post office is very close and is a good landmark to tell a taxi. 

This place made fes my favorite city in Morocco. Truly exceptional! 

I have posted photos of the view from the terrace and the breakfast. "
"If you visit Fes (and you should!!), you have to stay at this place. The place is gorgeous; it's nicely decorated, clean, and comfy. The owner is a very friendly and funny guy. The staff are very nice and helpful. I quickly became friends with them, they are genuinely kind and generous (Said, Noureldin, and Hind). You will start your day with nice Moroccan style breakfast (yummmmmmy!), and they offer city tours and also trips to Chefchouen. 

I will definitely go back and visit!"
"The rooms are nicely decorated and the private bathroom was clean and in Moroccan style. The owner was very friendly, helpful and welcomed us with the usual Moroccan tea. Furthermore, the breakfast was good and the hostel was quiet."
"If you are in Fes, you have to sleep there. Amazing decoration, the best manager, comfy beds, close to all attractions, delicious breakfast. Real Moroccan style! I would also recommend to take the guided tour which they offer (national guide)."
"Hey everyone, the reason why o say stay here is because of the management. The guy who owns the hostel is a real standup genuinely kind guy. He really looks out for you and wants you to have a good stay, was extremely accommodating and spoke amazing English. Great value and felt most comfortable here of all the hostels in Morocco, because of the management. Thanks again!"
"Amazing place to stay, it's a beautiful place, the people who work there all are really friendly and helpful, the free Moroccan breakfast is huge and delicious, and the shower is perfect :) it's close by the blue gate right in the old medina, and really easy to reach :) "
"I've been in 4 cities in Morroco and this hostel was the best. Location is excellent, near hotspots of Fez. The bedrooms are very good, the beds are very comfortable and the bathroom are very clean. The main room (lobby) are beautiful and with the traditional decorations. Said (the manager) is very kind, helpful and you can ask him anything you need to now (places, the price to negotiate with the sellers in the street, how to get where you want). He treated us like family, always with a good tea! I strongly recommend this hostel."
"How can I start.. 
Firstly Said (the manager of the hostel) and all the other workers are very welcoming. They are very kind and always willing to help with your every need.. It's a very beautiful hostel and perfectly located near the famous blue gate so you won't have any problems getting around!

"The location is awesome, inside of the medina, close to really good places to eat street food. I spent a week at the hostel, everything is clean and comfy, also the staff was so nice and helpful. For sure I had such a great time and I definitely recommend this hostel. 
Breakfast is included and its great!"
"I can recommend this hostel in Fes, if you did not decide yet. With every services, you will be satisfied when you leave. Said Gharib is the manager of hostel and he is reliable. You can stay this hostel with confidence."
"It stays in a great area, near by the interesting thing to see, the hostel itself it's awesome, with a very nice hoof top where u can relax ! And the staff it is just amazing making u fell like u are home, and always willing to help with anything! Hope to be back soon "
"Dar Rabha was the perfect place to stay in Fés situated close to a square where the taxi drops you and right inside the best preserved old town in the arabian world , just a 3 minute walk from the blue gate , the cities monument i spend a wonderful time there same as all other people i met there. The hostel guys were friendyl and were a great example of moroccan hospitality. One guy from the hostel, Said, showed me around the town (for free) and i felt at home and accepted in the city and even meet some locals with him. They guys know the best restaurant and things to do in the city and the tea they serve for is refreshing and tasty. The also offer all kinds of tour for good prices and the rooftop terasse is stunning and relaxing. The interor is neatly designed and makes you feel like a sultan in 1001 night with old style arabian artwork of wood and stone and antique arabian rifles on the wall. Have just been to that one in Fés , but it was the best during my trip in Morocco and its surely one of the best in the city! Nice to meet people but never noisy or too loud"
"This is a lovely little place with friendly and incredibly helpful staff. It is conveniently located at the edge of medina, easy to find. With a medina rush on its doorstep the hostel, especially the roof terrace, yet offers relaxed atmosphere. Somewhat more expensive than other hostels we stayed at in Morocco, but we don't regret. Would recommend the place."
"We stayed in the ensuite double bedroom for 2 nights in Dar Rabha Hostel. We were supposed to stay at Zohour Hostel but it was overbooked (I think). Nevertheless, it was not a problem for us, we enjoyed our stay at Dar Rabha very much! Saeed (the manager) is a super nice person. Thank you so much for the warm hospitality! :)"
"We enjoyed our time at Dar Rabha, this riad was right in the centre of the medina and was really great value for money. Our stay included a traditional riad with a roof top terrace where we were able to avail of their sheesha at night. the The staff was very friendly and offered us unlimited mint tea throughout the day. Our breakfast was also included with our stay and was quite good. The dorm rooms had enough space for all your stuff and included an en suite bathroom. The private rooms were much more spacious and included a bigger en suite bathroom but didn't cost that much more than the dorm rooms. 

We would discourage taking the tour guide to walk around the city as the medina was quite easy to navigate through .. we were able to walk around and easily find our way through the streets (esp after a day or two). 

We did avail of the riad's recommendation for a local hammam and massage. The local hammam cost us 100 dhs per person for a hammam and massage, and was supposed to include the entrance, the essentials you would need for the hammam (black soap, scrubber, etc) and the tips for the attendant (for 30dhs) and a 30 min massage (for 70dhs). We wouldn't recommend going for this one... esp not the massage that only last 3-6 mins vs what was supposed to be 30 mins. The hammam bath that was recommended was also about a 15 min walk outside the medina and didn't really have any mosaic architecture or anything. The hammam provided some good insight into the local culture including what was supposed to be done, when and how... but we would recommend trying out the local hammams which are inside the medina right outside the riad on the main street.

In closing, the actual riad was fantastic however I would steer away from booking the hammam through them."
"I stayed with a friend at Dar Rabha for 2 nights. It was like a vacation from other hostels we have stayed at in Morocco. Hot showers, comfortable and warm beds, good breakfast, and very friendly staff! Saheed (spelling?) was super nice and walked us all the way to the bus station to buy tickets at night. It's very close to one of the main streets as well so a good location. We loved this place!"
"I stayed two separate nights, both was perfect. The first time I had a 4bed shared room and it ended up being me and my one other friend only so we had a private shower!! The bed were even big ones, weren't the bunk beds. 

The second time I was alone so I was in the 6 bed bunk room. 

Both time the rooms were clean and hot water is there. breakfast is served in the lounge and you get to chat with other travelers. 

The manager Siad is absolutely the best. He speaks good English, very willing to help and make sure your stay is good. He walked me to the bus station and helped me got tickets to another city because I didn't know how. Thank you so much!! 

This place is extremely affordable, especially if you get shared rooms.

Also the location is central and very easy to get to from the main Blue Gate. Under 3 minutes walk.

"
"Having only two nights in Fez, the location and staff really helped us make the most of our time

The location is great, easy to find, which in the medina is no mean feat
The recommendations of the staff were spot on, from sights, to shops, to great food!  They're also happy to help whatever you n,eed
Rooms are really comfy, atmosphere is beautiful and the brekky and terrace are tops

Would definitely recommend"
"I live in the Fes region and Dar Rabha is my go-to place when I want to spend a night in the Fes medina. The location is great and it is very affordable, but the staff members are the best part of the experience. Aziz (the owner) is a very hospitable and honest man, and I consider him a good friend.  He loves to offer you tea and make sure you know what's happening in the medina during your stay, and he has even taken me to a few local events I would have never discovered otherwise.  The rest of the staff are very friendly and great people as well, and I highly recommend staying here. Rooms are clean and comfortable and the roof is a great place to hang out."
"Beautiful interior, amazing atmosphere, perfect location (in the center of Medina) and a professional crew. In spite of being a new manager, Said does a really good job. With his friends they are very friendly and helpful, know the whole city and almost every dweller. Furthermore, they prepare excellent tea (I don’t remember how many times I asked them for it). Rooms are very comfortable and clean. A trip to the Middle Atlas Mountains organized by the hostel was very interesting and well prepared. Very good breakfast was included. A rooftop area is perfect for relax, especially at night. Strongly recommend this hostel!"
"Sayid and his team could not have provided a nicer stay. Great location and extremely friendly and helpful staff. Noise travels a little throughout the hostel but not a major issue. Good breakfast included with a good rooftop area. Thank you sayid for a great few days. "
"My friend and I showed up at the hostel just outside the Blue Gate of the Medina of Fes with basically nothing planned for our entire trip. The hostel manager Said took care of us the whole time suggesting interesting things to see, eat, and do. As well, we booked a number of tours and day trips through him with no fuss and had a great time with each one. I would highly recommend a trip to the local Hamam, a very special experience indeed. 

Also, unlimited mint and a beautiful view of the medina in the mornings!"
"Dar Rabha is a really wonderful, vibrant hostel. The service is very attentive and friendly - Said, the manager, and his little team were always looking to ensure that everyone had a perfect experience in Fes. The hostel itself is lovely and typically, brightly Moroccan, with a roof terrace and a bottom lounge for all the guests to mingle. The beds are comfortable and they have the best breakfast I've had at a hostel! They are also situated almost on the Medina and they offer great tours from the hostel. All in all I cannot gush too much about this hostel, it was an excellent experience."
"Friendly and helpful staff, beautiful and clean mini-riad, quiet but close to everything. Couldn't be better. Great value for little money. However, if privacy is what you need most, choose the room upstairs. The rooms on the ground-floor have doors opening to a common space where you can meet other people."
"My wife and I had a great time here. The staff are really friendly and accommodating. The room was comfortable and clean. Traditional breakfasts were served, a mix of pancakes, olives, cheeses, jams etc. - enough to keep you going for while. 
The old Medina is definitely an experience not to be missed, with it's rich culture and monuments. We would definitely come back and stay at Dar Rabha. Thanks to all the staff for our memorable experience."
"Arriving to Fes with little idea of what to see or do the guys here really took me under their wing. They are very proud of their beautiful city and go out of the way to make sure you leave with great memories."
"Hostel is located in the very centre of city. Our room was small but cosy and clean. The staff was very helpful and hearty. Thanks to Dar Rabha we had a chance to experience the real hammam :)
Me and my firends felt at home."
"I went with three friends here and we had a great time in Fes. The atmosphere was cozy, the breakfast really good. Aziz recommended us a place to eat and was not disappointed. In the evenings we would gather on the roof and talk to other guests, everyone was friendly, chill and happy. 
Then Aziz suggested us to take a trip to the desert organized by someone he knew and we changed our plans: instead of going straight to Marakkesh we went to the desert and oh, we had the best time there. I do hope I'll visit Morocco again and when that happens, I'll stay at Dar Rabha again."
"We Stayed in this charming Riad with our two little daughters for two nights. The host was really nice and very helpful. Whenever we needed something he was there to help. The kitchen staff was very nice as well. When we arrived we were very exhausted and didn't wake on time for our breakfast, but the lady in the kitchen was more than happy to serve us a late breakfast. We had to stay an extra night a find no problems with that. The host is very knowledgeable  and answered every question we asked him about the city and how to get around.  The place itself is charming and quiet to have a peaceful sleep. Traditional Moroccan architecture is all over the place from decorations to art pieces. We liked the location as it's close to the heart of the old city of Fes. Walking distance to ""Old Medina"" where you can witness how hand made Moroccan goodies are made. How about food? It's so delicious with its moroccan flavor. Anyway I really recommend this Riad and for sure I'll go back whenever I can."
"i really had a bless to stay at this spot ,let start with the location which was really in the center of everything , also the front disk receptionist was VERY helpful .i stayed for 2 nights at this Riyad with 2 other friends and we really liked it and for sure  i ll pay a visit to this Riyad next time i come across this beautiful town Fes .We supposed to check out at 12pm but we wanted to do the last minute shopping so we were wondering where we gonna keep our suitcases  at least till we would get done with the shopping so i asked the receptionist and he was very helpful by letting us use their  dormitory locker; we left our belongings at the dormitory locker  for almost half a day without a charge ,plus we enjoying couple of mint tea when we got back from the long walk around the narrow streets of the Old Medina ."
"Little place downtown in the medina of Fez, offer economic rates for bed and breakfast. It is perfect as a base camp to get lost in the medina of Fez. The staff is friendly and correct. They have a terrace with views of the medina where you can converse with other travelers staying in the hostel. The rooms are a bit humid but are acceptably clean. Central but quiet. Good place for travelers who do not want to spend too much money and well situated. Wi-Fi in the hall, not in the rooms."
"When my 4 friends and I arrived it was during Ramadan however we were still greeted very friendly and were offered tea upon entering this beautiful, authentic hostel in the old part of the city. After a long day they set up a tour of Fez for us(do not recommend taking it, it is purely for sales) after that we got a home cooked meal with authentic and delicious Moroccan food. We also got delicious filling breakfast in the morning. Good AC, very friendly staff(treated me like a brother), good location, good accommodations for the price. Stayed 2 separate times for a night. You get what you pay for."
"If I am honest Dar Rabha is pretty typical of a Moroccan guest house, I stayed here for 4 nights with friends in 2014, it was clean and cool which in the depths of summer in Morocco is a blessing. 

The upstairs area that is outside is okay and nice to sit around in the evening, if a little challenging to get too.

Knowledge of the local areas by the hotel staff was really good, and instructions on how not to get lost in the town were greatly appreciated

They have a great relationship with tour guides and can arrange for tours around the town, and more importantly for us , in to the desert, which are reasonably priced and professional.

DOWNFALLS:
•my bunk squeaked with even the slightest of movement
• air conditioning water landed on me and my bed.
•initially quite challenging to find, there are no real signs that are noticeable.

UPSIDES:
•really friendly atmosphere in the hostel from the staff and their families and friends.
•great local knowledge
•cool - temperature wise
•decent breakfast
•conveniently located at the top of the hill
•cheap

"Dar Rabha was our second accommodation in Fes. It was cheaper, the toilets are good and the people working are really nice. They were very helpful and very welcoming. The price is fair and it's the place in Fes I would recommend! Some rooms have no privacy at all, thats the only problem!"
"It is a very cosy place with typical moroccan decor. 
Our room had some privacy issues since it was on the ground floor with the door and the window (made out of colored glass) facing the common space. 
The staff was nice but only a few of them spoke English. You should have no problem if you speak French though. 
The Dar offers a laundry service for 70 mad, which is good. 
It is in the Medina but the staff provided very clear directions on how to find it so we had no problems. The breakfast is quite good."
"We sadly only had one night at this magnificent establishment. However in our short time we did not want for anything.

Simply to list a few good things: our room was clean and very comfortable. The location was very convenient for accessing the medina. The provided breakfast was ample and delicious. Rooms are very reasonably priced. 

Special mention to the staff who were excellent. They were always friendly and very helpful. 

I will be staying here next time I am in Fes. "
"Dar Rabha is a really beautiful and classic riad in an excellent location, within seconds of the Blue Gate in the medina and the central taxi meeting spot the Batha Post Office. Although it markets itself as a hostel, it felt more like the classic Moroccan riads I had read so much about, with a lovely, friendly family as hosts and beautiful decorations and features. All the staff are helpful and friendly and if you have any questions (like where the closest place to eat, change money or get a taxi is) they will not only tell you, but take you straight there. 
The only thing I would suggest as improvements is maybe getting some sturdier bunk beds. If you're on the top bunk whenever you turn over the bed rocks a lot and must be a little annoying for the person on the bottom bunk.
Very filling breakfast but it would be great if it would start a little eralier, even just 30 minutes or so earlier. 
Shukran Aziz and Dar Rabha! I hope to stay here again one day!"
"The best thing about this hostel is the position. Near Batha Square (or Batha Hotel, if you are talking to a taxist) and the blue door, you don't have to cross bad people in the medina when you are returning at night. 

Very good staff and breakfast. Only bad aspect: the bed sheets weren't exactly very clean, but it has not been a problem for us."
"Thank you for the great time in Fes! The hostel was great. It was near by the center and any delicious restaurant. It was very clean and the people there are totally friendly, hospitable and helpful! The brekfast in the  morning was big, very very deliciuos and variety. If you ask the hosts about the way, they are happy to show or explain you and all time they indulge you with tea! It was one of the best hostels that I have ever been!"
"We stayed here for two nights and had a wonderful time. The Hosts were unbelievable friendly and helpful. The breakfast was very good and healthy (and for free!) and we always got gratis mint-tea. The rooms were nice and clean, we had a bathroom for our own and aircondition!
The hosts helped us a lot with travelling questions (they booked a bus and a hostel in chefchaouen for us!). The friendly women took us girls to the Hamman; a wonderful experience!!
I always would return to this lovely place with its lovely people! Thank you for the unforgettable time!"
"Brilliant location in the medina, clean and air conditioned room and the best breakfast I've ever had in a hostel. Very nice, welcoming and helpful staff. Good price  - I definitely recommend this hostel if you're looking for a nice and cheap place to stay in Fés! "
"Rooms were bright and airy, fast wifi, and very cery comfortable. Everything is so nice... But the best is location and staff. They are friendly and help you to find everything you need. I loved this place. It is the best riad I've been so far."
"This place is seriously magical - it is the best riad experience we've had so far in Morocco! Perhaps the best thing about this hostel is the communal courtyard at the base - everyone  congregates around here and both staff and travellers are super friendly and just so chilled! We met some awesome people at this riad and ending up spending most breakfasts and dinners with them. It was so nice to meet likeminded, young, budget-concious + friendly travellers! We were also lucky enough to be there during ramadan, when they served 'breakfast' (dinner) for free every night! The free actual breakfast in the morning is great too - more than you can eat! Aside from the above, the rooms were airy + bright, the water hot, the wifi fast, the beds super comfortable and in a perfect location. You literally couldn't ask for anything more in fes! Highly recommended!!"
"Dar Rabha made Morocco feel like home. The staff were awesome! They catered to any need we had. Whether that be serving mint tea at any time throughout the day, or leading us wherever we wanted to visit. They took us to restaurants, set up a tour (with a guide named Hassan), led us to a Hamam, showed us where to get a shave; these guys were awesome! Four of us stayed in a five person room with one other guest. The room was air conditioned and definitely reflected the Moroccan style. Nice quiet place! They also served a nice small breakfast. Dar Rabha made our trip to Morocco awesome!"
"It seems that only the coolest, most easy-going people stay here. Every guest you will want as your new best friend. The guys who run this place are for realz the kindest, funniest, and most caring people you will meet in Fes. They help with anything you need.  It feels like you're staying with your family at their rad riad, without the family drama. It's located in a nice area that is easy to find and really close to most things you're gonna want to do, too. Oh, and it's clean and there's a big breakfast that's included too!"
"On arrival Marouane found out that I was learning Arabic. From that point onwards he refused to speak to me in English. He and the other staff were all wonderfully friendly and showed true Moroccan hospitality, the sort of which one would not find in other traveller/hostel establishments. This felt much more homely.

The breakfast was a feast, with one or two of the other guests packing away their leftovers for lunchtime snacks as there was just too much to finish in one sitting. The only problem is that breakfast is not served until 9am, so if you are peckish or want to get going before then you will either have to forfeit the free breakfast or return after a wander.

The comfort of the rooftop lounge/terrace is heavenly. Don't expect a great few of the surrounding area - the buildings in Fes are built virtually on top of each other! - but do expect to find some solitude and tranquility that is a necessity after a day of exploring Fes's streets. 

I personally would recommend other cities over Fes if you are on your own/want to explore on your own, as I found it was the city in which you are least able to ditch the 'Tourist' sticker branded on your forehead. I was annoyed not to have spent more time in Rabat and Meknes as when I was there (even if it was for less than a day in both places) I found the locals were not so much eyeing up your wallet, as being just truly and genuinely friendly. Nevertheless if you are passing by do stop in briefly to experience an attack on the senses that only the ancient Medina of Fes can really give!

(Oh and beware of the faux-guides and ending up getting to the end of the day and realising that what you thought was just friendliness was actually an attempt to get money of you. I had a bad experience of being led to a number of shops, feeling very pressured into buying gifts for my family but also my 'guide'. Whilst he was off getting mint tea for me the shop owner said how poor my guide's family was and how I should probably get them a gift, only for the gift to be rejected at the end of the day and for me being led down a dark street and told I needed to give him money instead. As I said, if you are on your own, be warned!)"
"Dar Rabha beautifully restored in the old Moroccan tradition.    The location was great with it being on the edge of the Medina.  It is very easy to find.  The staff, especially Chorouk, were helpful in booking tours and helping you to find items in the medina.  Aziz, the owner, is very much into healthy food and told us excellent places to eat.  He also shared his insights and culture with us.

On the rooftop is a beautifully decorated sitting room.  The breakfast was plentiful.  Of course, you could drink that wonderful mint tea any time of the day.   On the last day, even though we left early, they made us a sack breakfast to take with us.   My only complaint is they served the breakfast usually after 9:00 in the morning.

Overall, this is an excellent value and choice to stay in Fes.  We highly recommend it."
"Since travelling as a solo woman in Morocco can be a very stimulating experience, it was great to had found a lovely place such as Dar Rahba to stay at. It felt like home.The staff was very nice and polite, always helpful and offered tea many time thoughout the day if you were staying in (it was raining a lot when I visited). I even got to share a meal with the family and staff from a communual dish one evening!
The breakfast included in the price was delicious, the rooftop terrace cozy with a real moroccan living room. The place was quiet and clean and it actually had hot showers with good water pressure, a rarity in Morocco!
Very good value (I stayed in the 6 bed dorm). Would highly recommend it!"
"No doubt we would recommend Dar Rabha to anyone. 1. Location was great. Really easy to find and to go around the medina. 2. We felt super secure and relaxed @ the hostel. It is clean and has good facilities. 3. All people who worked their were super friendly and were extremely helpful.  One of the the girls - Shorok gave us an Arabic class and it was really good. We learned a lot and we practiced in the streets of the medina. We also met the owner of the hostel who was pretty cool and took us around a bit telling us about their culture and tradition. 4. Breakfast was great....oh yeah. One of the guys makes the best tea ever! :) 5. Dar Rabha is super beautiful. Really nicely renovated and decorated. The rooftop terrace was really nice to chill out. If we go back to Fez we would definitely go back to this place. Shokran Dar Rabha!"
"We wanted an authentic Moroccan experience, and we couldn’t have asked for a better place to find it than Dar Rabha.  We had heard that Morocco – and Fez in particular – was notorious for hustlers, but from the minute we arrived, the owner, the mastermind, the “concierge,” and now our friend, Aziz, treated us like family in his home.  If we wanted tea, the tea would be ready within minutes.  If we wanted a guided tour of the famous Fez medina, a guide was waiting for us the next morning.  We wanted to try street food and Aziz took us to his local place where a delicious sandwich only set us back 5 dirham (~$.50).  Be sure to take him up on dinner at the Riad, where you’ll be served an authentic Moroccan meal (sometimes cooked by his sister, a chef) family style with all the other guests (who were as friendly as can be).

Fez can sometime seem overwhelming and the streets are notoriously empty after the sun sets.  The terrace, open all night to friendly guests, is the perfect place to drink tea, smoke hookah and make some new friends.  We can’t recommend Dar Rabha and Aziz highly enough – for the price (cheap), you get so much more than just a room."
"Staff bent over backwards to make our stay pleasant. Met us at the square and walked us to the hostel door, arranged all of our tours and cabs, let us check in well after midnight, offered great recommendations. Breakfast is phenomenal and served family-style, which is a great opportunity to meet fellow guests. Rooftop terrace is a cozy place to enjoy mint tea and hookah with the hostel owners. The only downsides are a snug bathroom and rooms directly adjacent to the lobby, but things were quiet enough downstairs where this wasn't the problem I expected it to be. Definitely recommend!"
"This is a beautiful, typical raid-style building that has been made into a hostel. The rooms are clean and the staff is really friendly. It is a great place to meet other travelers and the location is just by the Bab Boujloud, the main gate into the old medina. The terrace is a great plus!"
"Nice terrase,people and location. Clean and with climatisation. No problem. Good position from bus station CTM.
My recommedantion. Big and tasty breakfast-orange jus, good smell coffe and tea, crepes, sandwich, cheese, jam, and more..   Branis an Martina - jimmymarket.eu :) "
"Amazing place, clean rooms, great breakfast and good location.
The staff are really nice and helpful. Special thanks to Aziz;)
Perfect experience of Morocco has developed thanks to him
I wanted to come to Fez again))"
"We chose this hostel based on Trip Advisor reviews and weren't disappointed. The staff were lovely and we got to know them quite well during our 5 nights there. Each night we were invited to eat with the staff (as it was during Ramadan) which was a fantastic experience. There's plenty of food for breakfast and they have a great roof terrace. 

Our private room was very comfortable, but had 2 windows into the reception/common space which were covered with fairly see-through curtains. If our 'private' room had been a little more private, then we would definitely consider this a 5 star hostel."
"Dar Rabha was an amazing place. Very well situated with great atmosphere...the best was the staff though. Very friendly, helping and chatty:) It was ramadan and even though nobody had dinner booked in this riad (I dont even know if you can?) there was a big delicious feast every evening after sunset."
"I stayed here for two nights, and this was the first time that I felt like I was staying at a friend's house rather than a hostel because of its great hospitality.  The staff, especially Aziz, was very accommodating and friendly.  The drainage problem addressed by the reviews at hostelworld.com was being fixed while I was there, and I didn't have any problem with drainage during my stay.  It was nice to have an air conditioner in the room when it was 44 C outside.  I would definitely stay there again if I go back to Fez."
"It's really convenient. Really near the blue gate and safe at night.  The people here are really nice and helpful! Worth staying!  The balcony is fantastic! The rooms have air conditioner so it is really nice to stay in Summer !"
"Me and my girlfriend stayed here for three night and we had a greet time. The staff was very friendly  and were happy to help us with every question we had.
The terrace was a nice place to meet people, smoke shisha and have some traditional tea. 
Was a very good choice in Fez. 
"
"I stayed here with three friends for a couple of nights and everything was excellent - particularly the staff, who were very friendly, couldn't do enough for us and provided enormous volumes of tea. The hostel is in a good location - in the medina but down a quiet street which is also easily reached from the road. The room we stayed in was clean and spacious and the hostel also has a great roof terrace. Breakfast is included as well and there is plenty of it! although they only serve it at 9am. Overall it was very good value for money and I would definitely stay there again."
"We stayed here for 4 nights in total. At first there was a slight mixup with the room, however this was dealt with in minutes and we ended up getting a better room for the same price. The staff are excellent as is the owner Aziz who helped us with everything we needed, including taxis, restaurant tips etc. Also, all the guests that were staying in the house were very nice, the place seemed to attract 'good vibes'. The terrace on the rooftop was our favourite place to chill out in Dar Rabha, where all the guests seemed to congregate and chat. Overall we really enjoyed our stay here and would stay here again if i returned to Fez."
"My friend and I were just in Fez for the Sacred Music Festival and stayed at Dar Rabha.  The place is hidden gem, particularly if you speak French or Arabic as the people who run it are very nice and happy that we had some Arabic.  They do have a couple people who can speak English as well, so don't let that stop you from staying here.  It was very reasonable price-wise, especially for the value.  It has hostel-type rooms and private rooms, and it was very clean!

They have 24 hour check-in which was great for our late arrival.  We were in a room right off the main sitting area which I thought might be a problem, but it wasn't for us since we were out late for the Festival and were getting up right when people started coming down for breakfast, which doesn't start until 8:45am. 

The only complaint I have about our room was that when we took a shower, there was not enough ventilation in the bathroom and therefore our room was damp throughout our stay.  We didn't really like the comforter either, or that the pillowcases were the same material.  They were not comfortable on the skin to sleep on at all, especially compounded with the dampness.

Other than that, it was a perfect spot hidden away from the main busy streets and a great stay.  The breakfast was great, don't be afraid of communal eating with your fellow travelers!  You meet some great people on the road!"
