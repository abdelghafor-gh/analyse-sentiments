"Its not 5 star hotel, the hotle os worn out and rooms have old furniture like a 3 star hotel, we were only able to check in 3:30pm after waiting for more then 2 hours .
Receptionist are rude and not professional.
The breakfast average , i recommend you stsy at the other sofital hotel thalassa"
"Our stay at this hotel was extremely disappointing. The room we were initially given had wet paint and a strong smell, which was unacceptable for my pregnant wife. After moving to another room, we found the bathroom very dirty. The facilities and furniture were outdated and in need of serious renovation, which made the entire experience uncomfortable.

Breakfast was a chaotic experience—the table was dirty, staff were inattentive, and no one offered help finding a seat during the busy period. Housekeeping missed turndown service for the first two nights, and when they finally did come, they entered without knocking.

The overall state of the room was poor, with moldy odors and dusty surfaces causing discomfort. Despite raising multiple issues with the management, there was no action taken or apology given. This hotel is far from the 5-star experience it claims to be."
"Booked a large bed and was given 2 single beds 
Even when I explained to staff showed my booking 
They attempted to change the course of English language and explain that a single bed can now accommodate  more than a single person. 
Post review customer service was even worse"
"Catastrophes experience that I had in Sofitel
From the First step until the Last
( blood in the pillow, bed not changed still dirty full of hair, small things on the top...)
--》Please you can see the photos
My self and my wife as she's the first time she will visit Agadir I suggest for her hotel sofitel that I was thinking she will be more than happy, the reality of our experience it was so sad and stressful, we lost our day for nothing..
Firstiful Check-in it was so late, just to know we where in the hotel at 11h00, 4 hours waiting, during this time we eat the breakfast it was good and expensive 500 MAD for 2 person, we Walk around the pool, no one from the staff come to ask if we need towel...assistance or something.
Finally we get the room, we couldn't come in because the floor was not dry, toilet dirty, room equipment is Very cheap for Sofitel 5*, the corners full of dust, as i have allergies from dust.. no amenities, it was no Cafe machin, it was not enough place to put the luggage and our stuff..to be honest I was so disappointed.
All of what we faced it makes our experience worst,
At 22h30 we find blood in the pillow, we called reception, supervisor lady and her colleague Mohamed they come to check, the supervisor lady she did not make any effort to find us a solution instead Mohamed he apologized but is not acceptable, we feel disrespectful and we do not trust where will we sleep.
At 00h30 we packed our luggage to go out, one and Half hour we explain to night manager.. he pushed and he forced us to stay 1 night and to pay 3300 MAD, we where front of reception until 01h30 morning. 
Catastrophes experience
I never ever go back
extremely I don't recommend this hotel"
"I have been a member of the All program since at least 2011 and have visited 45 different Accor hotels since then.
This is my worst experience in a Accor hotel.

I made my reservation several months ago for a stay from August 14 to 20 with my wife, our two 3-year-old daughters and our two-month-old baby.
According to the description on the All website, it is an ""executive villa with 2 bedrooms, private heated pool and butler service with a Check-in at 3:00 p.m.""

Before coming, I exchanged several emails with the hotel, clearly mentioning the ages of my three children.

We arrived at the hotel on August 14 at 3:00 p.m.
- We waited 90 minutes before having access to the villa because it was not ready.
- When we had access to the villa, we discovered that the second bedroom is upstairs with stairs located outside. This does not correspond at all to the description and photos on the site. The hotel could have stipulated this to me in our email exchanges because it is absolutely not suitable for 3-year-old children. Result: we had to install children's beds in the living room.
- The swimming pool is located exactly 20 meters from the beach restaurant and is exposed to it. There is therefore no privacy as the photos and description suggest. The smells from the kitchen are overwhelming. And the trash can is located very close to the entrance to the villa.
- The water in the pool was cold. We were told that the pool was only heated at the customer's request and that it would take 48 hours. The technician came several times to try to fix it.
- In the villa, several materials were damaged. The toilets in the bathrooms were not flushing properly. The ventilation was making a noise that kept us awake.
- The butler did not give us his phone number until 6:30pm. He was unable to help us.
- At 5:30pm, a manager (Mehdi) came to tell us that the hotel manager was coming to see us. He never came. He passed on the message via his manager that the villa had been like this since the hotel opened; without any attempt at a realistic solution or excuse.

Speaking with staff members, it seems that we are not the first to notice a significant discrepancy between the description of the villa and its dilapidated state.
It is not suitable for young children or even people with disabilities. This should be mentioned on the website."
"We decided to end the holiday on a beachside resort, or at least what we thought would be nice. But shock on us. 
The hotel is very tired and old 
The staff are even more tired. No one gives a damn about you. From the receptionist to the pool attendant. Everyone doesn't care about you. It took us 3 hours to check in. When they knew we are coming and they knew had early check in. The rooms were old ( they said they just renovated it in May) the other 2 rooms we had were even worse. Ac no working, water drainage poor. We were exhausted and decided to let go and things may improve. The next day breakfast was even more shocking. Despite the hotel claiming they are full. The breakfast was limited, food finished. We asked the waiter to get us an espresso and cappuccino. Despite waiting nearly 30 mins for coffee and reminding 3 times. The espresso finally came, however when the cappuccino finally was brought to the table. Shock it was hot chocolate!! Staff didn't care at all they don't know what items are being served. The staff have a carefree attitude. We cut the stay short by a day cause of this utter useless attitude. Last day on breakfast more horror. The lady cooking omelette gave my kid a burning hot plate whole serving. And when my kid screamed she acted like nothing is wrong. 
Worse hotel I have ever been too. Never again and please avoid at all costs. Stay elsewhere there are plenty of hotels and trust me none can be worse then this so called sofitel!!!"
"We visit Agadir at least 3 times a year and normally stay at one of the Riu hotels. This time we decided to spend a bit extra and stay at the Sofitel - what a mistake that was! 
We booked a pool view room but ended up with a room with a tiny window in the far right corner of the hotel with no balcony. The room is dated, the bathroom is dated and is extremely substandard. I don’t think this hotel has been refurbished for at least 20 years. The bathroom has a poxy shower over the bathtub that works when it wants to, the beds are extremely uncomfortable and the staff are very unhelpful. 
I expressed my concerns to the duty manager Maryam as soon as we checked in and was told the hotel is at full occupancy, however, the following day she will change our room. The next day came and absolutely nothing was done and Maryam was nowhere to be seen. I went to the reception desk and spoke to another manager, Mahdi who again promised a room change within 30 minutes. He took my mobile number and promised to call me. He failed to call, return any of my messages or calls and again has failed to change my room. 
The hotel is disappointing and the service is even worse - definitely not what is expected of a world renowned brand. 
I definitely feel violated by the service I have received and would strongly advise anyone against staying here - there are many better quality hotels nearby that are a lot more reasonably priced whereby real customer service is offered. 
I will be writing to Sofitel head office to express my concerns but in the meantime my holiday has been ruined."
"Theres better hotel around the area for less price. Ive finally get to move to iberostar after spending 1 night. Rooms and facilities ok but this sofitel seems to be on his way down. Its pretty far from the main area in founty."
"I was meant to stay in the hotel end of March 2020 but this got cancelled because of Covid-19, FCO banned all flights to Morocco. I have never received a refund from the hotel, I have sent numerous emails and tried multiple times to call the hotel but there has been no answer no response to any of my emails. I have also tried Accor who advised the hotel is not part of their group anymore and they would not help, very useless. I am extremely disappointed with this service, having stayed in other Sofitel before I thought this was a trusted/well know hotel but I was shocked this time how impossible it was to get my money back. I have been trying till December 2020 to get my money back but now gave up. Absolutely terrible."
"Stayed here to celebrate son's birthday.   No acknowledgement of birthday despite reminders and notes. The rooms were dated, musty smelling.   Seaview rooms are distant from the coastline and not much better.  Found dead insects in the room as it hadn't been cleaned in a while.  Found spiders crawling over a dimly lit salad area in the main buffet restaurant.  most staff are inattentive and dismiss concerns.  Asked for a warm blanket and never received throughout whole stay.  same with them fixing the heating.  checked out after 1 night and never got refunded for the remainder nights stay. had to book with another resort which was a massive improvement.  This hotel is not at all like any sofitel accor range.  Awful and no idea how it's rated so highly on tripadvisor"
"I booked this hotel for April 2020. The booking was cancelled (by the hotel) due to COVID. I have now tried on many occasions to get a response from the hotel in order to receive a refund but they are ignoring emails and the main email address (H5707@..) is now bouncing emails. The hotel has now left Accor and so Accor are providing no help. 

Really bad service despite initially responding well to emails"
"We stated we wanted a twin bed and after the 3 attempt and one of us going to the house keeping staff to help separate the beds this was finally done (with our help) however reception had been asked several times.  The plumbing was terrible, once you pushed the flush the water kept running unless you hit the flush again after the 3rd time. It had a class panel from the bathroom to the bedroom so if you went to the loo in the middle of the night you woke the other person with the light. On my arrival there was no welcome or help as I arrived a few days after due to my flight being cancelled. No explanation of breakfast, wifi or simple welcome drink or help with luggage (previously received this in other sofitels- would expect this in a 5*) Food was a huge problem as one was vegan and we had emailed in advanced and reminded reception and the mornings there was no help or no one knew anything about it, when finally we were able to speak to someone they had said this was ok to eat (cereal and bread) to later find out that there was milk which is obviously against ethical believes. Finally on the last day something was done (4 previous days of nothing!) I had my flight cancelled and therefore had no breakfast and was still charged.  When we spoke to reception again very dismissive. We had paid taxes etc and we were then told we had to pay extra and they over charged. By using booking.com we had booked a free cancellation room (with garden view- this was an alley) however, the money was taken out of my account a month too early with no warning or receipt. we asked for the gym/yoga timetable and they had emailed the wrong one which meant we were not able to do the classes. General cleanliness was not acceptable for a 5* hotel  We have been very disappointed with our stay and when we tried to explain to the reception it was too little too late if anything. We have been to sofitels before and booking.com and this has been a stressful and terrible experience."
"Not the standard from Sofitel which I normally expect. A lower standard in my view. Check in took an hour, Air conditioning was temperamental, breakfast service was slow and waiter service were dismissal. To use the facilities such as gym etc was extra payment, not normally the case in hotels. Overall the hotel looked tired. Would I stay at this venue again? No. Would I recommend it? No."
"This hotel is very tired looking, it’s not as clean as it should be for 5* rating, there was often hair clumped with dust/dirt left on the floor after the maid had been in, the beds were comfy but had a dip in the mattress so quite worn, the food was lovely but on a couple of occasions I had sausages & fish that were pink/red in the middle, and some items were cold. The thing that stands out about this hotel is that the service is poor. The reception area is extremely slow we waiting almost half an hour to check in! And 20 mins to check out! The reception staff appeared grumpy and unhelpful at one point the girl left the desk and disappeared out the back after another long wait we left with our question unanswered!! We never got refreshments on arrival, but saw them doing this the following day. 
The service in the restaurants is also very slow, they’d forget that you had ordered another drink, or completely ignore you! 
The pool area also had poor service, they’d frequently run out of towels and we had an hour wait for fresh ones. If you leave the pool area for a short period of time your towel will be taken. 
Khalid excursion rep was great - we booked 3 fab trips fishing trip, horse ride and Paradise Valley and he threw in a free city tour! 
Beach has strong waves, often black flag up meaning unsafe to swim and there’s big jelly fish in there they have warning signs up about this. 
But would not return to this hotel"
"My husband and I stayed there for a long weekend. Since we live in Morocco, we know the over-inflated star rating system used in Morocco. This supposed five star barely gets a 3. Rooms are old looking, things don’t work properly, sheets and cushions are stained, windows are hard to open. Also since there are no rugs and it’s a tile floor, you hear all the noises next door and upstairs. The breakfast was not worth the money we paid and we regretted getting the package. Here’s comes the kicker on service. 1. In check out day, around 11 am, as we are ready to vacate the room, I need to use the restrooms. The “do not disturb” sign is hanging in the door. As my husband walks toward the door to open it, a man knocks and immediately unlocks the door attempting  to let himself in. I’m in the bathroom in plain view. Thanksfully my husband pushes him out. The guy says he’s there to check the minibar. Wait, what? Before we check out, when you have our credit card on file, in a “luxury” resort, and disregarding the sign on the door? Completely outrageous. He actually stood outside our door and immediately barged in when we left. We hadn’t even noticed the minibar. I complained at the front desk and got a lukewarm apology. The usual Moroccan excuses and blame shifting. No offer to compensate, nada. Fast forward a few hours. We drive home to Casablanca and notice we forgot an expensive and large orthopedic body pillow - due to being thrown off by minibar guy. I call the hotel and I’m transferred to housekeeping. I’m told to call back in the morning. This little exercise went on for three days. Finally the Gouvernante proudly exclaims she found the pillow and would call me to let me know how she could get it to me. Two days later, she calls and mumbles something about a bus company. I provided my contact and address and asked about the cost. Call back tomorrow. I do and get no answer. Call back a couple of days later. I’ll get a call back, never did. I send an email, no answer. Tonight at 7:00pm I tried calling the hotel, NOBODY answers the phone. It’s now going on two weeks. That’s what you’ll get at this “luxury”’resort folks. Do yourselves a favor and book elsewhere. I can only imagine how much worse it gets during the high season."
"Overpriced old property need major renovation, staff is nice & friendly but overworked, poor top management saving on staff that cost 300$/month, new year hotel fully booked 475 rooms, 1 person at reception only, few waiters at breakfast, wait long time for free seats, to sit outside early morning no option. No one answer telephone reception room service housekeeping. Price f+b super expensive for a poor country. If you gave money spend little more & stay at new Sofitel next door."
"Went with a group of 60 people worst service sometimes the food would take an hour to come and food would be cold . Also had made my  other  family memberz not welcome security is very bad they dont have any next to the pool or anything"
"I’ve been to Morocco 4 times now. It’s like my second home. I’ve stayed at various hotels, hotel le tivoli and Atlantic palm beach apart and they were 4 stars but I would give them 3 stars. We booked this hotel as it was a 5 star and we thought it shouldn’t be no less than a 4 star experience at the least, however I was mistaken. As you walk into the hotel, it’s breathtakingly beautiful. The lounge area, pool area and even dining area is definitely a 5 star. There are people constantly cleaning and polishing and wiping down surfaces. Someone comes up to you to meet you and offers you Moroccan tea and biscuits. When we got to our room we were disappointed immediately even though the room was already upgraded from our original room. There wasn’t even the basic complimentary kettle and tea coffee in the room. The furniture and curtains were shabby. It had some weird damp smell to it, and there were ants popping out every so often on the floor every morning. The room was basically of no more than a 2/3 star standard. The rooms in my previous hotel stay was much better than this supposedly 5 star! I honestly think the money spent investing in maintaining their lounge area can be spent In upgrading their rooms over time. They did come and clean the room each time we complained about the ants but it didn’t rid of them. They also asked if they can use any medicine but we said no as my husband has allergies, Upgrade needed."
"I stayed at this hotel several time and left happy. But this time I am very disappointed by the behavior of front desk. After I checked in I had dinner in the hotel restaurant and signed the check to be billed in my room. After 5 minutes I went to my room, the lady in the front desk called me and said I need to come down to pay the bill urgently because I did not leave a guarantee. I told her that I am tired and not going anywhere and pay it later but she insisted that I should come down immediately and pay!!! "
"This could be a fabulous place to stay.. The environment is beautiful and the pool area is so lovely, with a great private beach: However the service is appalling, reception is a joke it took us over an hour to check in and another hour when we asked to print boarding passes, there is no organisation and no attention to individuals needs.What ever you do DON’T SIT DOWN we fell for this twice and were completely forgotten. The service in the restaurants is no better, they all run round like headless chickens, there is no leadership or organisation. FAWLTY TOWERs springs to mind, it was hilarious! There was one exception, Mohammed defied the odds and was able to attend to more than one item at a time he should be put in charge!
The rooms were clean, but the bathroom flooded every time we took a shower due to an ill fitting shower screen, and the air conditioning didn’t.t work. 
We initially thought the security on the gate was for guest protection, turns out they are there to stop you taking in your own bottle of wine.
Some good leadership and training in customer service would make this hotel so good, such a shame the service spoilt our experience."
"The hotel is like any other ordinary resort place. Simple food, definitely not  5*.
The people working are friendly and nicely smiling, they say often ""yes, immediately..."" but then don't show up again, for example when you ask an ash tray.
Unacceptable when I asked for express laundry (+50%) but it's not even delivered the next day. When you forget to ask for it, you leave the hotel without.
I called the same evening to the number mentioned on the invoice, but no answer. The next day I called the number mentioned on the website, and i got somebody who has difficulty understanding, or even writing down my telephone number. They promise to call back, but never do. They also don't answer the email I wrote.
So I lost 3 shirts and 1 pair of trousers, Prada, new value +/- 1.800€. I ask myself: give up, and never go there again? Or is it Moroccan style of treating costumers?

"
"Made reservation via Accor website, and prepaid for the accommodation. On arrival at the hotel I was asked for the credit card I had used to make the prepayment, unfortunately I did not have it with me. I was then not allowed to check in unless I paid again for the room using another credit card. The hotel receptionist told me that the original payment would be refunded the next day. On returning home I checked my credit card balance to find that the original payment was not refunded. Have spoken to Accor Customer Service and they need proof from me that I paid twice. So, warning to other customers of Sofitel. If you make a prepayment, make sure you take the credit card with you when you travel."
"So arrived at the hotel, was asked to take a seat and someone will check us in. All very confusing, we sat at least 20 minutes before deciding to speak to someone at reception. The receptionist was lovely but said our room was not ready until 3. We arrived at 12ish. She offered us the use of the facilities in the mean time. We were greeted by our rep on arrival who encouraged a welcome meeting at 3. The pool area was stunning!! The sun lounges which were beds. And were amazing! It looked impressive at first glance. 
3pm soon came and no rep to be seen! We waited 30 mins. 
Finally get into our room and we were happy with it. 
First meal - looked like their was plenty to choose from but actually their isn’t that much, nothing is served hot like it should be. On our second night my partner started with stomach ache which then turned into food poisoning! We ate nothing but veg soup and bread from then on! I’ve never stayed on an all inclusive hotel and lost weight! 
Looking round the hotel their seemed to be a few single sun bathers and it made me wonder if they too had a partner who suffered the same as mine! 
This is NOT an all inclusive hotel, they run off a menu for lunch which is very limited.  Their is no other snacks or treats throughout the day. The service in the main restaurant was terrible and disorganised. You never get offered drinks and even when you ask it takes at least 4 attempts to get it. On our first night we asked for a top up of wine and the waiter commented saying he’d need to carry us back to our room, it was our second glass of wine !! 
I thought staff were ignorant and you’d never get treated like that in England or European countries. 
I would never consider going back and if anyone told me they were going to this hotel I’d say don’t!! 
The only positive was the pool and lounges. 
"
"I booked this hotel after reading positive reviews. However the service offered is not of a 5* service. I booked a twin room before arriving and was given a room with a double bed. I informed the reception and they moved me to another room (302) which they told me had a double bed but would be separated by house keeping. However house keeping told me this bed cannot he separated 4 hours later. I have been waiting and have not received a phone call or anything from the staff. The staff are also not friendly and do not greet you with respect. The inside decor of the hotel is also not to a 5* standard but outside looks nice."
"The hotel is obviously old and run-down. While the lobby is still kinda authentic the rooms and hallways are in a poor condition. 

The pool area is probably the nicest part of the hotel but the garden also is in a poor condition - no comparison to many of the other hotels in the neighborhood.

But the worst part is the service in the lobby and pool area: Nobody ever approaches you and asks you if you want to order something, we were often just ignored! 

It is definetly not even near a four- or five-star-hotel. "
"Hotel is nice

Lobby is nice

Pool area is very nice no problem for sun loungers

Rooms are very dated

Prices are extortionate for what you get.

Small can of bierre = €6.5
Can of Cola/Fanta = €4
Burger and fries = €11
Milkshake = €10
Spirit = €10

It’s almost double the price of all local restaurants in the area for the same drinks. Food quality for the price is atrocious. To top it off you are not allowed to bring food or drink from outside the hotel inside so your forced to pay the prices they set!

The amount you spend a week here I would have rather have spent a week elsewhere.

Nothing to do, except smoke shisha.

"
"I have just completed a 1 week stay here and have a complete mixed bag of things to say, I will start with positives.

The pool area is generally a nice area to relax and take in some sun and to cool off with a dip.
Staff: the breakfasts manager I didn't get his name to my shame, was excellent and very helpful and the bakery even made gluten free bread for my wife by the end of the week.
Beach is very nice and tidy though I think there is a lot of waste pumped into  the ocean.
Bad
THIS IS NOT A 5 STAR HOTEL.
It may of been once but now its very tired, our bathroom had mould, the screens dont
 close and its a bath/shower combo. The whole hotel needs some investment to raise the standards of the decor to what a five star hotel should attain.

services: again not five star service, the service you get varies wildly and and can at times seem indiffrent.

Food: average and expensive for what's received.

My major gripe with this hotel is you pay five star prices (10 pound for a Coke and an ice cream - 10 bottle a beer in the nightclub 8 pound for an milk shake) yet you dont get the level or standard of service you'd expect for the price you pay. 

All in all too many niggly things to truly leave with a positive exeperience, I'd say a hotel best to avoid. "
"On arrival the hotel looks nice but that is about as far as it goes. The rooms are tired, smell and dirty in parts. Service is dependant on the person you get. Check in staff were nice. I share the same sentiments as many others have in regards to breakfast, slow and hard work.  asked for several items to be brought to the room (iron/ kettle) for it to not materialise until day four. We had to switch rooms in the middle of the night as our bathroom ceiling started to leak. The hotel prices are stupidly high. They charge a lot for drinks/food but it doesn't deliver on quality. All in all if you are looking to come here to experience a five star, don't bother. Go elsewhere. "
"The rooms were nice and relatively clean, the look of the hotel and the pool and beach were really lovely. It was a shame the service of the food and drink was the worst I have ever experienced.

Service was painfully slow in all of the restaurants and the food average, service. It was at times infuriating as we felt deliberately ignored, we couldn’t believe the service could be that bad. One on occasion they got our order wrong, then overcharged us and then had the cheek to argue back when we said we weren’t paying for the order they had got incorrect. The card for our room stopped working. The safe in our room stopped working, locking our stuff in it. We called someone up to our room, who never came after we waited a significant amount of time. We then had to call back the next day. Furthermore, our air con stopped working in the room. We called down to reception to get someone to come, but as was now standard for this hotel, no one come

On the first night we made the mistake of going to the buffet, which was a rip off, the food was average and all the tables dirty, the drinks took ages to come. It was a nightmare to actually get served.  We then weren’t to the big Courtyard where couldn’t get served despite waiters everywhere standing around doing nothing!

Breakfast was a mixed bag. We did have some decent service some days and the food wasn’t too bad. However, I would recommend you avoid the scrambled eggs.

The only saving grace for the food and drinks was the restaurant in the nightclub, which wasactually a pleasant surprise after nights of poor service. They provided really good service and good portion sizes

The outdoor bar, atrociously slow service every single time

Seafood restaurant - extremely slow, 15 minutes to get menus, 25 for orders to be taken and 50 for food to arrive. However, once it had arrived the food was good 

Toilets - Men’s - Broken locks, broken soap dispenser, no toilet 

Women’s - no toilet roll, wouldn’t flush in multiple ones

Drinks outside in the evening, were generally ok. However, we ended up leaving after drinks out drinks hadn’t arrived after 15 minutes. 

To add insult to injury, we were not only charged the cost of the hotel, we were also charged the cost of the deposit twice. We are now £500 out of pocket and they despite saying for weeks they would sort it, they now claim that we haven’t even paid them at all.

Shame it is awful service as it totally ruins what could have been an incredible hotel"
"As you enter it looks lovely but we were fooled, the rooms and corridors are very dated and not that clean , on arriving to our room we had stained sheets and asked for them to be changed which they did. Our room was a superior room but just had a window no balcony. the pool area is tired. they service is very slow if you got any at all. we thought the service was'nt good as we were all inclusive but speaking to others it was th same if you were paying as you went. it was very expensive. we spoke to many people who were unhappy with this hotel. on a plus i have to say turndown guy was great Omar and did wonderful thing with towels :) also Brahim in the dinning room was excellent and helped us with many things and the food was lovely did not have anything that was not good. The Tagines are to die for."
"Went with a group of friends. Great welcome on arrival and beautiful reception area and pool area. Check in took ages, I actually can’t understand why it took so long. Our rooms were not ready well past the check in time. We asked for twin beds but got double beds and had to be moved. The first room we had an awful smell and the shower screen had a huge gap underneath so when you showered all the water went onto the floor. We got moved to the first floor after complaining about the smell and this took hours, each time we went to reception we were told to come back later. The second room was less smelly but not by much. In the rooms there were never enough towels or bathrobe, despite asking for extra bathrobes multiple times they never emerged. 
The food from the seafood restaurant was good. The pool area was beautiful but not enough staff. 
I wouldn’t recommend this hotel. "
"The hotel’s outside architectural design is beautiful and traditionally Moroccan. The hotel’s courtyard reception is beautiful with a retractable roof, lovely furniture and fountains with rose petals.

The check-in was quick and Loubna was very polite, smiley and kind. We were offered mint tea and biscuits which was a good touch. Check out was quick and polite with Wafa. Loubna and Wafa were both nice.

The rooms are now very old, very dusty (I did the finger test on the tops of furnishings and my finger was thick with dust). The mats on the floor in the room were dirty and dusty as was the sofa. The wooden cupboards were old and creaky. The TV remote was on its last legs. The toilet and bathroom was showing signs of age. Having said all that, the housekeeping staff were all very polite to talk to and interact with despite dirty and dusty rooms. 

The rooms need urgent renovation.

The hallway carpets are worn and dirty. It is evident that they do not vacuum clean the hallways.

The pool areas are lovely, there are always towels freely available, security are polite and the private part of the beach is nice with good sunbeds and sofas. Agadir beach is beautiful.

The gym is small, some machines do not work and are old TechnoGym machines. 

The main morning and evening buffet restaurant has great breakfasts and dinner buffets. The waiters are OK, they are too quick to take away plates and are not particularly attentive but they work hard and long hours so I have some sympathy for them. The Friday night Moroccan Plaisirs de l’Orient night is fantastic. 

I had a really bad experience trying to get a kettle to my room and an ironing board and iron despite requesting via email beforehand and having a reply to say they would be in my room. It took 2 days to get them and numerous requests.

I can only give 3 out of 5 as a score due to how dirty the rooms are and how worn the fabric is of the rooms. If it wasn’t for the staff or beauty of the resort’s architecture, pools and beach then it would be a 2 out of 5."
"My sister and I stayed at the Sofitel hotel in September from 7th to 14th this year 2019. The setting was beautiful the hotel lobby and pool area are stunning so was well impressed. The staff seemed friendly and helpful in the beginning of our stay. 
Our room was clean but the bathroom door was broken so we were unable to lock it or close it at all. This was minor I guess as the room was clean and had a beautiful pool gardens and sea view. 
Hotel room service isn’t so great you have to request for towels. For them to clean and for tissue role or anything for that matter. They take your towels but don’t replace them and don’t replace tissue rolls either. All until they are requested. But they will eventually make your bed at some point in the day and provide a never ending supply of bottomed of water and chocolates doesn’t matter if you don’t have your bed made, tissue roll or clean towels 🤷‍♀️
The hotel allows a gentlemen called Khalid into the hotel who apparently works for a company called WORLD2’MEET, they organise excursions for all hotel guests in Sofitel and other hotels in the area   He advises he is a part of the hotel and the hotel has confined this as he had access to all our details such as how long our stay is. Hotel room number etc. He is allowed to roam freely in the hotel and the staff often refer back to him for a number of things showing he is trusted by them. My sister and I booked a couple of excursions with him for Marrakesh on the 11th that week and paradise valley for the next day 12th. We paid for both excursions and he provided a hand written receipt with a receipt book which has another companies heading and title on it ... something we didn’t notice at the time. 
Marrakesh was fine the journey was long but the bus was as comfortable as can be apart from being freezing with the air on on full blast. 
The next day 12th we were to meet in the lobby along with other guests on the same trip who had booked with Khalid at 8:15. Sure enough a drive came into the hotel had parked his mini van outside the hotel gates and came to collect ya bang on time he took our receipts and we proceeded to the van with other guests. We had driven to pick up a few other guests in the nearby hotels and set off for the trip after picking up one final guest Aziza from a neighbouring hotel who travelled alone just for the excursion. 
Not long after we set off we were involved in a major car accident which resulted in injuries to my sister and I and all the tourists on the van but tragically killing the last passenger who got on. 
We are all shocked and hurt this freak accident happened and are very traumatised 
The Moroccan police and ambulance were unhelpful and rushed us all off the scene as quick as they could 
Khalid who turned up representing World2Meet also told us to get back to the hotel 
No one in the hotel helped take responsibility for this including the drivers and or Khalid or world2meet they have caught to deny the accident even occurred and we were offered help and compensation from the hotel which was not delivered in the end apart from a bowl of fruit on each of our rooms. The hotel was completely responsible as were were assured Khalid and world2meet are apart of the hotel but later denied any connections to him or the company when it came to taking responsibility for anything. 
They were not helpful or considered the trauma not to mention injuries we had been through and the fact that were was a death. Everyone has denied responsibility including wolrd2meet who refused to provide insurance documents. 
The hotel ‘doctor’ came to see us poked and prodded us very hard and said we need x rays  and left. 
There was one lady who spoke good English called Asma with an American accent who was kind but everyone else spoke Arabic and French around ya when we couldn’t understand and were not speaking English when arguing with Khalid and another gentlemen who came into the hotel and said he was a part of the hotel and then said he wasn’t again the hotel said this man was a apart of the hotel and later then said he wasn’t. 
We couldn’t trust anyone
We were very disappointed with the way Sofitel handled or didn’t handle us guests and the severity of the situation at hand."
"The hotel location is the only reason I would recommend this hotel. 

I am currently staying at the hotel and thus far I am very disappointed with the stay. I chose this hotel rather than the sister hotel next door because of the kids facilities and heated pool. However, adults use the kids pool and there is a charge for children under 4 years of age to use the kids facilities. This was not made clear at the time of booking. 

The playground is in much need of attention and repair. Not sufficient for babies or toddlers.

If the weather is cold or raining then you are likely to stay in your room. The spa facilities are all at a charge. There in no indoor pool. The so lounge is full of people smoking and doing shisha so cannot sit with a baby. 

The room booked was a superior king garden view. Bearing in mind this is supposed to be a 5* hotel, my room is very much below average at 2*. I requested an upgrade, but I was told all the rooms are the same and there is no availability. I looked online and there was availability! 

I also noted that families with babies were put on the same floor. We had another family next door and whilst this might be convenient for the hotel, my baby kept waking up at night crying when the baby in the next room was crying. Not ideal as families are then kept up with a crying baby. 

The rooms are not soundproof so you
can hear everything. From the lady above walking with high heels to the doors of the other hotel rooms shutting and muffled conversations. 

There are no kettles in the room however one was requested before the stay to make formula milk but this request was not met until the 2nd day. Boiled water was provided in a teapot but the water had bits floating in it. 

The TV has 2 English speaking channels, a music channel and al jazerra. Mostly are French or Arabic channels. The TV set is about 15 years old. Like I said, the rooms need updating. 

There was a hole in the bath tub due to rotting wood. The cleaning staff simply did a touch up and the after smell was too much for my baby. I had to take her pool side until the smell left the room. No considering for the baby that might sleep in the room and how the fumes would effect the baby. 

I booked all inclusive however this I now regret. Half board would have been a better option. The food at breakfast is very good with a large variety. Dinner at the main restaurant is also varied but service is slow. It is apparent that French and Arabic speaking guests are a preference at this hotel. Due to the language barrier it is difficult communicating your concerns and issues to the staff as most speak little English and cannot understand.

Wrist bands are given to wear if you are all inclusive. This is so waiters and staff can tell who gets what food and priority service. I definitely feel that a sub standard service is given to all inclusive guests. For instance, all inclusive are given filtered cola rather than from the can, only local beer and drinks are provided. Food is limited for lunch unless you go to the al la carte restaurant at your own expense. Even the variety of food at the pool restaurant is  limited under all inclusive despite this being included in the package. The hotel was emailed before to find out what exactly was included in the all inclusive and follow up emails were also sent, but no response was forthcoming.

The fish of the day seems to be the same fish every day - sea bass. Whilst the waiters at pool side do their best to serve timely, I could see more attention was given to those paying al la carte. I was waiting an hour for my lunch on the first day. We went during low season so if service is this slow now, I can only imagine the snail pace service at peak season. 

I expected more of a Sofitel especially since it is supposed to be an international hotel chain. I am an Accor member and previously I have always had a excellent stay and outstanding service from these hotels, however Sofitel Agadir Royal Bay, you fall short. 

The hotel is in much need of renovation. Staff need more training on hospitality and customer service. It should not be about chasing a tip! Language skills should be made a priority. Having said this I cannot see any changes being made to the hotel, the services and facilities as others have complained about the same so looks like this review will fall on deaf ears too.

If you are considering Agadir for a holiday with kids/baby, I would recommend looking elsewhere as this hotel is not baby friendly."
"The hotel itself is beautiful but that's about the only nice thing you can say about it. Check in took an hour for seven people, and our rooms were not ready even though we arrived at check in time. The rooms smell like a sewer and staff are incredibly unhelpful. A member of staff practically marched one of my friends to the till to pay for a measly burger. He then continued to watch us through binoculars while we were by the pool. Save your money and stay at the Sofitel Thalassa next door, much nicer staff, better hotel and food."
"I booked Sofitel Royal Bay resort Agadir for my mum’s 65 th birthday we stayed there for 5 nights from 30th May to 4th June
The hotel itself is very beautiful with good service with short walking distance to the pleasant sandy beach
The food was average with no much choice or variety but fruits were delicious sweet and juicy

Overall our stay there was amazing we really enjoyed the hotel and its surroundings 
What makes me put a low score for this hotel as my mum’s silver Jewerlly offered by me for her birthday was missing!!!
It was in a luggage when we came to the hotel and it was there entire stay She didn’t put it on as I planned as it didn’t suit to her dresses so we completely forgot about it It’s only when we got back to London when I was taken everything out of her luggage I saw either silver chain or silver pendant flower wasn’t there It made me feel very disappointed because that meant that someone more likely from room service or room cleaner went through my luggage and took it from there so be AWARE about it!!!
So my mum’s birthday present gone 😢
So little respect how they dare to steal from the clients. That cant be tolerated!!!"
"We are currently at the hotel and our experience has been abysmal from the time we got here. Our rooms were delayed - first they would be ready in an hour, then its was after 4pm (we arrived at 12noon)- we got moved the following day, same issue in getting the rooms sorted delays on delays.... 🙄 At 3 am the rooms smell of sewage🤢 We asked for robes it has taken 2 days to get 1.. just 1!! Tv doesn't work in the room. We went to Thalassa for dinner and the treatment there was by far better than the royal bay. If you're looking for just good photos by the pool then i would recommend. But if you're looking for pleasant service and good rooms (the bare minimum for any hotel) STAY AWAY!!

SO LOUNGE is an amazing club!!"
"Good reception, great food and restaurant. Bad smell in rooms and hallway . Rooms need decorating , downgraded toilet paper , housekeeping was bad badly responded to requests called for an iron 4 times and when it arrived it was faulty . The hotel pool area was tired and needed upkeeping with garden to maintain, not a well thought out rooms and smelly and badly kept hallways with dirty carpets , this is not a 5 star hotel we paid for it’s more of a 4 star ! We complained to management which We got ignored! Good 4 star bad 5star !"
"Check in was very slow compared to other 5 star hotels. Lobby area was beautiful.

Our room was specially decorated on request which was a pleasant surprise for my wife. They also upgraded us to a pool view room. However the room had a foul smell and had many defects.
After complaining to the manager she apologised and said she would change our room and upgrade us again.
The room change took the best part of an hour even though I was told 10 minutes. Our new room was better but again with minor issues which I decided to ignore and accept.
I was informed I would receive complimentary snacks which even after 3 days haven't arrived.
I requested an iron 3 times which finally arrived over 12 hours later.
Our first evening was wasted waiting to move room and receive the iron. Ended up going out with creased clothes.

Breakfast was nice with a large selection, however the service was poor. It seems there is a lack of communication between staff.

Room was cleaned daily but to a poor standard. Housekeeping took our hand towels and never replaced them. Gave us a toiletry bottle which was busted so leaked everywhere.

I would not recommend this hotel due to its poor service. Nothing like other 5 star hotels I have stayed at."
"There is wear and tear everywhere you look in this hotel except the lobby. The reception staff is rude. We had multiple issues with our telephone we had to ask repeatedly for someone to come clean our room and to fix the phone. No one ever apologized or anything. We had dinner in one of the restaurants and the food was awful I ordered a salad and was served visible old and wilted lettuce. I do not recommend this hotel to anyone and wish we would have chosen to stay somewhere else it truly ruined our vacation. "
"I travelled to Agadir Sofitel Royal Bay with my boyfriend, we booked all inclusive and this is our experience. 
First of all as an all inclusive guest you feel less worthy and as a non all inclusive guests the prices are ridiculously high.
Before our travel we checked the reviews and saw they weren’t all that good, however we said let’s see for ourselves and make our own opinion.
To be honest I wish I listened to all the people that already complained and chose another hotel.
I have never experienced or seen anything like this and have nothing positive to write.
Service is unbelievably slow and they act as they do not care, they gave me the feeling that they do want your money but do not want you there.
At breakfast we would always order coffee which would always come without a spoon – every single morning for 14 days. One morning we ordered our coffee and took boiled eggs of course no spoon on the table. Then we got our spoons for the coffee and asked for an additional one for the eggs where I got a reply that I already have a spoon. Another morning it was really sunny and all the tables for 2 people were in the sun so we decided to take a bigger table in the shade where another waiter came to us and said we can’t sit there because it is for 4 people and we should take a table for two (of course the restaurant was not full and the whole time we were sitting there not one table for four people got occupied. 
The worst place due to service was the pool area where you are most of the day. Not once did it happen that we arrived and someone asked us if we would like to order something. In 90% of the time you have to get up by yourself and walk to the bar to get your drinks. Even if you try to call them wave at them it doesn’t really work. Once we arrived later to the pool asked for towels the guy working at the towel station didn’t have any clean ones so he actually offered us used ones (no I am not joking). One other time they didn’t have any towels (clean or dirty) so the only response I could get was no towels without even trying to arrange any for us.
If the hotel is full any you can’t find a place with shade don’t think the employees will try to help you. They told me it will take 2 minutes for them to bring us a parasol which in the end took 2 hours (with me going to the reception, asking 5 times and in the end talking to the manager).
One of the best moments was when I went to the reception to get a print out of our bill (they were busy - 5 people standing including me) and the receptionist told me “Mam this is rush-hour” and did not print out my bill. My jaw fell to the floor, I actually though I was having a very bad dream.
The best moment was when after complaining and management doing nothing I decided to write a comment in the book next to the reception. Of course, it was not a nice comment, I stated that service is horrible and that I would never recommend the hotel to anybody as I do not want people to go through that kind of torture. Anyways the next day the comment was no longer there, yes they have ripped out my comment for other guests not to see. Now that I find hard core, lying themselves and the guests that they are great with super service and worthy of a Sofitel name with 5 stars.
Much more has happened however I think this will give future guests a picture of this (in my opinion) 2-3 star hotel and in no way Sofitel chain."
"Dissapointing. Arrived at Sofitel on our 5 year wedding anniversary and despite requesting a warm welcome surprise for my husband nothing has been done. Not even a card! Took ages for our luggage to arrive at the room .... this is far from a Sofitel 5 Star hotel.... v gutted. The room is of basic standard and very dark. Our 3 year old is unhappy and does not wish to stay in the room but we still have 2 nights here.. only the v cheap poor standard alcohol is served for all inclusive package... hotel is run down throughout ...we have had to buy additional drinks on top of all the money we have already spent due to the poor quality. Wild cats are lurking around everywhere. The room we wish to stay in is over priced its cheaper to stay in the Burj Khalifa in Dubai when we inquired about costs to upgrade our room. The food in breakfast area is covered in flies and off putting...not happy nor feel in a 5 star hotel. No care about how we feel and cannot wait to check out."
"First day we arrived.. we have been given a room with horrible bed to sleep on, the mattress was out of place, the telephone wasn’t working and we had to go to reception 2 times to order our food not very great start. The service was ok but nothing special the breakfast was always a issue no where to sit and also had to ask for every little things. The location was great next to the beach."
"Check in was slow. There was mold in bathroom. No separate shower. Service in one of the buffets was really terrible even after complaining. A wide variety of food at buffet. Wine prices was good. Would not go back"
"

Stayed at the Sofitel 14-21 March 2019 . 
To start on a positive our first impressions of the Riad were superb it’s a lovely setting in the centre of the hotel. 
The dinner and breakfast buffets are plentiful. 
Our room was cleaned to an exceptional standard and always had some beautiful towel art and fresh petals. 

That’s it though the service is very poor ! 

First buffet dinner had to find a clean table  then waited for service and had to ask Waiter for cutlery and drinks, not a great start for a new guest ! 

Saturday breakfast not one table was clear, we had to ask for one to be cleaned . French couple came two minutes later we were ignored ; their table was cleared and order taken first .

Poor experience Saturday night due to a large function . 
No notice or communication re buffet restaurant closure . 
The whole hotel was crammed into the fish restaurant. No cutlery, no tables and we didn’t dare leave our  seat  as people were coming in & sitting at tables that were already occupied as no presence of staff assisting although staff were running round like headless chickens. 
Had to pester for wine, no glasses had to go to bar with same glass to be replenished or risk losing it . 
An English customer was complaining and tor the bill up in face of bar manager all the staff just laughed . 
More English were not getting served.  French all served or those with no all inclusive wrist bands . 
Bar closed at 11 pm even though people were  not getting drinks served from 9:30 pm 
Due to the chaos we couldn’t get to the bar so went to  reception to order 2 mugs of tea and were told we had to order room service.
having complained to the receptionist he told the bar to serve us with tea. I couldn’t believe it when a Frenchman on all inclusive came in bar at midnight ordered rose wine and got it .  Absolutely discussing service . 

Monday lunch in  Argentire . Al a carte . No one showed us to a table. Had to ask for drink service, a menu and then olives and bread. Ordered food  & water which never came had to ask again. Order stated served with chips or rice . Requested chips none came . They never Ask you if you would like a drinks top up unless your paying . 
Later at the poolside asked for drinks  no smile felt like we were asking for the earth and had to ask twice for ice . 

Tuesday night ordered 2 red wines no clean glasses dirty ones washed in the sink when served had lipstick still on the rim .

Moroccan night poor service yet again the brits table were always asking . 

Pool service Wednesday I ordered water, which on a positive does come with a ice bucket . We both fell asleep for a short while & on waking up we discovered ice bucket and water gone ! 
Asked the waiter for more he returned with a 3rd full bottle of water; not even sure if it was ours !! 
Riad Wednesday night sat down to get a cocktail no one came to us . Gestured for a menu to a waiter just stood around . He told another waiter who just looked at us.  After a 20 minute wait,  I got my own menu still no service. The manager came over on our request and took our order regretfully . 
Never asked us again for another drink or had any eye  contact from waiters . 
Whilst waiting for a menu 3 locals came in got served by the water straight away . Then  a male and female came in, All the waiters and manager couldnt clear a table quick enough OMG .

TUI rep Dorata was very good used the app and she represented our disappointment to management. We were compensated by the hotel upgrade room, free Moroccan night free al a carte  booking and cocktail . 
Still the service was not even second rate . 
AIl inclusive drinks is very poor only 2 bars and the main Riad not available for All  inclusive. The Le Nasse Bar is rather small and Cannot cope with the volume of customers. If you’re thinking AIl inclusive don’t bother poor service and poor drinks . 
We also noticed that all inclusive guests were served in plastic glasses at the pool but if your paying you get glass .
This is the worst 5* experience we’ve ever had. 
"
"This is a 3 star hotel.

I booked the ocean view room, imagine the surprise when I saw the tiny little dark room and tiny windows and no balcony.
My tv didn’t work. Someone came that said in 5 minutes (he didn’t speak French or English), i wait till early morning.... I asked them to do my room but they put 3 hours to send someone.
By the pool or elsewhere, you need to ask 3 times to have something.
In a real 5* hotel the bed is perfect, here it looks as a bumpy mountain. The mattress cover they put is smaller than the mattress, it seems like a motel in a desert! So cheap.
I came to relax and sleep but it is not for this trip apparently."
"This is a nice if slightly run down hotel. For example, there is a good picture of the gym on the website but only one piece of cardio equipment actually works. I think this sums the place up. The lobby area is nice, the pool area and the grounds are impressive. However, the service is very poor. I have countless examples of having to ask for the same thing several times before receiving it. I read the other reviews which mention the service so decided to be relaxed about it but in the end, my sense of humour ran out when I was ignored at the ice cream counter for 5 minutes when I was the only customer there. Whether it is delivering hot drinks cold, waiting 50 minutes for a salad at lunch having asked 3 different people or this morning at breakfast (which was quiet) asking for coffee 4 times, nearly every time we asked for something the service was poor. I've only listed 3 examples but I could go on. This is clearly not a cultural problem as the service in the restaurants along the promenade is excellent. The only person who I thought understood service culture was Smakel Brahim and one of the receptionists. 
Morocco is a nice country and Agadir has a lot to offer but we won't be returning to the Sofitel."
"Just arrived. Well words fail me... Tired, dated, poor cleanliness, and closer to 3 star.
Tui you have over misrepresented this Hotel and need to wake up to some of the false reviews on TA pretending its standard is higher than it is to bump up its rating.
Demanded a change of Room after finding a dark bedroom, no balcony, dirty window looking at well... a tree and nothing else. It was sold as a Double with a garden view. Tui you have misrepresented this room and the level of the overall standard here. We always book with Tui, 5 star and normally happy.
We were given another room at the back of the hotel with terrace. But for £2.5k we feel ripped off and very angry.

We are going to see if we can move Hotels. We stayed at Riu Tikida Palace 3 times and excellent high standards and have never been disappointed. Fingers crossed.

My advise avoid and go to the Riu Tikida Palace. 200% better at a similar price."
"I had booked this hotel based on all the reviews stating it was excellent and of 5* quality and because I have stayed at many Sofitel hotels across the world but this has to be the worst and has really put me off. It took 2 hours to check in, when we got to the room, all three rooms were infested with ants and the bedsheets were dirty, but we still didn’t cause a fuss and only had one of the rooms changed where the baby was sleeping. The staff are unapproachable, asking for basic things feels like a chore as they do not respond and keep you waiting for hours. For example I asked for an iron & waited 3 hours - bearing in mind I had to remind staff and ask them again during this period.  The toilet was blocked after the cleaner had been after telling the staff this still hadn’t been resolved nor did we get any update as to when it would be fixed.  When having breakfast I asked for tea and a spoon, I had finished my breakfast and even after 45 mins this had not arrived. The hotel room keys stopped working on a daily and each day I had to inform the staff at reception to reset my keys. These are basic things  which you would expect from a hotel without hassle. I have had a terrible experience here & as a family of 6 we have booked 3 rooms thinking this would be a pleasurable stay. In future I will refrain from staying at Sofitel as it’s not what I expected, without prejudice I believe European people are treated much better and had seen staff serve them with a smile, providing them with tea / coffee immediately. When sitting in the lobby everyone has been provided with a menu and has been approached by staff members to ask for drinks, we were sat there for 1 hour and not one staff member approached us. I always treat people with respect and believe you should be treated back in the same way but do not think Sofitel staff possess good customer service when dealing with people other than Europeans. I’m really upset with the service provided, it has only been day 2 and I feel like leaving and checking in elsewhere. This was suppose to be a relaxing break and has really ruined my time. "
"From the moment I stepped into the hotel the awful experience began.
I was seated without being informed of how long I would have to wait until I could be checked in. 

No one returned to tell me to check in. I approached the check in counter my self and I was dealt with one of the worst staff members I've ever had the misfortune to deal with.
I was told to leave my passport with her and then she would come and get me.
I returned to my seat and waited for over 30 minutes. Eventually I got back up and went to see this lady again and it's like seeing me prompted her to start checking me in. She was constantly on her phone and she was very rude. She told me I had booked through booking.com when I had actually booked directly through the Accor hotels website.
Then I was told I caused a problem for turning up before 3pm. I was not given a room until 4pm.
I was also given the wrong room. I booked a twin room and was given a double room.
I was also told I could not bring my Alcohol I had purchased at duty free into the hotel as it was forbidden.
I was made to feel like a criminal for having alcohol with me. This same woman also  told me I could bring the alcohol in quietly if I returned downstairs two hours later with my suitcase.
I tried this two Hours later and I was not allowed to bring the alcohol inside.
Suddenly I was told if I paid 200 dirhams I could bring the alcohol in, even though its forbidden. 
Mouhsin at reception was brilliant and very courteous. The only helpful guy at reception. 
He told me his Supervisor would come and sort the situation out. 
The supervisor did not bother even come out. No manager wanted to deal with my issue. 
For some reason the 200 dirhams could not be taken from my preauthorisation I had paid at the beginning of my stay. I had to pay this separately which is not logical at all. 
The least a supervisor or manager could have done is come and speak to me out of courtesy. 

Now the room. 
The air conditioning doesn't work in the room I am staying in. 
The rooms are very small and basic. The beds are comfortable which is a positive. 

I am currently still here as I have another day left of my trip and this hotel is the worst experience I've ever had of being a tourist.

"
"This hotel is a lovely property although slightly tired and in need of renovation in some aspects, especially the bathrooms. 

The service however is so slow and clumsy, you couldn’t make it up. It’s like hit and hope, put a request in for something and hope it gets actioned over the next day or two. I wasted a lot of time chasing down requests, I felt like a project manager. 

- 3 phone calls and 4 hours to get our toilet unblocked 
- In room phone not working for half of trip, never fixed regardless of numerous requests over three days
- Only one set of towels left on two days despite two adults and a child in room
- Chased extra towels and extra pillow for three days with no result, gave up!
- Took hour and half and numerous calls for someone to come to room to help remove a stray bird
- Asked reception for room service (due to broken phone in room), it never arrived. 

Sofitel were very kind to give us an room upgrade and a late checkout on day of departure, although I would of forgone these in favour of not having the issues mentioned above. "
"We were recommended by a friend to stay here as it was our first holiday with a baby! So thinking its a 5 star hotel and child friendly you cant go wrong. We requested a cot bed in our room and we never got one we had to ask once we arrived in the room. The A/C was not working and it was so hot our baby was unsettled and crying because it was too hot! We asked for maintenance to come check the A/C but he never seemed to know what was wrong and hardly understood english! Its so important for all the staff to speak and understand english. We were then moved to another room, and in that room the water in the bath was blocked so we couldn’t shower! By this point we were fed up and asked to speak to the manager. It was unacceptable specially with a baby you don’t need the extra hassle you want a stress free holiday. Also the rooms were very dated and need a fresh look. The next morning my husband spoke with Asma and he told her we were not happy with our stay so far she was very understanding and upgraded our room with a balcony view so overall we moved rooms twice! After we had moved things went smoothly, breakfast was nice, alot of variety everyday, and friendly waiters there to help. The orange juice was tasty! The gates man Rasheed was really helpful and always jolly. Location wise it was far from the main area had to walk down everyday for dinner. No restaurants close-by. Overall stay was pleasant but could of been better."
"DISCLAIMER: I am not a moaner and I am not a snob. This is the first time I have felt compelled to write a tripadvisor review (good or bad) And have stayed in some great (including Sofitel) and some bad accommodation in my life. This place is AWFUL made all the worse by management who don’t care and don’t respond to emails/phone calls to make their customers time more comfortable for them. Oh and it’s meant to be a 5 star...

Issues:
We arrived at 3 15pm and were left sitting on a sofa in reception for 50 minutes with no one communicating to us what was going on. When we went to ask no one seemed to know what was happening and who we were. They asked for our passports again which had already been taken from us on arrival.

At 4 05pm and finally we are informed that our room is not ready but will be shortly.

Finally we are taken to a room that was still not completely finished/cleaned and ready for us and smelled of damp.

When we had a shower the bathroom flooded into the bedroom (which I assume caused the damp smell)

We then changed rooms.

The new room was very nice but we were on the ground floor next to a street and the windows did not close. So a bit dodgy from a security perspective.

We went to the front desk and asked for a technician to come and fix the window  and none ever came.

We couldn’t sleep that night as it also turned out the air conditioning did not work and it was like a furnace in there (having spoken to a few other guests this seems common and something you just have to accept as no staff member ever does anything about it ).
In the morning we asked for a technician to come again.....Still no one showed up.
Finally I went out and found a technician myself in the corridor and he fixed the window, not the air con.

We asked for a portable air conditioning unit so the room could be cool with the windows closed and I was told a technician would come in 15 minutes. After an hour and three calls to reception still no one showed.we went out for dinner and came back and still nothing was done.

When we asked for an air conditioning unit again we were told they only have portable heaters (even tho I saw the general manager claimed they could offered portable air conditioning to a former guest when they complained on tripadvisor about the heat in their room. Perhaps they were just trying to save face at that point in front of future customers).

I have emailed the general manager 4 times on the email he provides on Tripadvisor in response to any complaints (H5707-AM@sofitel.com) and guess what....no response to any of them. So when he says “they try hard every day to improve their service and would like to hear about any issues and talk about them” it’s a stone cold lie.

To make things worse I actually contacted the management here a month in advance to say I was going to propose to my girlfriend and of course no note was left on the system for them to make things a bit special so I’m in a room on the ground floor where I have to sleep with the windows open but can’t actually sleep because I’m worried about the security of the ring I can’t keep/hide in the safe...

These are the major things. Of course there are also many small things too that normally one would overlook I.e stained bed sheets, charging you for bottled water, reception never answering the phone, awful WiFi connection (there are loads more to list)but are magnified when the basics can’t even be done well and no one can/wants to communicate with you to resolve it.

In the interests of being fair. The pool and beach area is nice. But that is it. This hotel is an embarrassment to the Sofitel brand and I doubt has been a 5 star at any point in the past 15 years. But you know what? None of that would matter if someone just came listened to the issues, apologised and tried to make the stay better. You could forgive it all.

Don’t stay here, life is too short. You can no doubt get better for less elsewhere and  if it comes down to an extra £20 a night in another hotel, do it. You’ll thank yourself down the line."
"Please read this review before booking this hotel. Having worked in the travel industry for the past 14 years I know what a great hotel is and this is certainly not one!
I am writing this review from my room and still have 5more days to endure in this hell hole!
So here goes:
Same food everyday regardless of what theme it is. 
If you are a vegetarian like My wife be prepared for daily tagine, cous cous or plain rice everyday! 
Breakfast - run out of English breakfast tea.! 
Rooms-not cleaned properly, 2 of us in the room only one clean towel left. 
I know I am on Half Board but I would expect a glass of water when I sit down in any restaurant, not here, you have to pay for it, a la carte restaurant again have to pay for water and the meal - half board only valid in buffet restaurant
Entertainment - not catered for the English. 
Nothing to do during the day. 
Wet floors due to rain but no one cleaning it up and no caution signs. 
Bitterly disappointed with Sofitel, definitely not a 5 star. 
Staff are nice but management don't seem to care about their guests needs and requirements"
"Took a trip with my whole family including my old mum, disabled brother and 3 year old son Agadir and decided to stay at a reputable and well known hotel so it is more comfy for everyone. Well that was a big mistake..
We got to the hotel around 12/1 pm and was sat around for 2 hours or so waiting to check in. When we finally did only 1 room was ready out of the 3 we had. Hotel staff said we are too early for the check in. I informed them that my 3 year needs to eat and my disabled brother needs to take his medication and eat food. Not much changed. 
All 6 of us decided to all cramp into that one room and order room service. Following the food coming they decided they want the payment instantly as there was no card authorised on the room. I said I will make the payment once I fed my child. But the hotel staff kept on calling and pestering me about it. Had to get management involved.

Made a compliant to management and waited all holiday to speak to someone but no one came. I had to email once I got back.

Very poor customer service from a very reputable hotel brand. 
Staff are unpleasant and look down on you if you can’t speak the language and very dismissive.

However the swimming pool was nice and the room cleaners were really good.

I do not recommend this hotel ever!!!"
"With great sorrow I write my first ill review of a property on here. I love nothing more than normally giving my five stars and promoting deserving establishments. However, I feel too strongly about this Sofitel, and I would give zero stars if possible, due to the behaviour of staff.

Before I begin, I have to add that I do not intend to insult or upset anyone, (despite your staff doing exactly this to me.) I also have to add, those staff cleaning the rooms and the men at the doors were exceptional, and hold a far higher standard than those who you put on the reception desk. 

I find it quite comical how poorly I was treated here, as I was on a work trip with the sole purpose of promoting and selling your hotel upon returning home. 

I'll keep it short and sweet: This hotel provided the worst dining service of anywhere I have ever  stayed. for those considering going: Don't. And certainly do not attempt to order a coffee from a member of staff, they will take personal offence to it. 

Secondly, an extremely rude member of staff barked at me for writing my signature one day when paying instead of my full name. I would love to understand why? I'm kicking myself for not investigating this further on the day. He became very irritated by me, and this manifested itself in the way he spoke to me. I worked in the service industry for my entire time at Uni, and still do now, and yes - sometimes people annoy you, but you absolutely should never lose your professionalism.

The cherry on top, though, has to be those at reception. I have never in my life encountered such a rude woman. Her manager wasn't much better. Myself and my colleague were charged for free water (which is comical). We were chaged over €40. We were checking out at the time, had a flight to catch and were a bit frazzled. We did not question the bill in the moment, but I will not apologize for being a bit spaced out in the moment. 
Upon returning to the desk to question these inexplicable fees, the woman literally said 'Well, why did you pay first so??!' She was extremely angry at us. She began speaking arabic to her colleague which I find extremely irritating as it instantly puts me out of the loop of their conversation and they could be saying anything. We informed them we had to go to the airport and they sauntered around doing nothing for 20 minutes until finally a manager and the person in charge of the mini fridge charges came out and proceeded to tell my colleague she had drank multiple bottles of sparkling water and sodas. My colleague does not even like sparkling water. she told them this, and the actual response of a member of staff was 'maybe you are confused??' no no, I am not confused, I definitely know I do not like sparkling water....

Anyway, since no one explained to me why we had been charged for nothing, I have come to the conclusion that if you buy your own water and put it in the fridge, they charge you as they do not keep proper track of anything and assume they have given you the water. 

Apparently, this hotel are renowned for it, a few locals told me. 

I am sorry that i've had to write the review, it's just that you do not make it easy to contact you. Myself and my colleagues refunds have still not gone through, and I have had to contact via tripadvisor as apparently this is the only place I will get a response. 

I went to Agadir to explore different resorts/hotels as part of my job, and Agadir is beautiful, full of rich food and culture and amazing locals. However, this Sofitel single handedly put a bad spin on the last day of my trip, and for this I am deeply saddened. I would just like my refund so I can wipe this horrid experience from my memory."
"Sofitel hotel what can I say, not good 😌

SERVICE
Bad, slow, unfriendly service.
Staff struggle to greet you, long faces you can tell they are not happy in their jobs.

ROOMS
Rooms are tired and tatty,cleaning standards are basic. Locked out of our room and safe frequently. A terrible sulpher, sewage smell most mornings and randomly throughout the day. Must be from there waste system.

FOOD
Exepensive not value for money, poor quality, limited options, food not fresh,re used and are heated. I saw mould on piece of cake I was half way through eating. Sweet options left uncovered and open to food flies and mosqitos. Would recommend eating outside the hotel very
 cheap and tastes better, though portions are quite small across the board in Morocco.
Hotel food made me sick and unwell.

POOL AREA
Looks lovely at first but all the beach beds are tatty and some ripped.

BEACH AREA
Better than the pool area for me. That could be just a personal preference. Beach area sectioned off which protects you a bit from the hustle and bustle of the locals trying to sell to you tea, doughnuts, clothes.... I don't mind that too much but the people selling were not friendly very greedy only interested in making a buck, even after you buy they will hassel you to buy more.

SUMMARY
I would not say at this hotel again needs a major uplift. I believe it was once good 10years ago. Also spoke with and heard a lot of holiday makers complaining about this hotel.

ENTERTAINMENT
Riad area has nice live jazz some evenings if that is your thing. They have a night club which is open till around 5am busy on a Sat also with locals. It's ok the club is large and a nice design, drinks expensive and they allow smoking inside, I don't smoke so found it very abrasive. 

Overall not good value for money if your on a budget and don't mind roughing it go somewhere else."
"I thought I was paying for the brand Sofitel as I have stayed in other countries and been impressed but there was something did not measure up with this one and I later found out that Sofitel is a franchise and I did not like the idea of being searched each time I entered into the hotel in case I bought some food or drink. Disappointed it lacked the basics like a kettle in the room. The breakfast buffet was a complete sham like I had to have it in instalments, the tea took about 15mins to arrive and then another 5 mins for the milk and another 5mins for the cup saucer  and another five minutes for the spoon.

I do not often write reviews as the truth is based on our reality and since my experienced shaped up the reality of the hotel. I would not visit again despite the wonderful beech which was the best part of the hotel.

Food and drink is very expensive and there is not much within walking distance but cab fares are reasonable. A meal will set you back around £50 to £60 per person with drink.

The El Had souk is the best souk.

If you don't mind a security guard at every corner who looks suspiciously at everyone you will enjoy the reassurance that you are protected but it did not impress me at all.

Hotel Management like most hotels do nothing to stop selfish holiday makers marking their territory on the sun beds and not use them for hours.

I guess my review will be followed by a very positive one and that makes me wonder as I have been reading all reviews and there is a pattern which even trip advisor don't question.

Staff are helpful but they do not know what they are doing which is down to poor management but the people are lovely and very friendly and welcoming. 

I would definitely visit Agadir again and again but stay at another hotel."
"Where do i start and where do i finish..this hotel is definitely not 5 star more like 3 star..the rooms are dated and need a makeover..very disappointed as they are not the cleanest..aircon in the rooms hardly works and we did request for it to be checked several times..the service is terrible..the waiters have no clue it takes 20 mins to be seen to at breakfast time..you order tea or coffee with milk and it doesnt arrive..we were a group of 4 and inly ever got 2 glasses or cups..i think the problem lies in our arm bands as we were all inclusive as the waiters do not seen interested..forget about ordering a drink at pool side as it will turn up 40 mins from ordering..only plus side abdullah and mojvi ar the pool lunch bar were excellent as was the chap at the beach..defo will not be coming back as the prices charged are way beyond the 5 star package they offer.."
"Stayed for one week at Royal Bay Sofitel Hotel with my partner. We choose it because of the reputation of The Sofitel Group.  This was a big mistake. The hotel boasts itself on being a 5 Star establishment but it’s fair to say that that it would struggle to reach a 3 Star standard.  We checked in just after midnight and ordered room service. The food was OK but was a tad expensive for what we got. The room was clean and comfortable but no Tea or Coffee making facilities were provided which you normally get a 3 Star establishment. Breakfast the next morning and several mornings thereafter was a complete sham. We requested one Tea and one coffee. It took a while for 2 cups to arrive then a few minutes later the Tea and coffee came, we then asked for milk which took a further 5 mins, we then requested tea spoons to stir our drinks which were forgotten about altogether and I went over to The Dumb Waiter to fetch them for myself. We requested orange juice and that was brought to us in a flash, so why the issue with the hot drinks? The food was So-So, nothing to rave on about. They have Two lifts at The Hotel but only one was in use for the entire week we were there, waiting for the small lift seem to take a long time especially at peak times.  No reason could be given why the other one was not in use!  There was never a chance to get a sun bed after breakfast until about 4pm. It’s the same old storey, people go down early and place their towels and a pair of old flip-flops on them and disappear for hours preventing anyone else making use of the facilities, when are The Hoteliers going to get their heads round that common issue? The pool area was nice, clean and supervised and credit to the staff as they were doing their best. During the entire week when cleaning the room, they removed ALL the towels, on our return many times we had to wait for them to replenished so we could wash etc. A few days in we requested a change of rooms as we asked if a balcony room was available, they moved us, and the room was lovely apart from broken electrical socket hanging out of the wall which was live. (see pics).  We paid for an Ocean view and between us and the Ocean was a brick wall and rotting Decking and unless you stood on tip toes and then you would get a glance of the Ocean (see pics).  On one occasion at Reception we witnessed a couple who were rather irate claiming that they had been waiting 3 hours for their room on arrival raising their voices and saying very un-complementary things about the Hotel and Its staff, it was an embarrassment for everyone. We went shopping one day and, on our return, we were stopped at The Hotel Entrance and they decided to search our bags, this has never happened to us in all the Hotels we have visited in The World. They were looking for Food and Drinks and it is Forbidden to bring them into the hotel in case they lose a sale of their own products which the prices are greatly inflated. The Security at The Hotel have Men in Black Suits everywhere watching your every move, they don’t smile or greet you, they just stare through you which is little off-putting when you are on holiday. On a couple of occasions our room keys were deactivated, when I asked reception they blamed my phone which was locked in the safe always, then they said “Theses things happen” …!   Don’t bother going to the Nightclub, no-one else does as I have seen more people in a phone box than there was in the club. The Tuesday Moroccan night is as miserable as you can get, the food was poor, and the entertainment was un-inspiring and priced at £30 per person was a bit expensive. One thing did make us laugh was the public toilets, the lights are on a timer that senses movement but only by the entrance. Whilst using a cubical my partner and myself experienced complete darkness hoping another customer would come in so the lights would go back on…!         
The overall location of The Hotel is not good should you wish to walk to any facilities nearby such as restaurants or bars, everything is quite a long walk away so in the evenings you have no choice but to remain at the Hotel unless you take a taxi. 
I really can’t fault the staff at all, they are hard working and willing to do their best for you, but they are Lambs led by inexperienced Shepherd’s. By putting a suit on a person does not make them a leader of people.
I feel this Hotel Lets down itself and most of all it lets down The Sofitel Group. Maybe it is a franchise but it’s one I will not return to and advise others not to go to."
"Got there by 13h. They invited us to the pool. The room was supposed to be ready by 15h. Checked in at 17h45. No electricity, no A/C and rose petals barely covering the dirt on the floor. Callin front desk, no answer. Ask for service straight at the reception and receptionist (Esma) told me these are all things that happen in a hotel... Sofitel is usually awesome. This one is terrible."
"Right i will provide a full review of this hotel. Me and my friend came to Agadir to celebrate my birthday for 7 nights and overall we both wished we didnt come here. Staying in room 108. We are both huge fans of the Sofitel brand as its a trusted brand and where ever we go we always book with Sofitel. However this trip proved the brand we are used toois not consistent across the globe.. clearly.

DAY 1:
We went down for breakfast and we had to wait forever to get tea and coffee. When it did finally arrive they didnt even bother to bring milk or ask if we wanted milk. The constant  chasing of staff became exhausting. 

Housekeeping seemed to start off ok and the staff member even introduced herself to us.

The customer service was non existent and we expected more from the Sofitel brand. No one says hello.. no one smiles.. no one seems to care.

DAY 2:
We booked a hammam and massage off site.. that went well.. got back to the hotel.. again staff are like robots.. no one says hello.. no one smiles.. no one aeems to care. 

We ordered lunch at the pool resturaunt.. another huge disappointment. I ordered a fish mixed grill... what a waste of money that was. There was 2 pieces of fish..some smelly rice.. i small lettuce and 2 slices of tomatoes as salad?  I ate what i could as i was hungry but the food was awful.. tasteless and bland. And where was the mixed grill??? I expected a variety of fish as it was meant to he a mixed grill?

Again customer service was horrendous.  Waited forever for drinks..for water.. unclean cutlery.. poor service.. very poor.

DAY 3:
We booked a citytour and that was great dub.. as our guide spoke great English and was incredibly knowledgeable. 

Got back to the room to relax and started to notice towels were bot being replaced.. room wasnt being cleaned properly... when we would try to ring reception no-one ever answers. This was the case from day 1 by the way.

That night we ordered room service and I ordered spaghetti Bolognese and I swear the meat off and the meal edible due to the smell.. taste and look. I tried to eat it but wasnt impressed. 

DAY 4:
This was our first day by the pool and we had to wake up at 0700 and secure a bed.. else it all gets by 0715.

This day was better as we did not have to interact with any staff. However tue room wasnt cleaned properly.. dirty plates and glasses were not removed.. towels we not replaced.. again.

My friend rang to get the iron but had to wait an hour for it.

I went up and rang house keeping for towels and fresh bath robes.. they said its coming immediately .. 30mins later nothing.  So i ring again.. 20 mins later still nothing.. so i ring the reception until someone finally answers.  So i tell the lady abt the situation and she promises it will be here.. 90 mins later still nothing!

So i come back down to the pool after wasting over 2 hours.. no apology.. no explanation.. no nothing. 

This is not what i expected from Sofitel. 

DAY 5: 
We are due to go on a boat trip so we try to 2 x towels. Oh boy .. how difficult was that.

On the night of our arrival we did not get a full low down of the do's and dont's so we were not told abt the towel process. We spent 15mins trying to take a couple of towels with us as we were not told we needed towel cards.. coz we were not given any... we still havent been given any from reception despite the shenanigans that took place around it.

Got back fromthe boat trip and ordered room service again for dinner... arghhhhh.. what a nightmare again.. the penne pasta was not fresh and old.. had to send it back. 

DAY 6:
I  got up at 0630 today to secure a bed..yayyy. breakfast was tiring agaun as no one offered me drinks

So i had to chase staff for coffee.. came with no milk...
 Waitied another 10mins for milk.. by now my coffee has gone cold.. but there is no spoon.. i really dont understand how staff can have no common sense or initiate . Staff clearly need proper training in all areas of the hotel.. need to be taught customer service and how to smile!

Sadly the staff are still useless.. still unhelpful.. still unfriendly.. still wonder how this could be 5* or a Sofitel Hotel... lets see how the day pans out... i leave tmrw and i have had the worse birthday.

To the Management team at Sofitel Royal Bay Agaidir.. i am hugely dissapointed and have lost respect for this brand due to you and your staff incompetence.
"
"Arrival - very poor check in. Wrong room so we had to change. Staff was not interested in making your stay unforgettable. The standard of this 5 star hotel is very very bad. The hallway smell of old old ... S Carpet is so stained and dirty. Service in general is far from what y can expect. Tennis court is filled with holes and compare with the picture used on the website it is nothing like it. The food is good but last night changed everything - after eating at our favoured restaurant a big fat cockroach passed my feet. The waiter was so stunned that he left without saying anything....... WOW
I have never experienced anything like this and have no need to stay at this hotel ever again. It is simply not worth the money. 
This hotel could only have obtain the stars for the outdoor area"
"Reasonable hotel and facilities, however the service at both the pool and restaurant was absolutely appauling. Nowhere near a 5* service and by far the worst Sofitel (in respect to service) I have stayed in around the world."
"We've visited the resort for 4 nights and compared to other places we've been to in Morocco this was the worst place of all. Depending on the type of traveller you are, we clearly weren't the suitable guests for their target group. (we're not big fans of big resorts for sure!)
I'm sincerely questioning their 5 star luxury mentality and facilities as according to our opinion it's faded glory. 
From the beginning, the rooms were ok but then again if you claim to be 5 stars and have a luxury sense it's below the standard you claim to offer. It's clean and has a bathtub that was the positive side. However, the rooms were extremely noisy so if you come for peace and quiet at night better pray for "" normal"" guest. The air-condition was the biggest joke we've experienced so far. I bear with the people whom are sleeping their in summer time that must be horrible. The corridors smell horrible by the way. Second thing that bothered us are the outrageous prices they charge you for food and drinks. Breakfast cost 21 euro's, buffet at night 35 euros and the food is tasteless, over cooked and very over priced. Drinks are very expensive, most probably even more than European prices. To conclude, we've felt to have chosen for an obvious money oriented hotel that's more focused on earning quick money than giving their guests the luxury experience and service they're claiming to offer. We believe for the total amount of money you'll spend for sure, better options in the area should be available that can give you the luxury holiday you're actually hoping for. There's more to tell but these main aspects covers our experience and opinion.
P.S. In case someone of the hotel feels like reacting to this critical review. It's too bad no one at the reception desk felt the need to even ask how we've experienced our visit. For sure we would have given you the same feedback."
"I have stayed in this hotel for 5 nights and was surprised by the fact that the staff was so rude to me as I was a single woman travelling on my own.

Firstly, I would just like to share with everyone that this is not a 5-star property and although it’s part of a western chain- too bad- if you are alone and female - they will treat you worse than a dog, although it’s a luxury chain.

I have arrived at the hotel and at the reception I was asked for my hotel voucher and was asked to pay for my stay (although prepaid) ... ??? And afterwards they asked me for 5,000 Mad authorisation , which is roughly £400... 

On the morning I was supposed to depart  I HAD TO WAIT FOR 30 MINUTES AND CAME DOWN TO RECEPTION 3 TIMES TO ASK FOR SOMEONE TO OPEN MY SAFE!!! I NEARLY LOST MY FLIGHT BACK HOME !!!

When the technician  arrived he took the mic and looked like he did not care. 
Sara from reception was very nice and kind- and this is the only positive comment of my stay. The room was nice but the personnel appalling !!! Especially the guys with the towels ???? They were trying to flirt with me and all F & B guys...

Even when ordering from the bar, the manager from the swimming pool bar area looked at me as I was a piece of shot because I ordered 1  alcoholic drink...

Sorry but you need to get new staff and I am definitely not coming back to your hotel  "
"Possibly the worst customer service.

After an hour hassle to get a refund on a defective shirt from hotel shop, Hotel manager then took a photo of my credit card on his phone, then walked away. No explanation. Had to cancel credit card due fraud risk. AVOID THIS HOTEL!!!!!

Despite emailing the Sofitel customer service and the CEO directly, no follow up response. 

Very poor, especially from a Sofitel."
"Having just got back from our first family holiday I'm in all honesty disappointed with this hotel. Taking an 8 month old baby for the first time we were anxious so booked the sofitel in hope there wouldn't be any issues. Upon arrival we asked for a kettle and 3 bottles of water each day to sterilise baby bottles. We were completely ignored. I took this up with the manager who apologised and assured us they would be delivered each night. After the first night we were forgotten about AGAIN. This really disappointed us and we felt really let down. 

Other cons. 
Food is ridiculously expensive, I'd understand if this was Sofitel in Dubai but its Morocco. £20 for breakfast, £10 for a club sandwich and £6 for a mojoito is just a con. 

Room facilities are crappy too. No tea/coffee making facilities, no iron and faulty safes across both rooms we booked. 

Service wasn't great, felt staff were too busy acomadating French guest and would ignore you if you called them over or just disappear following a simple request. 

Breakfast buffet was standard as was the evening dinner buffet. Absolutely nothing special given how expensive it was. 

Pros
Room was more then fine, large comfy bed. Housekeeping were very efficient and are a credit to the hotel. 

Grounds are impressive, reception area is beautiful. Disappointed to see the pool wasn't heated and there was no indoor pool. 

Advice. 
Don't bother with the the spa facilities the same massage or treatment will cost you a quarter of the price on the strip or city centre. 

Eat out if you haven't gone all inclusive, again it's significantly cheaper outside the hotel. 

Given our experience I wouldn't return to sofitel but would definitely visit Agadir again. 
"
"This hotel is not as described. It’s falling apart and front of house staff are very rude and inconsiderate. Be careful with what you eat as most guests including us got upset stomachs. The chicken was raw and recooked when we pointed this out. Everything about this hotel is way below 5 star I would say more like a 2 star but with 5 star prices be prepared to pay 6 times the amount for a bottle of water or fizzy drink."
"This is not a 5 star hotel, maybe 15 years ago it may have been. The hotel is falling apart and most things are broken and front of staff are rude. I can’t believe this is a Sofitel Hotel. In contrast there hotel next door the Thallaso is very nice and modern. Attached a few of the many photos of the condition of this hotel. Take note of this review I’m not normally one to complain so if you want luxury then go somewhere else.

"
"The hotel is stunning. We arrived with the sun shining two and a half hours ago excited and ready to cool off in the pool. Sadly despite asking/nudging several times and being asked for our passport on 4 occasions ( v poor staff team comms) we still haven’t got our room, we booked a deluxe balcony room and having been offered the lesser terrace room in a darker corner without the promised sea view minutes ago we opted to wait another hour for the room we actually booked, so we have missed the sun, not been able to unpack and properly relax. Real shame. The staff really missed a trick, we were simply told to ‘reposez’ which was difficult to do calmly after such a long frustrating wait, no one told us we could grab a drink or take a look around or have the hotel into briefing which would have lessened the poor first impression. I do hope to write a happier review at the end of week, if we ever check into our room and get our beach attire to enjoy the sun?!?"
"The hotel itself is very beautiful and the grounds give a very nice authentic feel! However our stay was atrocious! The service was very slow and the front desk and reception staff were awful! We arrived at the hotel after a long flight and were kept waiting for ages for check in. The reception staff were clearly not understanding what we were saying and did not know how to check us in! Found them to be rude when answering questions and generally unhelpful. Through our stay we were constantly having to go to and fro from reception to get anything done.....which really is not what u want to be doing on holiday! When requesting a late check out (as we had a night flight and 3 young children) we were told we were an inconvenience! For a big name branded hotel they really should invest in training the  front of house! Utterly disappointed and will definitely not be visiting again! In fact will think twice before booking a sofitel again!"
"Not at all impressed by is hotel, which is far from 5*.  We went for the all inclusive option, but on arrival was told that this only covered 1 of the 3 restaurant options, which was the buffet.  The drinks deal finished at 11pm, after which we had to pay full (and massively overpriced) amount for drinks.  The bars only had one bottle of local spirits per day, and when that was gone it was gone - no alternative offered.  Generally the whole deal seemed to be trying to catch you out so you accidentally ordered something off package and therefore had to pay.  

There was nothing on their website to suggest this would be the case. When we questioned this with reception on arrival they simply said 'well we inform guests of what the deal includes when they arrive'.  Hardly how a 5* hotel should operate....One small bottle of water per day (otherwise you had to pay for the ones in the mini-bar), no toiletries, and a dated room and bathroom.  

Really unimpressed by the whole hotel policy which was much more geared towards making money where it can rather than the enjoyment of the guests.  A lot of money, which could be much better spent at another hotel.  Won't be staying at a Sofitel again."
"The worst sofitel I stayed in. This is not 5 star property. It can barely pass 4 star. Customer service is non existent. GM doesn't respond to email to complaint I sent. The service was so bad that I decided to check out at night.

I recommend Accor to change it to Mercure."
"I had a ver bad experience in this Hotel with a very lack of costumer service for a 5 start hotel, 
I checked out 1 early due of their bad service, I sent an email to Front office Manager & to the General Manager But No Reply At All  . They have no costumer value, 
I totally do not recommended to people who use to stay in a 5 starts Resorts or Hotel.
I don't see that's they deserve to be a 5 star Hotel, 

Khalid"
"20 minutes nobody approached me and still waiting !!! till the waitress passed by to clean a table that was next me and i still had to call her. she came with the treys on her hand and wasn't happy that i called her. by the way it is not a matter of under estimating me because there is no reason or fact to do / think so :-)
It took more then 10 mins to have it served."
"Before writing this email I have tried to find a contact email to email management but can't seem to find this. So I will have to wait for management to read and reply to my review.  

On arrival, we had to find our voucher for check in, I'm not 100% why you can't check in without but we found it after sometime on email by phone bit of a hassle with a child but we found it and got checked in. 

A nice young lady called Saadiya showed use around the hotel. She was very helpful and welcoming. 

We have just come from the marrakech branch so was a big difference in 5* hotel. The pool and outdoor space is much bigger here however the down points started to roll in. 

The room is a big let down,  out dated and stale . We was unable to Un pack our bags as we had no space to put things. 
I had to request a kettle,  which we then got but for 5* I expect this here along with tea. So we have a kettle but no tea bags, cups ect. I did need the kettle for my sons baby milk but no tea for me... I guess I could order it however with the pieces here it was a defo no no. 

No iron again a must at a 5*, it took two days to get the iron. A iron which was broken and bord which well, see for your self in pictures added. You would get better in a hostel. 

Trying to call room service 30mins latter had to get reception to put use though,  and then a call back saying they ran out of soup. It's only 14.00. Really disappointed.

There is a phone in our room. However no numbers listed,  nothing in the welcome book nothing on the phone to say room service,  reception ect. So pointless having the phone. 

Water in rooms,  a basic basic need. No, we came from their sister hotel who where supplying daily water both In bathroom and bedroom including sparkling, so 6 bottles per day re filled when room cleaning happened. 
We get here and are given two small bottles not 250ml bottles but more like 150ml.  OK so there is three of use. We need for both drinking and brushing teeth as ur get a bad tummy if not and we now all do have a bad tummy . I had to go to reception at 9pm to talk to someone as no one answering recipient phone or its busy.  we need water to make up my childs milk.

Considering your paying full wake and the highest price for food and drink I have seen, matching dubai prices. It's a joke. 

Following this your consiourge was again a let down.  Not only did they lie to me about pricing they also did not explain the tour they had put my family on. A simple crocodile Park 140 the man said and took our room number nothing was told about paying when we got there. Lucky I had taken a credit card as we didn't take cash as it was our last day. I then had the embracing moment having to pay when we was there on a English credit card.  which was not 140 each but 180 each.  I spoke with reception and a different concierge worker as the man who I spoke to suddenly disappeared but not one bothered to contact me back. 

Lastly we had so many disturbance in out room (139) firstly when it says do not disturb we had people knocking with irons we asked for two says ago, people brining water why not do this when they clean the room most if not all the hotel we have stayed in do this. Then on one night someone at 11pm knocked on out door three times I got out of bed to find a man saying your bed sheet you requested.  No we did not my child goes to sleep at 8pm and this is what we get.  Then someone must have check in the above room and the sound you get feed,  doors and chairs being moved all hours ridiculous.

I am really angry this hotel made out holiday such a bad one. 

The staff are keeping your hotel going the breakfast and pool staff are good.  At the beach security was doing the staff jobs while they sat chatting.  The man helped carry a buggy and got the towels.  

All in this was a disappointing let down of a hotel. 

It is the best on the strip apparently but it's 45 min walk to the restraints so not close. 
The outdoor space and pictures are true and look nice but the room, services and price overall not worth it at all. 

Dear hotel management please do contact me to explain yourself please.

"Had a Platinum member of Accor Hotels I must inform that for me
This hotel is not a Sofitel ....
Not the conditions or rooms....
A specially the services I was given,
I didn't field welcome...
Really don't understand accor group, this is a medium family hotel and not the classic hotels I have stay has Sofitel Marrakesh or Sofitel Abidjan Ivory Coast,
The only good experience I had was
At the Spa that provided a very good atmosphere and professional,

"
"Overall a disappointing stay. Nothing 5 star about this hotel, other than the price. The rooms are outdated (they call it 'traditional'), terribly lumpy mattress, food from previous guest in the fridge (old cheese) and when mentioned to the reception staff...they replied 'oh, really?' well take care of it but nothing.
The price is extraordianary for what they offer, Euro 293 for 2 nights and Iftar buffet for 290 dirham (ca 29 euro) per person.
Never again."
"I had read some of the reviews on here prior to our stay so I knew what to expect regarding the over pricing of food and drink. On our arrival we immediately paid the city tax and the receptionist asked for a credit card (had read about this) so we declined this and said we would pay as we go. Offered a mint tea on our arrival and then shown to the room. The view from our window was lovely - not sure you could call it an ""ocean view"" as there is the pool area and lots of sunbeds etc obscuring the view but it was very pleasant none the less. We arrived really late so had to order room service. Pizza and fries. Delivered quickly. So far so good. I think our main issue with the hotel was the pool area. We quickly discovered that if you order a beer by the pool, they were only pouring three quarters of the can into the glass?? My partner asked for the can and poured the rest in himself as who knows what was going to happen to the rest of it. If you're paying £5.00 for a 330ml can of lager you want every drop!! I ordered pina colada which just tasted like coconut milk served in an orange tumbler! 5 *?? I took it back as I did not think there was any rum in it. The barman got another out of the fridge and said ""here try that"" It still tasted the same as the other one so I just thought there is no point pursuing this. The cocktails are around £10!! We went to the pool bar to pay and none of them could tell us how much the bill was as they did not know what we had. We gave them the room number and said charge it to the room. We went back to the room feeling a bit disgruntled about it all. Two minutes later there was a knock at the door. The barman had found our bill. Unfortunately, he was unable to add it all up using his piece of paper and pencil. I told him 3 times what the numbers added up to but he ignored me until I took out my calculator and showed him. He was still not sure it was correct and kept trying to add things on! Including the pina colada that I had returned. The drinks at this establishment are horrifically over priced. I don't even think a 5 star in London charges that much! We went around to the hotel next door a couple of times but it seemed dead. Not sure if this was to do with Ramadan? The pool area was lovely but some people were putting towels out at 6am and then going out all day! Every time we walked to the pool we had to pass the seafood restaurant and it smelt! I'm sure fresh fish doesn't smell. The room service was good and the cleaners do a good job of cleaning the room - as you would expect. The hotel looks very clean but there were some areas that clearly needed maintaining. It's a really strange hotel as you could give some areas 5 stars but other areas let it down - particularly the service by the pool. When we checked out they also tried to charge us the city tax again. Wish we had asked for receipt when we paid it first time. We said we had already paid and he took my word based on the description I was able to give of the receptionist who took the payment? Interesting? If you stay in this hotel and are not all inclusive prepare for the ridiculous prices for drinks. If you are all inclusive watch the staff pour the drinks or even take the can and pour it yourself! Would not stay here again."
"The hotel is beautiful and the location is awesome. However the service there is TERRIBLE. First problem was with the breakfast buffet the staff is totally unprofessional the lady that prepares the eggs. Made herself a plate walked past us went in the back ate her breakfast first. After about 20 mins she came out and started cooking eggs.  There were also birds flying around inside and landing on the bread totally unacceptable.  Next in the evening  we ordered had a simple order of burgers and fries in the lounge area. They forgot about our order after about 30 minutes they served us a cold burger and fries. We had to send the food back and reorder.  So there's a night club attached to the hotel.  I was there had a table ordered a shisha and a drink. I left have a drink my phone and the shisha on the table to go to the restroom.  I come back there was an old man with 3 prostitutes sitting at my table they were in the middle of breaking down my shisha the old man had my phone in his hand and my drink was gone.  So their solution to the problem was to give me another drink set the shisha up in another location because they said you had to buy a bottle to sit at that particular table. The funny thing is they never bought a bottle at that table??? I asked the security guy that lied to me about having to have a bottle to sit there??? He just smiled and said find another table. Actually the live music in the club was nice but the service like everywhere else in that hotel was awful. The only thing that made the hotel tolerable is to take a taxi into Agadir to have your meals. just use this place for a place to sleep.  Here's the kicker when it was time to checkout we stated our grievances the girl that was checking us out never apologized for the hotel.  She just said that she would forward our complaints  to management. We never got any feedback from the hotel and that was a month ago.  In all my travels I have NEVER stayed in a 5 star hotel with service this bad before.  They have no idea what 5 star service entails at this hotel."
"Arrived today for a 4 night stay. The pool area is really nice, as are some of the staff but other than that, it's a very average hotel. Certainly isn't anywhere near typical international 5* standards.

It's really tired and needs a refurbishment.
Rooms lack the usual amenities you should find in a 5* hotel. While I wasn't expecting a nespresso machine (which you often get at these sort of places) there are no facilities to make any hot drinks on the rooms - not even a kettle!) Strikes me they are just trying to extract as much money as possible out of all guests. The sign saying 'no external​ food or drink allowed' at the entrance​ just reiterates this! I understand they don't want people bringing their own food and drink to the pool, but to the rooms really??

Food and drink prices are obscene for Morocco. They would be acceptable in Paris, but this is Agadir!

Even though it's a public beach in front of the hotel, this is dirty and no effort seems to be made to keep this clean.

We booked direct with accor and checked in online, requesting beds for our kids yet when we arrived at the room, nothing was set up or ready. 
Overall, while I wasn't expecting loads from this hotel, I am really disappointed. I'm surprised at some of the other reviews on here. If you travel to Agadir you can probably do better​."
"I stayed in this hotel twice and i was dissapointed both times we had booked 4 rooms and all rooms had something missing during check in either toilet paper or water as well as staff is not trained properly or maybe they hate working here. My niece burned her hand and when i asked about a first aid kit for a burn gel or so no one knew where to get a first aid kit and when they actually got it and opened it there was only plasters in it. I would never stay hete again in fact i moving hotel today and would not recommond it to anyone ."
"This hotel has seen better days.  Furnishings were tired.  Trash in the hallways.  Old uncomfortable beds.  Glad we only spent one night...  Restaurant was barely adequate. Staff kinda clueless and surly... had to ask for everything including napkins and salt and pepper. Really?"
"Ok so you have a young family and you want Feb half-term sun with a short transit time. Agadir is ideal!  No budget restrictions, lets go for the best - Sofitel of course. There is one condition though, you want a warm swimming pool for the little ones.
The villas at the royal bay resort sounded perfect as their selling point is heated private swimming pools.  This is Sofitel so one expects them to deliver what they promise. 
You couldn't be more wrong.
We stayed for 4 days and every day our swimming pool was freezing. We complained upto 5 times daily, the staff checked the temperature and agreed but did too little too late to rectify the problem.  The only action that was taken was to dump an unsightly boiling hose into our pool in the afternoon, by the time the pool became less freezing it was bedtime.

You don't expect this from Sofitel- we know because we have enjoyed their superb hospitality all over the world including Dubai and London.
It seems that in certain regions they care less about their standards.
The real frustration was the need to constantly remind them about problems before anything is done. When we complained we told the butler, nothing happened, then we went to the reception desk, nothing happened- The only way that we got any response was if I emailed the manager who would reply a couple of hours later and by that time it was too late.

On the plus side the buffet food at the caravan restaurant is varied and excellent.
Breakfasts are superb.
The private beach is impeccable and the promenade is gorgeous.

Nevertheless they must address their falling standards before it is too late.

"
"My first time in this country, this hotel absolutely ruined my experience. To begin with the staff were very rude and didn't care about any of our requests ESP the managers wasn't interest in the fact that we had bugs in our bed with hair and insects dead in bedroom and toilet. We were over charged many times, we were served water when we order a alcohol shot. Frankly the hotel is a fraud and you rather personally go to a 3 star and have a way better experience"
"Pulling up to the hotel its absolutely amazing, the staff are immaculately dressed, very welcoming, faultless. 
Everything in reception seemed to be done at a snails pace, check in, problem with the safe, check out. 

Restaurant staff are friendly especially Amal she's fantastic will do anything for you. If you are ordering Moroccan tea don't expect it straight away because it takes a while to make. We went all inclusive after a few days because the food was so nice. 

The week we were there, there was a conference which took up the restaurant at dinner time, we had to use the other restaurant which there wasn't enough room for everybody and because it was the way out to the pool your food was cold by the time you sat down as the door was open. That happened for 2 nights and 1 day for lunch outside we couldn't have any because this group took over the outside area.  

Another thing is it doesn't include drinks at The Riad which is crazy because if you come out after your dinner and want to have a drink and listen to entertainment if there is any you have to pay. As another reviewer said I never saw any food menus being offered around there either.

We only ever went to the beach which is gorgeous altogether, the lads working down there are so nice and would do anything to help you.

Here's the thing we stayed for 1 week/7 days and OUR BED WAS NEVER CHANGED!!!!!
The floor was never swept but the towels were changed and we got water and chocolate every evening. Personally I'd have preferred a clean bed!

I would say if you are going to stay here get a room with a balcony because with the lack of entertainment and the TV's only having France24 in English as the only English speaking channel, there's not much to do!

I am definitely going back to Agadir but I will not be staying here. We have told a manager this but he wasn't too bothered he just said that we will be back to stay there  again, I don't think so!!"
"We came to this hotel for our honeymoon and stayed for 5 nights. All the Staff are rude including management. Service is very slow for example we had finished our food before we even got our drink order. Staff are NOT good in English and some just don't speak any so always getting incorrect orders even after waiting long. Complaints made but nothing done. Was even promised a call from the hotel manager to discuss my bad experience but nothing. Has to be the worst hotel ever. 
Cold swimming pool!
Rubbish breakfast!
Staff ignore you!
Dirty beach and not private at all. 

STAY CLEAR OF THIS HOTEL . 

Thanks Sofitel for make our honeymoon so bad and a memory we will try to forget every quickly 🙁

"
"Just about to check out after a week stay and extremely disappointed with what we have experienced .Due to the Soifitel brand we had expected a high level of service and facilities but the reality is far from it .
With regard to our room which is a Superior with terrace the following issues arose:
_ patio door is not closing properly therefore the wind was howling through most nights _ as there are no windows which you can open in the room it is not feasible to leave the door open when your not there as we were on the ground floor_therefore if it was hot i don't know how you would stay there but it was cold every evening _ the heat regulator or air con does not work
-no TV directory and only half the channels are working
-light over sink in bathroom not working all week
-curtains off hooks
-flowers put in vase in bathroom on 1st day not changed all week 
-room service trays not collected 
All small things but not 5 star standard and not expected for rack rate of 450 euro per night
However it is the service or lack of that is the real issue -a huge amount of staff but left to their own devices and no one seemingly in charge examples as follows
- waited 20 mintutes in lobby to be served one evening whilst 13 Staff members stood by the bar counter watching a match on the big screen - 4 times we asked and each time a different guy went off to get someone else
- whilst at reception to get key asked for tea / coffee room service _ receptionist picked up phone and called me back to talk to room service myself ?
-restaurant opens at 6.30 for breakfast as we were going on tour at 7 arrived at 6.30 - restaurant wasn't set up and the staff walked around setting up whilst we unwrapped plastic off dishes so we could help ourselves !no one bothered that they were not set up - no hot breakfast available whilst we were there 
- overall unfriendly staff - went to reception last night again to say it was really cold -told to dial 74 for housekeeping???no apologies even if they pretended to care but really dint seem to be bothered
Been here 1 week and beside the daily Bon Jour no one seems to care whether you enjoy your stay or not- went to pay the bill last night and not once was asked had we are good time etc
Just to mention as well the pool is freezing and whilst housekeeping seem nice they keep entering the room without knocking and waiting -2 times this morning already and it's only 10am
Have stayed in five stars all over and working within tge industry extremely disappointed with first experience of Sofitel -will not stay with group again "
"If you are used to resort style hotels that are away from the main towns, and have the money to pay for all of the extras then I'm sure this is a good place to stay.  The hotel was clean and there always seemed to be staff on hand to assist, however there were a few things that made our stay not as relaxing as we would have liked.  

Having stayed in numerous other Accor hotels over the last year (very happy with all of them) I was most disappointed with the Sofitel Agadir.  During our stay we felt like everything in the hotel cost extra, or it was not made clear if it was included in the cost (e.g. Spa was not included, that we could tell from the information pack, whereas in cheaper Accor brand hotels it is).  This prevented us from being able to relax properly as we were constantly looking at the cost of a drink or food. As the hotel is a long distance from the main town you do not have any cheaper choice options and either have to pay well over the odds or walk for 45 mins to get a cheaper option.  We were especially disappointed that there were no tea and coffee making facilities within the room which I would have expected as a minimum even in a 3* hotel.

The service we received was good but varied.  Check in was seamless with everything done for us, but we had to wait 20 mins to check out in the morning as their was only 1 individual on the desk and 5 groups trying to check out. Similarly if we asked some people for assistance they were helpful however it was not always clear who to ask and some staff just directed us to speak to others which felt like we were being sent on a run around rather than dealing with our queries there and then (this might just be the way things work in nice 5* hotels).

In summary we were annoyed by a few things, however, its probably a good place to stay if you like this kind of thing and are prepared to spend over £200 a day on food and drink in the hotel.  If you want to see the town and get out a bit more I would suggest going closer to the middle of Agadir."
"When I ask for the manager to made a complain he was rude and unable to understand english we where at the lounge and when we went to dance our waitress gave the table to another group and remove our cigarrera and chischa we never got an apology or our chischa back"
"I was expecting a lot more for a Sofitel hotel. The hotel looks in need of some serious modernisation. You can see the lack of attention to detail on both facilities and service. The Wi-Fi in this hotel is the worse I've experienced in everywhere I've ever been as you can't even load/look at pictures. The service is very average. While on the lounge, I've asked for a shisha and a drink and then for the bill. I've had to ask for the bill again and still nothing. I've waited 30mns just to pay the bill. I then got up to leave tired of waiting and then the staff came running for me to pay... It's a very poor service in certain areas. The worst thing about this hotel is how ridiculously expensive it is. You expect to pay slightly more for a Sofitel which is fine but not their prices. Almost £10 for 1 scoop of ice cream!! The food is not even worth the money. People want real authentic morrocan food and not tasteless and overpriced burgers and pasta. For a Sofitel Hotel and at the prices they charge, they should offer 10 times better service, more entertainment, better food and better facilities. "
"this hotel can't be 5 stars. firstly, the check in takes ages. then you're escorted to your room where there are no toiletry amenities that you have to ask for simple things like shampoo, soap and many more things. next thing is i am taking a shower, and some housekeeping person enters your room without knocking and she notices there is someone in the bathroom, she continues to enter the room. i was freaked out. then there's hardly anything in the minibar. so had a drink at the lobby one evening where i got served with pistachio nuts and almonds. as i'm having the almonds, i realize I'm chewing onto the pit of the olive. CLEARLY they were recycling nuts and accidentally put the pits of the olives from someone else. DISGUSTING.
never will i return nor will i recommend this place. also the restaurant staff at the sister hotel next door is horrendously rude. wouldn't return FOR SURE!"
"Location and getting about
The hotel is situated directly at the beach at the very South end of the promenade. From it you have a nice view on the Northern part of the bay, ships coming in at the port and the mountain with the kasbah.
Because it is the last hotel at the promenade you'll have to take a taxi for everywhere you would like to go to. The petit taxis however are always waiting in front of the hotel and are rather cheap. The downside however is negotiating the price every time. We drove into town for every amount of ten between 20 and 50 MAD (approx. € 2,- to € 5,-). We understood that the normal price should be 20 MAD and somewhat higher after dusk. But the drivers in town seem to have divided the hotels between them. We think we saw the same taxi drivers (taxi numbers) queing up and playing cards while waiting. Not easy to bargain in such a situation, because they decided the same prices among them. But then again, at home we pay over 4 euros to get to the city centre by public transportation.

The resort
Every corner of the premises looks very well taken care of. The resort is set up spaciously. There is staff in abundance, though a large part of it does not speak english well or not at all. Therefor we were misunderstood a few times.
The hotel breathes luxury in every aspect. The pool area is large with lots of palm trees and plenty of sun beds available; one pool is heated, the large pool is not.
They offer amenities like a shop, concierge desk, ATM, spa, gym and so on. There is free wifi (no password) throughout the hotel and in the pool area. Speed is OK but the connection a little unstable.
There also is a program with complementary activities for guests. You do have to register beforehand, as we did for two classes. The cocktail class was cancelled because we were the only ones interested, but they did not notify us of that. The second class was a disappointment as well. The one hour Moroccon pastry class looked very appealing, especially to my girl who loves baking, but when we arrived we only got a brief explanation of making biscuits. After five minutes the ""class"" was over and thus, to put it positively, for the second time we got and extra hour of spare time that day.

The room
Our superior room was rather small in comparison with the spaciousness of the rest of the hotel. Everything you need is there though. Among other things there was a flat screen tv, minibar, two cupboards, a safe, a small desk and a really wide bed.
The mattress was kind of deformed, with a little ""hill"" in the middle, separating you from your lover. Two layers of curtains darken the room very well. Ideal if you're planning on getting up late.
The bathroom has two sinks, a toilet and a bidet, bath and shower in one. The shower was very good. There were small and large towels and bathrobes and slippers as well.
The room is checked and cleaned at least twice a day. They change the towels and bath mats every day, even if we wanted to reuse them, hanging them as indicated on the little card in the bathroom. So we did not plant any trees, I guess (1 per 5 towels reused). What unpleasantly surprised us a few times, is that there were no towels when we wanted to take a shower. They clearly cleaned our room, but took our used towels away and did not yet bring new ones.
What we also really disliked on our chill out holiday was that the housekeeping staff made a lot of noise cleaning other rooms in the early morning, mostly by enthousiastically moving furniture. It woke us and we even used ear plugs.

Bars and restaurants
There are 4 or 5 restaurants and 3 bars, including the pool bar. They also advertise the restaurants at the Sofitel Thalasso and Spa hotel which is right next door.
We only had our daily breakfast in the buffet restaurant and did not go to any of the restaurants. We like to go out for dinner trying to capture a little bit of the local culture. Furthermore, the prices at the Sofitel are over the top! That's why we did not even order any drinks at the pool or one of their bars. Or, as another reviewer onTripadvisor put it in a review about the only non-hotel restaurant at the boulevard within walking distance (read my review about it): who is happy to pay 10 euros for a panini? We weren't on a budget, but we think this is out of proportion. So we preferred to spend our money at other places.
And if you're fine with these prices, combined with the overall air of luxury they surely must indicate service is excellent, don't you think? But we did not quite experience that at breakfast. Juice, coffee/tea and butter are brought to your table, everything else is on the buffets. But nearly every morning we had to ask for some butter, salt and pepper and, pleeeease, a second glass of orange juice. Sometimes it was hard to get the attention of the staff because they were busy chatting with each other. Some days they also started clearing the bufeets 15 minutes before end time (10.30h). Choice at breakfast is very very large by the way.

Sight seeing
There is not a whole lot to do in Agadir. Come here for relaxing and go to Marrakech for example if you want to experience Moroccan culture. Even though there are a few interesting activities to choose from. Visit the marina and the kasbah, take a walk on the promenade, go shopping in soukh El Had or enjoy the animals in La vallée des oiseaux. Obviously you could also book a hammam. But that's about all you can do in the city of Agadir. Of course some other trips are available, but you'll have to travel at least an hour for them.

Weather
During our stay, which was at the end of November, we only had clear skies (apart from some clouds the last 1,5 days). Day temperatures varied between 20 and 25 degrees Celsius. In the evening it could cool off quickly to about 10 degrees. Most of the days there was only a slight breeze, making sunbathing very pleasant, even on the coldest days.

Overall / In conclusion
Let's end with the classical (NPS) question: Would you recommend this hotel to others? Our answer is: no.
We would advise you to choose a hotel offering the service you expect with these prices or pick one with lower prices and maybe still even better service. And if you choose any other hotel, look for one more up North at or near the boulevard or near it. Much better location as for the proximity of restaurants and all kinds of shops. Even the sea is better for swimming there because of the lower waves."
"Incredibly unprofessional staff. Security talk with a chip on their shoulder. Complained numerous times and nothing was resolved. Room service is very poor I do not expect this from a 5star hotel. Spent most of my time in the hotel next door which is Sofitel thalassa spa. American breakfast consist of two fried eggs. 
"
"I'm quite amazed at some of the reviews here. I can't get my head around how this hotel merits 5 stars.

First of all I emailed them before departure, letting them know about our first anniversary. No reply at all. 

Secondly, upon arrival there was no warm welcome at all. We were made to sit at the lobby without any communication, then some lady pops up after half an hour. We were given cold wet towels to freshen up, which had a bad odour due to not being washed properly. We were left stunned from that moment! 

Upon arrival we were ""upgraded"" as they say, but the room was poor for a 5* hotel. Really average. Having just come back from Marrakech, stayed in La Maison Arabe, which is also a 5*, this was a real let down.

I have too much to complain about but to summerise - the service is poor. The waiters in restaurant take too long to bring things over. We waited 45 mins for a cup of tea and sheesha! Morning breakfast, they have no orange juice on display. You have to ask the waiter for it who takes an age bringing it. Standard 5* things were not available like topping up soap bars, shower gels, shampoo etc. When we complained, it wasn't addressed. Having told the hotel it's our first anniversary, there were no special arrangements to make us feel welcome and special. If you're looking for a warm welcome and special catering, don't stay here. If you're ok with being part of a large number of customers and receiving average service, by all means stay here. 

The hotel looks beautiful from outside but the rooms are very average. 

We were left disappointed not having value for an awful amount spent to stay here. I don't think I would stay here again. Never a 5* hotel. "
"Me and my friend checked in on 12th june at Sofitel royal bay resort. Check in was quick. But when we were escorted to the room the couridors smell of sewerage. Nice lady at reception escorted us to the room and then horror started. Our bedding was not dont looked like some one just had a wrestling match on the bed. We called house keeping but it took them half an hour to turn up. There were biscuits in the room when i opened the packet i saw live insects running around them. Please see the attached pictures. We complaint to reception again no word of appology. Bath room wash basin was blocked and smelt of bad swerage. We were planing to stay for 6 nights but after this horrific wxperience we checked out next morning.  Zoom into pics and u will see creepy crawling insects with legs. This was my second stay at sofitel and definately the last one."
"We are currently staying here. Room 141. Do not be fooled by the glossy website. This is far from 5 star standard but 5 star prices. A crucial factor needed in such heat is effective aircon. This does not exist. Despite repeated requests for this to be addressed, we lost the first 2 days of our holiday trying to sort this out. We were offered different rooms with loss of view or facing a concrete wall or move next door to a sterile none atmospheric minimalist hotel. Why would we do that in Morocco when we chose this one to experience the Moroccan style? We already paid for an upgrade before arriving for what turned out to b a very substandard room. How many more upgrades do we need to pay for to get decent air conditioning?  Total misrepresentation of standards.   Solution was for Management to shrug shoulders in the end. They are not concerned we have barely slept for three nights. Our recommendation is you do not book this hotel but try the RUI Palace Tikida. Better location too"
"I am disappointed with the service at this hotel. From the moment we walked in, it was clearly visible that the service at reception was poor, the staff namely Fatim Zohra was unbelievably rude once asked why the rooms were taking so long to get ready, we waited over an hour in reception. Other staff in reception named Salah was asked to change £1150 in sterling to local currency and he only counted £950. I had my bank manager friend count it out for him and he stood back with his arms folded arrogantly, when asked if he was happy when £1150 was counted he responded with ""are you happy"". I couldn't understand how he could make such a mistake? Was he trying to deceive me? service by the pool was virtually non existent. Everything just took to long. Came here with high expectations, I am very disappointed. I hope this hotel and its senior staff take heed of this complaint/review."
"I'm staying here now as I write this review.
I am here with my four children, x2 teens X1 6yr old and a 2yr old.
Poor service waiting for ages to be served, sometimes 40mins for a glass of wine.
Ants in the room. Cracks in the floor around the pool. A children's day care that you don't know is there, no one comes round telling the children play or inviting them to see what they do.
Reception really badly managed, no instruction on basic information when we arrived, like breakfast times etc.
This is definitely NOT 5 star at all. 
If 5 star for you is.....
Poor service
Long service
Badly managed
Ants in the room
No power shower
Then this is for you.....I personally like excellent service, showers and no ants at my 5star hotels!
Shockingly expensive £12 for a pizza and £7 for a glass of wine
Breakfast excellent.......loads of choice best part of the stay so far.

I booked with On The Beach.....that's also been a big problem. The hotel did not in any way help us sort out the problem we had when we arrived. We arrived to be told we only had one too, booked. The hotel told us to sort it out. I think the 5star hotels I've stayed at before would have helped enormously, not just sent us away to make the calls, take our bags and have no access to any rooms for hours!
Terrible service from the hotel and from On The Beach. We feel very let down.
On the beach.......terrible (apart form Leah) have been appalling. We spent.....sorry we wasted 6 hours of our holiday trying to get on the beach to confirm we In fact did have x2rooms. Horrid waste of our time which was never our fault or doing. Nobody has compensate us for the call to U.K or any other gesture for the waste of our holiday spent on trying to confirm something that is not our doing.
Did not at any point see a manager to ask if we were ok.....nothing!
Nothing for kids to do at all

Back ground info......I am well travelled worked in Afirca in orphanages and I have worked for a well known British Airline...I'm well trained in excellent customer service. I speak fluent French."
"We  arrived at this hotel 2nights ago to find that the room that we booked was not available we were upgraded the next night and given a free meal. Tonight we have been unable toseep because of a function in an outside tent in the grounds and no matter how many times we ask the noise continues. It is now midnight and we cannot sleep and not one person on the staff has tried to help...indeed reception are not answering our call and even after I went to the reception desk in my dressing gown they have ignored me. 

Please avoid this hotel at all costs......"
"we visited here to have a celebration lunch as I knew they served wine and champagne.  On arrival - and bearing in mind there were only three other loungers occupied it tick me going to the bar were 5 staff were lounging about to get us coffees.  Our hot chocolate was watery milk with chocolate powder sprinkled on top. YUKKK for 6 euro!  Coffee was nearly cold.  
We swam in the pool and were shouted at that we had to pay.  No discretion or consideration that shouting at guests across a pool is not pleasant!
After this we decided that we had made so unwelcome that we no longer wanted to lunch there.  I spoke to the food and beverage manager before we left to say how disappointed we were with the customer service they deem acceptable. He didn't seem to think it was an issue.  Had the hotel been busy I could maybe understand that they didn't want non residents but as there were only a max of half a dozen other people around the pool when we left I find this type of attitude puzzling to say the least.
We went to the hotel next door Palais de Roses which wasn't trying to be as posh but was totally different.  Welcoming and friendly."
"They see a tourist and just want to ripp them off rooms are dirty don't recommend at all to anyone stay well away. That was the first and last dirty place and there all liars in this hotel they just after your money"
"I don't normally do reviews but feel so strongly about this place I just want to assist others to make an informed decision.
Pro's. 
Staff excellent virtually to a man (woman) very polite & helpful. Food at breakfast was decent quality but a bit samey after a few days.
Con's.
Hotel is extremely dated, outside area's kept very well (clean) but overall well past it's sell by date. Not even Coffee/Tea making facilities in the rooms (you get that in a Blackpool B&B for heavens sake). Most of the rooms do NOT have a balcony regardless of if they have a sea or garden view, makes the room very prison cell like. Again kept clean but there is only so much the staff can do (silk purse - sows ear).
We tried B&B for a change having done all inclusive for the last few years, maybe that is why it seemed VERY expensive to eat/snack in the Hotel itself. Still think that £4 for a (mediocre)coffee is extortionate, you could have a bun with it for an extra £4 !!!!!
Entertainment could best be described as non existant, we suffered poor weather for a few days and there was nothing to do around the hotel to pass the time unless you could get on the Ping Pong table & like to play that ? Forget the evening stuff.
Now the real killer - LOCATION.
Supposed to be a short stroll to the Marina, it's actually more that 5Km !! You are right at the other end of the promenade & it took us well over an hour to walk down to the Marina where most of the eateries are located. Nearest small group of restaurants are a good 25 min walk away. Even getting a Taxi down (which is not expensive) gets tedious mainly due to the fact that they know the fare is 30Dir but insist on asking 40, you then have to haggle to get to 30, this is OK the first couple of times but when you have to do it with the same driver over & over it gets on your wick !!!
Must say that we did enjoy some very nice meals at a reasonable price (about 50% of what the hotel wanted) but if you are a wine drinker be prepared to pay a lot of money for average wine.
Don't know the reason for the high wine price but it seemed to be the same everywhere we went & it was roughly £15-20 a bottle for what you can get in ASDA for about £4.
Had this Hotel been more honestly rated by the tour operator (Thompson) I would'nt feel so agrieved but when you pay 5* money you at least expect an attempt at that rating, this fell way short."
"service terrible, rooms smelly, pictures of the hotel gives you a different impression. if I am obliged to write 200 characters would be to say again a never again experience. What else to say? I will never recommend this place.
      
      
      "
"The Hotel itself is lovely, the staff were friendly but the service was poor.
I found that because many of the people who looked at us thought we were Moroccan we weren't getting the same service as some of their French or English guests. Every morning at Breakfast we got the hellos and hi's unfortunately unlike the other guests being offered drinks we had to ask for ours as well as cultery & napkins! Twice we were offered Tea and forgotten about. 
I was glad that we didn't book all inclusive at the Hotel and enjoyed our evenings out.
The hotel is full of snobby guests that are rude. The entertainment at the Hotel was good on an evening and they also had a nightclub in the hotel that played good music but expensive drinks. 
I don't think I'll be staying here again."
"Our 2 week stay at this hotel were a stay of 2 halfs - one good and one absolutely terrible.  We stayed in February this year and being absolutely honest I've waited until the cool light of day before writing this review.  The luxury element of this was mis-sold to me at time of booking.

Week one - The good bits.
The Pool Staff - friendly and helpful.  Karim the restaurant manager truely understanding of what makes a 5 star hotel click.  The concierge Aziz - knowledgeable helpful brilliant. 
Rooms ok but a bit disappointing if I'm honest for a 5 star hotel.  Our window ledge was bunged up with discarded cigarette butts (still trying to figure out why anyone would do that and more why the cleaner would actually leave it in place).  Bathroom floor and wall next to toilet not very clean but as a previous reviewer said and I repeat - we had a new and exciting animal or object made from towels and rose petals on our bed each night.

Week 2 coincided with French School Half term and the hotel changed into a kindergarten of wild and wilful small children who were out of control at all hours of the day and night.  They rampaged through corridors, in restaurants, handled food at the buffet I could go on but I am boring myself.  I did feel sorry for the hotel staff as the issue lay with more the lack of control of the parents and the parental need to consume vast quantities of alcohol.  Each night during this week we were awoken by noisy feet and squealing kids.  We complained.  Wasted our time etc. We hated the hotel at this stage so much we really wanted to leave.  The staff to whom we complained were lovely but I do understand were powerless.  How do you ask maman to control her little darlings???
HOWEVER I do say this (to Sofitel) - if you promote yourself as a boutique 5 star spa hotel the innocent unknowing customer automatically assumes as we did that we were entering into a tranquil realm unspoilt by noise or chaos.  We wanted somewhere that was civilized where we could relax by the pool and the noise would come from the turn of a page or the dropping of a leaf! The hotel should be either cater to package holiday kids vacations  or a place for adults who have paid through the nose for peace and quiet.

Another small and irritating event was the attitude and poor service offered by reception staff.  When changing UK money to Dirhams they made a great display of checking the notes holding them to the light and checking that the ink was dry on them.  It made me feel like I was complete scum and their insinuation I was trying to rip them off.  When I tried to change money one night and the ""reception lady"" had the audacity to check my money again after her colleague had already done so I had just about had enough and took my money back of her.   My husband and I called this the Moroccan Money Changing Ceremony.

One other word of warning that on check in they hold about EUR 130 per day for your stay on a credit card so you need to make sure before you stay here that your credit card will be accepted in Morocco and that you have enough balance on it for your stay.  I have never EVER had this happen before.

Sofitel if you really want your name to be connected with Luxury and service you need to relook at how you promote your hotel and re-train your reception staff they are, after all your representatives."
"We stayed for three nights at the resort. Overall it was just ok (unmotivated staff, poor English skills, super cold pool water). The check out at this resort was just the worst I've ever experienced. The lady at the reception was super rude. 
"
"This is the worst SOFITEL I have ever stayed in !!! I stayed at this hotel for the ""Trophee Hassan II"" golf tournament as they were the ""official"" luxury hotel. The rooms are antiquated, albeit the beds are comfortable. The is a 1 star hotel at best, the food in the restaurants is bland and expensive and the service is pathetic. The hotel smells of damp and sewerage...a totally irrelevant attempt to embrace Moroccan culture with 5 star service (and prices) !!! Not much else to say except this is a 'lazy"" attempt at hospitality...DREADFUL !!!"
"Our final stop in our fifteen days traveling throughout Morocco.  The service was extremely poor except for the bellboys and some of the restaurant staff !  The front office was not helpful in resolving air conditioning and room issues?  The first room we had was filthy as was the hallway.  The air conditioning never worked properly in either of our two rooms.  God help us if it was unseasonable hot !  The breakfast was good but eating on site was extremely expensive for the quality of the food.  The front office staff was not helpful, inefficient, non engaging and cold.  When comparing this hotel experience with other riad/hotel experience throughout the country, it was a huge dissapointment.  None of the warmth we experienced elsewhere.  The common areas, pool and grounds were nice. Overpriced for the product you receive.  A 3 star hotel at 5 star prices.  Would never stay here again."
"This was our second Christmas here and last . Had a ghastly time at night with French guests partying in their rooms till all hours ,scraping furniture up and down .
The previous year our bed had been fantastic - a sight to behold , specially made up of huge duvets and.... they even gave you a booklet so you could buy things and copy it at home , fantastic ! ..this year ..no such luck - a single duvet under a bedspread ,the wardrobe looked suspiciously B&Qish too . The air-con was totally useless.
The most cohesive part of the day is breakfast - all hands on deck - and it seems to work well and there is a good choice.
The So restaurant is very average at an extortionate price and the Asian restaurant just not terribly good .
As mentioned before the reception staff seem to be an ignorant bunch , when the atm failed to work , the chap suggested it was our cards at fault and he even pretended to phone the bank in front of us. We were later told the machine had been broke for some while !!
No, no, no just cant stay here again - shame , most of the staff are so friendly."
"Stayed at this hotel for a new year break, very disappointed not the usual five star, especially the reception staff who we thought were very ignorant and only wanted to speak if you could speak french. So take this into account when booking, the food is ok, drinks very expensive, "
"They try so hard and endeavour to be the best with their rather tacky panache and crass attempts at client liaison but this is in reality a rather boring, yawny hotel without true warmth and homeliness in a lousy town and would only be recommended for a couple of days with the family (the pool is fabulous) or a night on a business trip through necessity. Still, it outshines Agadir as a whole, which is grim and the hotel has a nice reception/ bar area and does serve alcohol which is a blessed relief. The hotel is quite a way from the town, but then there is little to see and do anyway and the hassle factor from some.locals in some places is a pain, although not quite so bad as previously."
"Now you might be wondering why 1 star and title VERY ELEGANT. Let me explain,

This is a very nice hotel, Sofitel lives up to its name, but you will need a very deep pocket to stay here.

At first was when I arrived in the hotel was greeted by the door staff, thumbs up, but as soon as I entered the lobby I was greeted by lots of people setting the lobby area where the entertain is live every night who was smoking, not a good sight, I had to rush to the reception area, which is on the other side, there was some mistake with my booking, this was recovered and I was told were the lift was, not even taken to my room, which I had to work this out for myself, not what you expect from a 5 start hotel.

On arrival to the room, this was very nice and clean, the TV was not working, I called reception and no one turned up. Left this to the morning.

Dinner for 2 will set you back £50-£60 pounds, not worth what you pay for, this is available a few mins walk from the hotel for half the price.

Got to say the kids club is great, your child will love this, and the staffs are great. Room cleaning staff are the best, very happy and polite.

From a resort you will expect some compliments, but in this one you will have to pay for everything, I mean everything, just take an extra £1000 for an 8 night stay.

Pool was OK but the main pool was very cold, like ice was frown in to the pool, even the sea water was warm.

The pool area, all the beds get occupied early morning, but after 10AM no one is on the beds only towels, you will need to request a bed and wait for half hour before you are allocated a bed by the pool.

Breakfast is dull for what you pay for.

Entertainment is OK, but 1 night every week they go out the way to entertain you, every Monday night.

Some may like this, but for me it is a NO"
"We have just spent a week in this hotel and I hope this review will ensure you know what to expect of this Sofitel. It would struggle to rate a 3 Star.
There is one overriding and very simple reason for this. The bedrooms are attrocious!!! 
Apart from the drastic lack of lighting the quality of the bathroom and the beds is terrible. The bathroom is set inside the bedroom divided only by a full wall of slightly opaque window with no shuttering. The consequences of this are that the person in the bedroom is presented with every function of the person in the toilet/bathroom. To add to this the glass window runs the length of the bath/shower and I hate to think of the consequences of a slip or fall whilst in the bath/shower against the wall of glass. Having a full length wall made of glass also means that if anyone goes to the toilet/bathroom during the night you are not only privy to the back-lit perfomance but the whole of the bedroom is illuminated by the bathroom lighting.
However the worst thing by far is the beds. I have NEVER been in a hotel with such poor quality beds. The twin beds are incredibly narrow, to the extent that you fall out when turning over. This narrowness is not helped by the fact that housekeeping insert a double duvet, rolled up under the base sheet making the bed basically a narrow dome!!
It was IMPOSSIBLE to sleep during the whole of our stay.
The staff are exceptional and faultless and I can't give them all enough thanks - with the noteable exception of reception which is a very poorly run operation. Upon arrival we were asked to wait 45 minutes in the lounge area whilst they made a room ready for us. Now the web site for the hotel is rubbish and information scarce so I don't know what time check in is, however we were collected by their driver and arrived at the hotel at 12.45 - so I thought that they may know we were coming.......Once uncomfortably waiting at reception we started to discover just how slow and poorly manned that facility is and all future visits to reception during our stay involved very long and arduous queuing and waiting. Really really long wating.......
The pool area is great and highly recommended.
The restaurant is sadly over run by children and the staff are too polite to ask the parents to get their children off the scooters and stop running around.
Which is a good reminder to say that this hotel is definitely NOT for couples. It is however for children.
Agadir itself is pleasant. Located 6 kilometers from the hotel it is reached using the ancient Petit Taxis that are readily available. Shopping is limited to the usual tourist gimmicks. Restaurants outside of the tourist promenade are scarce."
"I recently stayed in this hotel and can't say I enjoyed it. We stayed on a bed and breakfast and found anything we bought in the hotel rather expensive. This was a problem as the hotel is a long way from anywhere else to eat. Any trip into the centre of Agadir requires a taxi ride and this brings its own problems. On one occasion we had an argument with a driver who tried to change the price  after we had agreed it and insisted on taking us to the wrong restuarant  and didn't like it when we complained when we started to take his number he jumped in his taxi and drove away.Another problem was the items on the bill we hadn't had and when I changed money I was short changed and then told it was a mistake when Iqueried it. This happened frequently in Morroco and was always claimed to be a mistake.On the plus side the hotel was comfortable and the beach was nice .However I felt the negatives outweighed the positives and won't be going back."
"I have just returned from a stay at the Sofitel Bay Resort and have mixed feelings. This is no 5 star hotel, I would say more 4 star. The service generally I would say is of below standard, especially at reception. The breakfast although good, service again poor. There were  some people who were polite and helpful but very inconsistent. This however did not spoil our holiday. The rooms are of a good standard but a little worn out in places. There are no tea and coffee facilities in the room which means you have to pay high prices for this at the hotel. We really enjoyed the Hamam treatment followed by the argan oil massage. I would also encourage you to check your bill, I picked this up from other comments and the same happened to us. The biggest disappointment was when we went to use the spa at their sister hotel, the Sofital Thalassa. The facial I had was not to the standard I would expect especially given the prices charged, and we were given some wrong information about one of the treatments which meant we lost out on one treatment. Despite complaining to the general manager who did acknowledge our concerns but when this was communicated to the Spa Manager a Madame Najma, she was just dismissive of our complaint and to my amazement said that she was too busy to deal with our complaint which is why she didn't repond to our request. There was no follow up and closure which meant we left very dissatisfied. The score for the spa given is based at the Bay Resort, if I had to score the Thalassa then this would be scored as poor"
"We stayed here last year and it was the worst hotel experience ever! In fact I wrote a review when I got back which seems to have disappeared.

The service was horrendous, the room smelt of dam, the food was awful and worst of all, they forged my signature on some receipts! I have since complained and been compensated but would never recommend this hotel to anyone."
"We had booked our stay in Agadir at the Sofitel RoyalBay Resort. Despite the fact that we did not spent a lot of time there, here is our review.

The hotel is made in the pure Moroccan tradition ; public areas are fine with nice decoration. The hotel offers different restaurants, from pool bar to more ‘gastronomic’ place.

The room we had booked was a Deluxe room, with a balcony. We were, however, very deceived by the room : it was not very clean, and it looks horribly ‘old’ … The Wi-Fi connection was absent (you need to go out of the room to grab a weak connection), the balcony was just in front of the kids’ pool (so very noisy) and not very ‘fresh’ and the furniture on the room (except the flat TV which looks in this context anachronical) were passed and old.

Based on those observations, we asked to be transferred next door, this is to the Sofitel Agadir Thalassa Sea & Spa. The transfer was easy, and we were warmly welcomed to the place. However, when leaving, no-one asked us why we were leaving so quickly (meaning 2 hours after our arrival). This was surprising to us.

To our opinion, this hotel doesn’t deserve the Sofitel brand ; it should be rebranded as a Mercure one or something similar. If the public areas and facilities are great, rooms are not fitting anymore to the (new) Sofitel quality standards (and we know the brand by staying in Sofitel hotels regularly). If we understand that the Accor Group wants to keep the connection with the Sofitel Thalassa Sea & Spa next door, we also think that this Sofitel RoyalBay looks, comparably, ‘low cost’ and damage the Sofitel brand – especially the luxury and exclusive aspect of the brand.

We rate the hotel ‘below average’ for that reason."
"First I want to say that I have come to this hotel every year for the past five years - but after this year I will never return. Something has happened since last year and I think it is management caused. So to begin - I always reserve a car to pick my wife and I up. There was no one at the airport. The check-in took 30 minutes. We asked for a room not over the children's room - that is exactly where they put us. After 17h00 there were no towels at the pool, at the beach the service was terrible - Everyone is very nice however. We ordered breakfast in the room - both in French and English over a period of five days- not once was it correct. The toilets didn't work - the shower was broken (this a prestige suite) - I got sick from eating at the hotel restaurant. And every time we have stayed this happens - please check your bill upon departure - they have always added some restaurant bill which wasn't ours - This has happened every time, I first thought it was a mistake but now I am skeptical - after five times. Last by not least in my evaluation I mentioned all this and they replied and they didn't even get my name or sex correct. Complete lack of management and so disappointing for a Sofitel. Never again !!!"
"I would not recommend this hotel. The hotel grounds are amazing shame pool staff are thieves. Day before we checked out we found that our pool was a little high. We asked for the original receipts that we signed mainly for food around pool area. We were horrified to find out that our signatures had been forged. Turned out my cousin and her friend who were paying cash for their food the pool guys were probable pocketing their money and making new receipts in mine and my sisters name and putting our cousins food items on our room. Food was poor so we survived on chips and ice creams for 3 day trip. Service was very poor expect to wait an hour for a drink in reception bar if staff ever come over to you. Standard rooms are dirty and air con didn’t work and shower had no screen or curtain so water collected on bathroom floor and whole room smelt damp. Whole room was very dirty. We complained and got upgraded room which was far cleaner and better. Agadir is awful place would never recommend to anyone."
"We stayed at this hotel for a week and the experience was pretty much mixed. First of all the hotel was quite nice when we first arrived, the lobby was big and clean and they welcomed us with the local Moroccan tea and some local biscuits. 

Then we went to the deluxe sea view room we have requested for. The view was lovely as you look out to the pool and the beach but the room was very old. Lots of bits need to be worked on like the shower, air conditioning, windows, bathroom and etc. 

During our stay we had some issues with our air conditioning and we had to remind them every single day for 4 days before we can get someone to come up to have a look. That was extremely disappointing especially from a five star hotel. The service was definitely the weakest point of the hotel as you often have to wait for AGES before you can get a service even though you can see the staff members are just standing there and chatting rather than looking around to see if anyone needs service. Not surprised with some of the previous comments were saying how bad the service was.

One thing that really bugs me was the hotel manager would front up and go to TripAdvisor to respond to those “awful reviews”. I would have much more respects for him if he does, doesn’t matter if the reviews were good or bad.

This resort was nice but it was let down by the level of service we have received during our stay. I would definitely not be returning to this resort and very disappointing at the Sofitel brand."
"We booked the hotel for the first part of our honeymoon. On the web-form, we chose to upgrade to the ""ocean-view"". Once there, what a disappointment!
1- There was actually no ""ocean-view"" rooms as the hotel is U shaped and not exactly ON THE BEACH (roomswise). And we had no balcony! So you need to jump over a sofa and open a high window to be able to see outside!
2- The room was dusty. It seems like the cleaning was done superficially.
3- The bed was so uncomfortable and had a major bump in it, not the type of bed you'd like to share in your honeymoon. Plus I was surprised we didn't have the typical Sofitel beds I experienced abroad.
4 - The TV was SO OLD! Like the big grey machines that were replaced everywhere else by flatscreens...I was surprised to find this type of TVs in a Sofitel room!
5- It was winter, so no swimming. The -very nice- area the hotel has on the beach was not well taken care of. We actually didn't find a single chair to sit in and just look at the ocean.
6 - We had dinner at the SO restaurant. We were basically the only clients. In the middle of our dinner, a group of men arrived, stood next to us for 5 long minutes speaking SO LOUD! Then we realized it, after asking the waiters, that it was the restaurant's MANAGER, a very rude French man, planning a business dinner with businessmen. Man, if you want to do business, respect your customers first!

Aside from this, the pool is huge and very nice. The food is great at the hotel. But to pay almost 500$ a night for this is being a fool. It was at the highest a 3-star hotel."
"Lets start with the good things.....the location more or less direct on Agadir beach...Fantastic!
The bed in the bedroom...Super!

But then comes all the rest!
Negativ, negativ, negativ...!
I never stayed in a hotel with so many unservice minded employes!
I can give 100 of exampels of pure rudeness that I experienced during my 4 days at the hotel.
From receptionists to restaurant employes...ohhh..just horrible!
If you feel so unwelcomed, the seaview, the nice bed and the clean room are of less importance....well it actually of no value at all!
I am absolotely sure that, after those 4 days, I will never, ever stay at any Sofitel again!

"
"this sofitel does not deserve its name! you arrive at reception, they sit you down forcefully for check in which lasted half an hour, then they give you your keys without even telling you where the lifts are!
you get to your room without heating with temperature at night well below 10!!!!
the curtains/shades to block the light were rotten! you had to wash your hands everytime u touched them
it takes at least 2 hours to eat 3 very samll sushi and maki at lunchtime for a fortune! no money has been spend fro the pas 20 years on the equipment outdoor! everything is rotten!

unbelievable!!!!!!!!!have never seen that in a sofitel! have been to many and never disappointed! but this one should be scrapped!"
"It is not my first time staying at a sofitel hotel and I always had a good impression.. Until I had stayed at sofitel agadir.. The staff - not helpful , and I mean the receptionists and the managers..

It's almost a month since I left agadir and not even now I got my deposit back... I spoke with several people there and on top of not being very helpful, they also lied about the money that the hotel took from my bank account...

Last person that I spoke with was one of the managers there and he said to me that I didn't pay any deposit.. I have the receipt that they gave me after I paid and also my bank statement that sofitel took the money as proof... 

The deposit is still not refunded so I will probably need to speak with a representative of sofitel chain that doesn't work for sofitel agadir... 

I never met such rude staff before, and especially after speaking with that manager I don't think I will ever go back to stay at sofitel..

My advice is really be careful with what you pay and keep your receipts, in case it will happen to you as well.

Laura, London"
"I recently sent them an email about a forthcoming stay and they never bothered to reply. Slightly concerned that there is obviously no quality control from the sofitel group."
"The rooms had a horrid smell at night, the hotel is looking old and tired. Not maintained well at all. Restaurant manager was rude and unhelpful. The general manager can't even be bothered to contact me. Alexandre is a top guy and looked after me well. Without him I did not really have a good word to say about this poorly designed place."
"I am currently staying here as of July, 2011. I have stayed in other Morrocan Sofitels and this is by far the worst. My 5 night stay is summarized by this
a) Screaming kids the entire time -- I couldn't even take a nap either from the kids screaming in the pool or hallway. There were spoiled rats everywhere
b) paying 50MAD for a glass of orange juice - a better glass you can get for 4MAD in the square in Marrakesh
c) An air conditioner I couldn't control - it was on full blast the entire time no matter how it was set
d) The beds didn't even have sheets. Just a comforter
e) The wireless internet service is garbage at best in the guest rooms
f) The ocean isn't really viewable from any room that I could tell - no balconies either
g) The maid service opened my door even when the 'do not disturb' sign was on the door. Even when their written policy in the hotel guide says they won't do that, but will call at 3p. They never called. 
h) The buffet was mediocre at best and overpriced

I've traveled many places and been in many resort and ocean front hotels. This is by far the worst I've been in because of the premium you're paying for the room even in the off-season. The main lobby area and pool/beach areas are gorgeous. But, details matter, amenities matter, value matters, privacy matters, peace and quiet matters -- Sofitel Agadir fails on all of these."
"The swiming pools and beach facilities are excellent and the courtesy of staff is eye catching. But on the down side, the hotel has many serious problems. In practice, they charge you for everything, except for breathing which is gratis! Food and beverage, in particular, are unreasonably expensive. A print of a single photo costs around 10 Euros and using the PC to connect to Internet costs you 30 Euro per day! Bills are confusing as tax is also shown along with the price. Of course, the client is only interested in the total amount and the tax should only be a concern of the hotel."
"Apart from prices, which are apalling, this is just not a 5 star hotel. Don't get me wrong, it's not an Ibis, but it's far from a really high end hotel particularly in terms of services. If you work hard and want value for money, stay away.  I don't mind paying Eur 6 for a glass of juice or EUR 3 for a small coffee, but when the coffee is bad, the reception people don't speak english, the toilets overflow, I call that a poor all in all package."
"Considering this is suppose to be the best hotel in town, it leaves a lot to be desired.  Its overpriceed, the customer service is awful and the food is just about OK.  The outside areas on the surface look very nice, with lots of comfy seating, hammocks etc., but on closer inspection this hotel needs an overhaul.  The tiles are chipped in and around the pool and it generally looks like it needs some tender loving care.

I cannot understand why most of the rooms do not have balconies, especially as most of them face the sea.

But the worse thing about the hotel is the customer service.....you ask for something, they smile politely, but you don;t get what you asked for.  We asked several times over the course of a few days for tumbler type glasses for the bedroom and eventually went to the bar downstairs and got them there.  They seem to have their priorities out of order, chambermaid keen to scatter rose petals on the floor and bed, but sometimes failed to bring clean towels.  They boast they have a turn down service, it never happened.  Not that we wanted the chocolate on the pillow, but we did want a change of towels in an evening.

All in all, we felt like we'd stayed at a 3-4 star hotel.....very disppointing."
"rooms are extremely small, service is poor, and food selection in limited"
"This hotel is the pits, dont even go there.The first night we all eat in the hotel, Its cost £100.oo for two adults and one child to have a buffet meal,no wine just soft drinks.

During the night we were all very very ill, this was reported to Thompson and the reception.

The rooms are not five star, we had two double room, my daughter is fifteen they gave her a cot bed in her room,the hotel said they had no other bed s and we would have to use that (dont think so) when we had paid for two double rooms.
In a nut shell, we all wanted to come home, i could go on and on.

 FIVE STAR PRICES FOR A THREE STAR HOTEL. Thats the top and bottom of it.
Every day we had to keep on and on to reception about something or other.
When you go on holiday you expect a holiday.
Our advise, BOOK SOME WHERE ELSE."
"After spending 3 nights in the Sofitel Marrakech we where excited about our move to the Sofitel Agadir.   I can't believe these two hotels are part of the same group, Marrakech is beautiful, stylish, 100% 5 star luxury, the food is excellent and definitely   a la carte, customer care is fantastic.  Softel Agadir is a beautiful hotel and could be 5 star if it was properly managed, the staff went on customer service training and the restaurant adhered to some sort of food hygiene guidelines, possibly serving the same food as Marrakech.    I would grade this hotel as 3/4 star.

We arrived at 3:30pm at the hotel and had to wait another hour before our rooms where ready,   we had booked two deluxe double rooms (we deliberately paid for two doubles even though one of the rooms would only have one person staying in it).  When we where shown our rooms they where both standard quality and one had a single child’s bed.    I contacted reception and explained the mix up, they said unfortunately all other rooms at the hotel where taken.     I then contacted our tour operator for assistance,   after another two hours of discussion, and us planning a move to another hotel,   suddenly two double deluxe rooms where available.     In hindsight we should have taken the opportunity to move.    

Breakfast was buffet style nothing special (not what we have experienced in other 4 or 5 star hotels).    Dinner was offered in either a restaurant or the buffet,   the restaurant was horrendously expensive (a cheap bottle of wine started at £20 and a half decent on about £35).  The food was not served piping hot and not particularly well presented.    The buffet food was kept warm, again not hot,   and ran out as the evening progressed.     All three of us are seasoned travellers and take care to only ever drink bottled water but we all became ill at this hotel, we spoke to other guests and found they suffered in the same way. 

I would not recommend this hotel.   Before I booked this hotel I read the reviews on Tripadvisor and decided to take a chance as there were as many good reviews as bad ones.  Unfortunately I should have taken notice of the bad ones."
"I had to stay for almost 8 months in this hotel because I was on business trip in Morocco, have to say I didn't like it at all, the service is very poor, the food is below average and the staff are far from friendly, I don't recommend it even if it was for free"
"We, from Amsterdam, booked a room trough internet. It was rather expencive, but why not. It was at the end of our tip through Morocco. We stayed in the most beautifull riads all over the country. 
The room was very small, no balcony, only a small window. It looked as a total not trendy or ""design"". It looked very run down. We left the hotel as soon as possible. Our advise: Don't go there!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THIS IS A TOURIST TRAP!!!!!"
"5-star? Give me a break! In first world countries with decent competition, this would be a 3 star at best. The service is diabolical, the F&B average, rooms are OK but overything is overpriced. There is little wrong with the buildings and facilities themselves, but the place lacks a GM with international experience and the ability to train staff to deliver decent international-standard hospitality service. Having to buy scratch cards for internet access vouchers is as daft and outdated an idea as I've come across in a supposedly premium hotel After enduring a number of shocking stays, I gravitated across the road to the Timoulay Hotel (a fraction of the cost, with the same service problems but at least delivered with a smile). I resolved to never set foot in the Sofitel again and am happy to report I have not."
"Absolutely not a 5 star hotel. Poor service and dirty breakfast restaurant.
Very small rooms ( even the higher priced rooms). Poor staff and management.
The atmoshphere around the pool is nice, but we have waited, waited and waited for any service during the whole week. Poor internet connection. We never had such a poor service in any hotel.....overall BAD !"
"Having recently stayed here for what I hoped would be a relaxing break we left thinking every single person employed here was either stupid or just totally incompetent. There is absolutely the hotel would get a 5 star rating in a developed country with its current management in place.

The room I had was ok. Nice size, not much of a view but that would not be a problem for me as I didn't go to Agadir to sit in the room. We did often get a bad smell when walking down the corridor to the room though which I could only think was the drains.

The bars and restaurants were totally lacking in atmosphere. We generally had a few drinks before heading out and on all occasions we had to walk up to the bar to get staffs attention despite there being at least 4 of them behind the small bar and only a handful of other tables occupied. The drinks are way over priced, competing with London hotel prices when you can get a drink 10 mins away for about 1/3 of the price in a bar/restaurant with a bit of atmosphere. The breakfast was nowhere near worth the €25 they charge. As mentioned by another reviewer the only fresh and hot things you an get are eggs and pancakes. We had lunch one day in the poolside restaurant and agaiin the staff let it down. It took them about 10 minutes to bring us a menu despite there being 6 of them working and only one other couple in the restaurant. It was then a struggle to get condements from them an also took about 5 minutes of trying to catch one of their attention to get the bill.

On one of the day threr I wound up being sent on a wild goose chase by the conciege desk  when I simply enquired about the location of somewhere to buy bus tickets. In the end after wasting half a day trying to find a ticket office which did not exist while following directions given to me by the concierges on an out of date map provided by the hotel I had to give up. After expressing my disappointment to the Head of Guest Relations at the hotel I was assured that they would help the following day but not surprisingly they didn't come to me but I had to initiate the exchange. Then, having been told they would get back to me immediately once sorted out, I found myself having to approach the desk again to assess progress. This time I was informed that they had failed in what they were trying to book for me yet didn't have the manners to inform me or to refund me the money which I had provided up front to the concierge. 

All in all a brutally disappointing stay at what could be a great hotel if it was managed properly."
"stayed at Sofitel for the first time Oct 11th for one week.

The Hotel itself is very nice.  The room we had I would say was average.

The service I have to say was appalling.  Starting with breakfast,  we had to ask so many times to try and get somebody to clear the table and bring us tea/coffee.  Eventually I asked the Manager could we have some service and he looked at me blankly.  So many staff running around and yet you could not get any service.  For a five start hotel I found this incredible.

Lunch we had by the pool every day.  Again the service was appalling.  There is no proper management here.  All the managers seem to do is berate the staff on front of patrons.  There is no organisation at breakfast or lunch.

The reception staff look very sad and uninterested.  When we checked out nobody asked us did we enjoy our stay.  They would not appear to be very happy in their jobs.

On our first night we went into the Piano bar for a pre dinner drink again here the service was very poor.  We had to ask for some nuts there was no atmosphere here at all.

This was our 5th time in Morocco.  Previously we stayed at the Atlantic Palace Hotel.  It was fantastic in every way.

We would not go back to the Sofitel.  Such a pity because the Hotel itself is fabulous and being able to walk onto the beach and relax on the goregous beds was a real treat.

The staff need to be motivated and the service really needs attention.  Nobody should have to ask for service in a five star hotel and there certainly was no shortage of staff and yet the service was appalling."
"We were expecting great things from this hotel but sadly that was not the case. The key to a great hotel are the people who work there and here the Staff very unmotivated, souless atmosphere, customers were frequently ignored especially at breakfast which was a disaster, badly organised. It was not uncommon to sit at a dirty table for 10 minutes. When we checked out we were not even thanked or asked if we had enjoyed ourselves. That is very poor for a hotel that boasts five stars and is expensive. staff were berated infront of customers, basically there was no effective management. To be fair some of the staff did try but they were sadly in the vast minority.

the only positives we can give are that it has a beautiful location 
on the beach and it was clean. Try the atlantic beach instead, much much better. We do not expect miracles but would strongly avoid you to give the sofitel a wide berth. We discussed the hotel with other customers and they agreed with our view."
"Quite a nice product but probably more 4.5 star than really a 5 star, just a shame that the hotel industry only has these 5 levels although in Agadir there is 5* and 5* deluxe. The Sofitel is listed as 5* but what is most 5* about it is the price.

At first, when you arrive the mix of the modern with the Moroccan style is impressive, so is especially the pool (small) and around it the nice furniture.

The rooms are ok, with old TVs nice spacious beds and a bright bathroom....

For business travelers, careful, the internet is a rip off and there is other hotels like the Tekida Palace, probably the only real 5* in Agadir offering the www for free!

Breakfast is a nice choice of food but the presentation is at best 4 star, you have to run a marathon to collect your bits from the various buffets and then food is 'thrown' by hand on your plate from the chef i.e. the lady doing the crepes with her ugly oily fingers....

Worst of all is 'value for money', hotels in Morocco tend to be a rip off. EUR 170-200 for such a product is simply not fair especially if you're charged bits like internet at horrendous prices on top of it."
"We stayed at this hotel in middle of Feb 08.  The hotel is nice, feels very Morocan and the service was generally very good, but there were a few issues that stopped it justifying the five star rating.

The rooms were nice and generally clean, but as has been pointed out in a previous review none of the rooms have a balcony, although the ground floor rooms have a terrace.  This made our first floor room seem quite dark and you almost felt like you were in a cabin on a boat!  The toilet area - with no natural light was also quite dark.

The room itself was also ""tired"" - see attached pictures, worn paint, chipped sink, mildew growing around the shower and a shower curtain that if I were at home would have been replaced.

The corridors are also long and dark and for some reason around the main stairwell there was regularly a strong bleach/chemical smell.

We stayed on a B/B basis and the breakfast and snacks that we had were all satisfactory, although breakfast is a little spread out across three rooms i.e. omlettes in one room and toast two rooms away??!!!  Food and drink is also quite pricey - the equivalent for a pint of lager or glass of wine being £5 plus.

The pool area leading to the beach is nice and clean and has a good supply of comfortable sunbeds, hammocks etc.

Unfortunatley at the moment right next door to the hotel another hotel is currently being built.  Although not visible form most rooms or the pool area, as soon as you go towards the beach it is very obvious.  Generally along the beach itself, from the hotel towards Agadir (20-30 minute walk - currently the hotel furthest from the main town), there is a significant amount of construction work taking place as they develop a new promenade, this includes bulldozers etc. - not a quiet walk!"
"oct 2007
sofitel: the hotel overall was amazing with a great night club. room was not as expected as we asked for 3 beds & was only provided with 2. we asked the hotel staff if it was possible to change room but was told that there were none available, thus was only provided with a portable bed! 
the hotel staff were friendly, but when it came to sevice we wernt able to understand them as they spoke french, also the french that were staying at the hotel got better sevice. 

i personally would not choose to stay at the sofitel hotel again."
"There is no doubt that the Sofitel in Agadir is a fantastic hotel, the building, the setting, the furnishings are all fantastic and just as the photos on the website. However, the service is not as it should be in a five star hotel. 

We arived at 2am on Saturday, after a long and delayed flight; we were tired and the offer of a drink: coffee, mint tea, water, anything  would have been nice, however this was not forthcoming. The night manager sorted out our booking and took us to our room. Room No. 2 (Do not take this room!). 

The room was small and had twin beds, even though we had requested a double bed, the big frosted glass window on the shower had a large crack in it and the room overlooked a wall in front of a building site, otherwise it was fine. 

I called reception immediately and told them that we had specifically booked a room with a double bed and a  pool view as stated on our booking form, I was told that nothing could be done that night and that it would be sorted in the morning. I was less than impressed. The night manager arrived at our room to find out the problem, I repeated it, again he told us that nothing could be done until the morning. At this point the night manager told us that the hotel had overbooked the rooms so we could not change rooms that night. We were not happy. We asked if we could get some food and a drink, he gave us the room service menu and showed us the mini-bar. Moroccan hospitality is not impressing me thus far. However we ordered omelettes and a bottle of water from room service and waited and waited and waited. An hour later,(3.30am) after another telephone call our food and drink arrived. This was a sign of things to come.

The next morning after some discussion, I sorted out rooms with reception, and, in all fairness and after a word from our rep, they did upgrade our room to an ocean view room (Room 347) which was lovely although still not a double; at this point I couldn't be bothered to argue any longer and forgave the bed size for the view. However there was no apology or explanation.  

When you book a room here be really specific about its position and have your request in writing on your booking form. Of all the rooms about 40 have an ocean view, about 90 a pool view and a lot have a view of a wall or overlook the rooms of the hotel next door. I saw one room with a balcony that looked onto a rubbish heap (see photos) and another that faced a wall so be really careful. If you have booked a suite be aware that there is a lot of building work going on at the moment (January 2008) as the hotel is expanding, and the diggers and lorries are operating almost next door to the suites (see photos). 

OK , so we have a good room with a fantastic view and  we are happier people, even though it has taken half a day to sort out. I would say here that the beds are amazingly comfortable, I don't know the secret, but they are something else. It was a real struggle to get up in the morning or at any time!

Breakfast is a big buffet style affair, loads of choice, freshly squeezed orange juice, fruit, cheese, pastries etc. and generally very good, apart from spoons. For some reason it is really difficult to get a spoon, this was the same every day, and eating cereal with a fork is a bit tricky.

The poolside is superb, there are lots of big sunbeds as in the hotel publicity shots and finding one is not a problem. Likewise on the beach there are plenty of sunbeds, loungers and big comfortable chairs. The poolboys are always ready with towels and you can have as many as you like.

Then, as seems to be the way with this hotel, it all goes a bit pear shaped. I know that Morroccan service is slow, however at the Sofitel the waiters seem to forget. A coffee and a fruit juice took 45 minutes and arrived only after I went and found another waiter. The waiters by the pool seem to argue a lot; on one occasion I witnessed the restaurant manager physically pushing our waiter and then sending him away. As a result our order was delayed, then it arrived on the counter, was left to go cold, was recooked, then taken by another waiter for a walk around the pool trying to find us, even though we were sitting in front of them, before finally, again 45 minutes later, finding its way to our table. Once more no apology and no explantion.

I saw another guest become so frustrated with the level of service that he took a waiter by the arm and marched him to his table to take his order. I would point out here that Sofitel is a French company and some other guests that we spoke to suggested that the service was in keeping with other French run hotels that they had stayed at, so maybe it's just a difference in cultural expectation. It did seem that if you were French the service was better, but that could just be due to better communication as French is the first language amongst the staff.
 
Housekeeping was generally good, the place is spotless, however at 4.30pm on New Year's Eve a number of rooms, including ours, had not been made up. This was soon rectified, yet it is little things like this that I don't expect to have to deal with in a five star hotel. In addition our mini bar was not refilled once even though we requested it.

As has been mentioned several times in other reviews this hotel is expensive, and, as another reviewer has pointed out, this is to be expected in a five star hotel, however there is a difference between expensive and milking every last penny. This hotel gives nothing away. We booked in for the New Year Dinner, it cost us the equivalent of a similar event in London, therefore we were suprised to find that, after the complimentary glass of fizz, we were expected to pay for all drinks including water. We had hoped for at least a bottle of wine per couple and a free jug of water, but no. 

This is the thing with this hotel, money is king, everything that can be charged for is charged for. I'm not expecting charity, just a jug of water on the table. 

In summary then: the staff are very friendly, the concierge is excellent and very helpful. The whole place is spotlessly clean, the beds are as comfortable as you will ever find, the facilities are first class and the setting is almost dream like. However, service is very slow and the hotel prices are as you would expect to pay in London.

One other tip, if you are flying Royal Air Morrocco have your suicase bound in plastic at the airport as one of ours was ripped to shreds by the luggage handler on arrival and another had a zip broken upon return. Judging by people's reactions at the carousel this was not unusual."
"I booked this hotel following other reviews on this very website.
It was not cheap for the area, but I wrongfully presumed that it would be a luxurious haven for our special week away. How wrong could I be!!!

The hotel is tired, the carpets all over the place are covered in massive bleach stains, plaster is falling from the walls, the pool area is dangerous, the food is over priced and extremely poor in quality, the staff were something I had never come across before.

There were numerous incidents that occurred which made us want to leave this over priced, over hyped cess pit of a hotel.

I observed a waiter take the ice for some poor unsuspecting client from a previously used glass.
I ordered a bottle of wine from a waiter - 45 minutes later still no wine, we waited so long that we decided to have an early night, then the waiter literally grabs me and shouts at me ""WHAT ABOUT YOUR WINE, IT'S ON YOUR BILL NOW"" we didn't have the wine anyway.
We paid £50 for an oriental  1 course meal, that arrived cold even after the 50 minute wait (there were only 5 seated tables of diners).
The bed sheets were not changed once during our stay despite my requesting them to be changed on numerous occasions, as they still retained the mould stains on them from day 1.
Every day I had to ring up requesting replacement towels for our bathroom as the maid had taken the dirty ones but provided no replacements. 
My girlfriend picked up a nasty bug following breakfast one day - the next day we were first to breakfast, I requested some mineral water (which was usually on the buffet bar and was what my girlfriend dramk the day before). The waiter provided water in some mineral bottles that were overflowing, the water was warm and the seal on both bottles brought out were broken. Obviously to save costs they feel it necessary to poison the guests with the local water.
I asked the pool attendant for an extra towel one day he hissed at me and said ""YOU GIVE ME TIP OR NO TOWEL"" I gave him the equivalant to £1 in Dirham, he looked at me and said ""MORE"".
The final straw was on the last day at 630am we'd booked a private hotel car to the airport to catch our flight, when we got to reception they attempted to usher us onto a holiday company's airport coach, despite me having paid them 35 euros for the private car. I complained and only then did they agree and put us in a private hotel car. As if that's not bad enough, whilst on the way to the airport all of a sudden the car came to a screaming halt and the driver said ""WE GIVE HIM LIFT"" before we knew it we had a morroccan hitch hiker jumping in the front seat  of our privately hired car.

I have travelled to many places and stayed at varying quality hotels, I have never had the need to write any report on any of them whether good or bad, but I feel that thios needed to be said to prevent someone else making the same mistake that we did.
Incidentally, I must have spoken to over 30 couples around the hotel, of differing nationalities and not one could compliment the place, but all shared similar bad experiences as me.

TAKE MY ADVICE AVOID THIS PLACE LIKE THE PLAGUE, YOU'LL WASTE PRECIOUS TIME AND MONEY EVEN CONSIDERING IT."
"My partner and I have just returned from a week’s stay at the Sofitel, Agadir, which can only be described as a nightmare. 

Our flight arrived into Agadir at night and we were impressed by the welcome upon our arrival (mint tea and cleansing cloths served in the impressive lounge). However, we were awoken before 7am the next morning by noise from the construction of a new Sofitel, right next door to the wing we were staying in. 

The reception weren’t willing to change our accommodation, but eventually provided us with a new room later that afternoon. We checked the room before transferring our belongings and found it hadn’t even been cleaned– the beds were still warm! We found the reception staff lacking in basic hospitality training, as they offered no apology for this and were not prepared to offer us a clean room until the manager happened to walk past. We later discovered from other guests that they had experienced similar problems. 

Don’t expect a great deal from the service (reception / waiting staff). We found that every time we ordered refreshments or food (whether by the poolside or in the lounge area inside the hotel) there was a problem. Drinks we ordered didn’t arrive or took over 30 minutes, food arrived cold and was often not what we had even requested. As I speak fluent French and the waiters also speak fluent English, a language barrier is not an excuse and it was just plain inattention to detail. We were also offered a late check-out on the final day, to compensate for the initial problem with the room, only to be called twice by reception on the day to ask us to vacate in the morning, as they had changed their mind!

We found the rooms to be small and the cleaning questionable. A number of times the cleaning was only half completed, leaving us without towels and bedding for example. 

On our penultimate day we returned after breakfast to find the cleaner had left our door open while she cleaned another bedroom. Although we thought nothing of it at the time, we discovered later that one of our mobile phones was missing from the room and had been stolen. The hotel was keen to assert that it was not a member of staff or the fault of the cleaner for leaving the door ajar, however upon calling the mobile a woman answered and confirmed she worked at the hotel, before realising who I was. Our phone bill proves it was stolen while we were at breakfast, as it was used to call several Moroccan numbers. My advice is to always be on your guard even within the hotel. 

The hotel were not too cooperative regarding the theft and I have seen from other reviews that other travellers have been victims of theft at the hotel. 

Plus points – the building itself is magnificent and the poolside areas with hammocks, four-poster beds and sofas, make a wonderful area to relax. The hotel is situated in a tranquil location, next to the beach. Taxis into the centre cost around £1 and there are a few good restaurants, although Agadir is quite commercialised. 

The hotel could be a real sanctuary, however the appalling service detracts from its charm and makes for a stressful stay. I have stayed in better 3* hotels."
"I suppose I went to the hotel with high expectations. The rooms were small and there is a building site next door so BEWARE! The pool area was gorgeous but the pool was, in our opinion, dangerous, Thereare cracks in the ottom and both of our children cut their feet. Given that the cracks are in the shallow area where small children play I was very disappointed. Our rep was going to speak to the manager about it. 
Food at breakfast was good as was dinner but lunch was disappointing with extortionately priced snacks available. Paying £1.80 for a can of coke or other cold drinks was disappointing and one did feel that they were milking the situation. 
ON our first night wewaited 5 hours for a cot and it was only when I said they would find one or i would see the manager that I got one that I think they found in a cellar. Instead of a mattress they put in a duvet- a complete death trap for our 4 month old baby!
The kids club was entirely French with limited english spoken. And anyone who finds smoking a problem shouldn't come here as it is nearly all French who seem to chain smoke.
ON the positive side the people were so so friendly and loved the kids. Apart from the floor of the pool the kids enjoyed the various little rooms that surrounded the pool and the general size of the pool. The beach is gorgeous and for children is a briliant introduction to surfing. The sun beds were the best- 4 poster very comfy rooms but it is a case of getting up early to reserve one as they go fast.
Buy your water at the hyper market- is is a 1/10 of the hotel price. If you have kids then book half board before you go as booking meals in the hotel when there is extortionate. Eating out is a hassle as you have to go everywhere by cab as the hotel feels in the middle of no where. White mercedes cabs were sometimes hard to find and this was a bit of a worry when you have young children.
"
"After the hustle and bustle of Marrakech we were looking forward to the 11 days at the sofitel!!

The rooms are great, big bed and wonderfull bedding, you need to upgrade to a delux room as these have a balconey (our opinion)

This is a 5 star hotel with 4 star service and amminities, service is ok not great,.The choice of eating simply, at lunchtime is non existant in the end we shared a meal.
The prices are outragious a beer in the hotel is £4.06 outside £1.80, a bottle of wine £20 outside £8 and this is for the exact same wine, not impressed!!.
We had all our meals in the town apart from one evening. All the meals in the town were good to excellant and we never paid more than £20 each which included a bottle of wine plus coffee and brandy afterwards. In the hotel for the same without the coffee and brandies was £51 pound each.
So eat out the choice in the town was very good.
Not much to do at night unless you use the hotels disco which is impressive to say the least but once again you pay for the privlidge.
Overall relaxing but too expensive for what was on offer no way a 5 star establishment.
"
"Just returned from One week stay in May 2007 at the Soffitel
Now I know where the French go on holiday ...The service needs attention especally if they are trying to pass off for 5 stars which clearly they are not...Note there are no facilties in the rooms for making tea or coffee and when I inquired at reception ..abruptly  told that only economy hotels use these ...that was then I realised they dont stay in to many 5 Stars
Be aware of the pool...it's freezing and really to cold to swim..The hotel also over charges for bottle water 40dhr that's nearly £3.00 per ltr bottle when the local little supermarket charges 5dhr..Dont buy anything from the people on the beach you can get more choice at the airport...Try and change back money at your hotel and not the airport...they only could give me back euros... Have a good holiday

"We stayed just one night in this hotel after arriving in Agadir on our way to another part of Morocco.

First off, as we landed and collected our bags, we were gazumped by a porter who was very rude when we didn't tip him as we only had large Dirham notes (that we had just got out of the machine) - he insisted we gave him an English pound! Then the taxi ripped us off by charging 220 MAD for what should have been 170MAD from the airport to the Sofitel.

The hotel reception to book in has a very odd way of doing it - we were told to sit down and eventually a receptionist came and took our details....

We eventually got taken to our room which was very small, and contained an ashtray - so assuming this was a smoking room, I rang the desk and asked to be moved. They moved us to another room with an ashtray, so I gave up. We paid their top rate for a DEluxe room - but it was so small and they have no balconies - when I asked about what made this room Deluxe, I was told it was the view - Standard rooms get a garden view, Superior rooms get a pool view and Deluxe rooms get sea view! That's it, so don't waste your money booking a higher rate room!

The bed was extremely comfortable - that was a plus!

Our telephone rang at 2am - by the time I answered it, there was no-one there? It rang again at 4am! I think they ring the rooms when they're bored.

So, after a disturbed sleep, we ventured down to breakfast. We were led to a table next to smokers and only discovered later there is a no-smoking area! 

If you like bread for breakfast - you're well in.... anything else? Forget it. I was really disappointed - I found outside they were cooking eggs and pancakes but by then I wasn't hungry! I had eaten some bread.

Not at all impressed. 

We love Morocco and we love the people and have visited many times -we stayed in the Riu Tikada on the way out and it was excellent!
"
"we arrived late in the middle of the night at what can only be described as one of the most beautiful hotels we had seen we were given warm lemon towels to refresh and felt like this was going to be a great experience as our luggage was taken to our room swiftly.
The next morning we had a wander around the hotel and its grounds and what we saw we really liked (four poster beds on the private beach very nice!)
We took our seats on the white leather couches by the beach bar and awaited service...and waited...and waited...finally a young boy arrived after taking our drinks order he disappeared it took a further 10 minutes for someone else to come and confirm the drinks order and then someone else to bring the drinks.  I could actually see the fridge the drinks came from and could have got them myself a lot quicker!  anyway we put this first experience down to the hot sun and the slower pace especially as we had both had a hectic couple of weeks sorting out Christmas presents in London for family!
Anyway to cut a long story short this was the start of the worst service and attitude problem we encountered whilst staying in this hotel.  From wrong orders to aggrogant staff this is ceretainly the place to stay if you are looking for bad service!!!  The beauty of the hotel suddenly becomes unimportant when you feel on edge every time you order something and the staff act as if they are being put out...but strangely enough the bills for each beer or coke are quickly delivered to you faster than you can drink your drink!  If you are going to Agadir in our opinion stay here becuase it's better than the rest however just hope the staff have been given more training by the time you get there!!!

"Maybe five star hotel for people who only know 3 star hotel…
This hotel is really not a five star hotel instead of the others Sofitel.
Ok, the beach and pool are beautiful and very comfortable. 
The hotel is quite ok but the architects decide not to include balconies, so you feel like in a closed place inside of your room.
The room are really disappointing, small with no view…the bathroom is ok and quite big, but its not perfectly clean…lot of dust, but it’s certainly because of the big building site just next the hotel for the future Sofitel (they said two more years of work). Of course if you are the “wrong side” you will have a nice view on this and the early noise for the work…
We had to change three times the room to have the opportunities to make a full night…and some things disappeared in our bedroom (like sunglass and gift for my grandmother…nice???)
I’ll try an other one next time!!!

"I stayed here in November 2006. This hotel is awful and definately not a five star hotel. I have stayed in many 5 star hotels and this is nowhere near the usual standard. It took almost an hour to check in - we arrived independantly from Marrakech and as a tour group had just arrived we had to wait - check in staff treat you like children - you have to wait for them to come to you and they give you a group talk about breakfast and the rooms - it's very ""package"" holiday! What's wrong with walking to reception, handing over your credit card and checking in??? We got to our room, which overlooked a building site, to find there were already people in the room as they had requested a late check out - we had to go back to check-in who were not apologetic at all.

The pool area is nice however the pool is not heated so you have to be brave to go in! Breakfast was okay but the coffee is terrible - very watered down - and the service is slow if you ask for anything that is not on the breakfast buffett.

This is full of people on package holidays and isn't a five star. It's okay but know what you are letting yourself in for and don't expect luxury or the usual five star treatment.

"My sister (aged 21) and myself (aged 26) have just returned after spending 7 nights in the Sofitel, Agadir. First impressions of the hotel were that it looked rather bland from the outside. After being greeted hello in French and entering the hotel I was pleasantly suprised. The foyerr was grand and felt luxurious - It had white curtains draped from ceiling to the floor and a Moroccon cutured seating area with colorful cushions and rugs.

We were seated while a member of staff took our luggage and checked us in. In the meantime we were given cold towels to freshen up and offered mint tea which was pleasant.

After about 10 minutes we were given our room key. When we checked in we had asked for a higher floor thinking that would ensure a better view of the sea. We were given the highest floor, namely the 3rd which we came to realise was a big mistake.

The room decor was fine. It had 2 dark wooden wardrobes and plenty of mirrors for us vain girls! No obvious dust in cupboards, and there were 2 single beds. Notably one of the throws on the beds had stains. When I pulled back the curtains I had a big disappointment. Our view was one of a construction site underway. There were tractors and a big open space where work had started. No view of a pool in sight and certainly no view of a beach.

I rang to ask if we could change rooms, and was told what we had was a standard room, and if we wanted to change to a pool view it was around an extra £25 per night and even more than this for a sea view. We decided to live with the view.

Having just returned 2 months earlier from Dubai where we stayed in the Jumeirah Beach Hotel, I have to say that Sofitel was proving to be a let down. I tried not to compare the 2 as Dubai is in a totally different league, but the view in Sofitel was more than poor. First major disappointment.

The bathroom was nice. It had 2 basins so great for when my sister and I wanted to use the bathroom together. There was a bath with shower over, which was nice and powerful. There was also a bidet in the bathroom and a very large mirror. All done in a Moroccon themed crafted dark wood.

Breakfast was good. Large seating area served until 10am. There was choice of omlettes, toast, sausage etc, fresh fruit, cereals and bread. Something for everyone. 

The pool area was pleasant. Lots of children (something to bear in mind for couples), but I guess it was school holidays. There was a heated pool which was great when the sun was going down. The pool areas were very busy with children everyday until the sun went down. One day we enjoyed water aerobics in the pool.

There were hammocks galore!! They were everywhere, on the grass around the pool and in secluded spots leading to the beach area. There was also a table tennis table near the pool area. Towels were provided near the pool. 

There was a restaurant near the pool area which served some decent light snacks, however it was very costly. A can of coke cost £2 and an ice lolly cost £2.50. A meal for 2 came to around £30 which was expensive for what was supposed to be a light lunch.

The hotel was located right on the beach. It is the last hotel on the beach strip row of hotels so we managed to get a quieter, cleaner part of it., however when walking along, it got noiser, much busier and dirtier. Overall our section of beach had clean fine grained sand.

There were also 4 poster beds scattered around the pool area. These were amazing. They had white leather mattresses, brown leather cushions and curtains which could be drawn for privacy. Very nice indeed. They were perfect to escape the sun or to lounge in with sheesha in the evening. Note, the hotel did serve sheesha but for a sheesha lover and expert like me I found the quality was very poor. The beds were washed every evening which was a good thing.

Everything seemed to be going good for our first day. We had slept in the hammocks and accepted the fact that this holiday was all going to be in French!! Everyone spoke French!! It was difficult to communicate even with hotel staff who spoke very little English which was suprising.

Then came the second major disappointment of the day. As we were returning to our room in the evening we smelt a rather strange smell. Something like a sewer. NOT NICE!! This smell seemed to be there from that point on everytime we came out of our room. It was very unpleasant and did not go away the whole holiday. One day the smell came INTO our bedroom, closing the windows did not help. It got so bad that my sister literally was heaving in the bathroom.

The corridor did not get any better when it came to lights. It was lit very dimly with side lights which barely provided enough light to see. This was not a good thing regarding health and safety.

The bedroom safety deposit box broke down on us 2 times in the 7 days we were there so we had to call for help. The rooms were not cleaned properly. Things were not folded away, just piled up on the side instead. The hotel staff service was at times poor. Many of them could not speak English and we were left waiting for food so long on one occasion in the restaurant after ordering it that we had to cancel it altogether.

The hotel had an excellent bar and lounge called the 'SO LOUNGE'. It opened around 12am and started to get busy around 1am. It was free for hotel guests but otherwise £20. The dcor was fantastic. It had 2 levels and a great chill out room with gorgeous decor. This room has ceiling to floor drapes with large mattress sized seats with cushions, all covered in silk and satin. Very luxurious and sexy.

The bar had live music every night. The singers performed music from The Black Eyed Peas, Justin Timerblake, Shakira to name a few. Very entertaining. After they finished the DJ played house/ trance and techno. 

Note, there was a restauarant attached to the So Lounge. This was a lovely place and food was good but expensive. Dessert alone was around £10 per person.

The night life was generally poor outside of the hotel bar. We were recommended the 'Papagayo' club which was full of teenagers. We felt out of place and left after 30 minutes, despite paying 100Dirhams each to enter (£7)

Other points to note that I wish someone had told me before I booked Sofitel was that the bed sheets were not changed all week. A guest who was staying at the same time as us told me that her bed sheets were not changed and she had stayed 13 nights at that stage.

We did an excursion to Marracech as a day trip. Picked up at 6am, 4 hour drive with a gropu of 8 people in air conditioned bus. Drive there was ok but the heat on arrival was a shocking 45 degrees!! We were shown around the King's Palace and Gardens, the Square with snake charmers and dancing monkeys etc and souks (markets). Lunch and evening meal were provided. We returned at 12 midnight. The day cost £48. It was worth doing simply because you can't go to Morocco and not see Marracech. Note to buy gifts etc stick to Agadir which is cheaper.

Other excursions included a trip to the Immouzer mountains which I would never do again. A whole day driving though mountains in a jeep...rocky roads...no air conditioning...not good. We visited local Berber people and had tea and fresh biscuits which was good to experience. Take loose change for the children and some pens!! The children ask for pens and would rather have these than sweets!!

We also did the Berber evening where we were taken to a Berber camp where around 200 tourists gathered for belly dancing, singing and to sample the local Moroccon cuisine called 'tagine' prepared fresh for us. This was worth doing to get a feel for Morocco.

Overall I am glad I went to Agadir because there is so much hype around it at the moment but I dont think I would go back. The best things - beach with hammocks/4 poster beds, fake sunglasses and watches, and the So Lounge! The bad things bad smell in the corridor, very few English speakers made it difficult to communicate, pervy Moroccon men, nowhere to smoke decent sheesha.

Note of interest was that on numerous occasions we were told by tour guides and locals that Sofitel was the best hotel in Agadir. Overall the rooms and corridors need improvement. Staff should learn to speak English. Outside the back of the hotel was lovely.

Definately not 5 star as we were told when booking. More like 4 star.

"Staff was friendly only when tipped. No knowledge of french, english or german when problems came up: just arabic spoken. definitely not the right hotel for people in wheelchair: paraplegic rooms are dark, noisy (overlooking the bar and restaurant terrace with music all night!), bathroom without shower, just tub without handles.

"I spent a week in the Sofitel Agadir in october 2005; I've never seen a worse 5 or 4 or even 3 stars hotel: The reception was icy, with only a poor tea served. The room looked over a building site, and though others were vacant, it was impossible to have it changed.The rooms,dark, are badly designed: transparent window between bathroom and bedroom, and only openworked wood panel between WC and bathroom. No balcony too. The care of the room was under minimum, with hairs forgotten in bathroom and no cleaning under the bed. The food was desastrous: three raw vegetables as appetizers, only one meat, the same tajine the week long, the bottle of mineral water 3€ . The dining room was noisy and closed, as if you were staying in arctic. One of the tennis playground was closed, the other damaged, and the responsible blamed you if you used it too often, since it was shared with other hotels. However, the boss owns a Porsche Cayenne and everyday, a man spent 1hour and half to wash it(tyres included!!). No comment.

"I stayed at the Sofitel, Agadir for 1 week at the end of October with my husband and 12 month old baby. I had booked direct with the hotel and got a great deal on a Junior suite, Kingsize bed with sofa and ocean view. We also booked transfers with the hotel from the airport (400DH- we later learned that you should not pay over 150DH. We arrived at the hotel and were greeted with mint tea, hot towels etc, so far so good. We were taken to our room which was basically 2 interconnecting twin rooms with a pool view, no sofa. To begin with reception tried to convince us that this was a suite and it took some time before we were given again 2 interconnecting rooms, however this time with a Kingsize bed in one and sofa in the other- the ocean view never materialised. The hotel was a welcome haven from Agadir itself which we found to be a bit of a dump. The service overall was terrible, eg: meals never turning up when ordered via room service, waiting 45 minutes for coffee in our rooms, taking ages to get served and receive food at lunchtime which is not ideal when with a baby, chasing up laundry after 3 days, at 6pm still had not had the room made made up despite 5 call to house keeping and 2 to reception! etc etc. Other aspects of the hotel that were a disappointment were that the towels were brittle and scratchy and there were no pay per view films. I would not reccomend this hotel purely because the dreadful service did not make it easy to relax into the holiday at all. Agadir itself is also not somewhere I would recommend it was very dirty and run down, not in a way that is endearing like parts of Malaysia and Thailand, rather more like somewhere you want to leave.
