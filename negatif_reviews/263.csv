"Rude worker.
Cold water.
I booked and when i came my rooms are occupied.
When i paid for 4 beds i got 3 beds and they said: ""The couch is a bed"".
When I came they started overcharing me and when I said that I needed to pay 500 dhs less.
I don't reccomend this hotel
They keep trying to scam everyone."
"I booked a standard room with balcony.  When booking in early 2024, I requested a room on a high floor with balcony, bath and shower in a quiet part of the hotel.
On check in, I was allocated room 106 on ground with a table and chairs outside door but no private balcony as on ground floor. Any person could access this outdoor area. I discovered that the sliding glass door was broken and it could not be securely locked. I alerted management snd asked for a secure room with proper private balcony on a high floor. I was a woman holidaying alone with children and was particularly concerned about the safety of myself and my children.  A female staff member and workman attended room 106 and said the door was now repaired. When I tested the door I found it was impossible to open. I asked the female member of staff how I could get out of the room and she said I should call her and she would come and open the sliding door.  I was shocked at such a ridiculous response and asked her how we would manage if there was a fire and did she understand fire regulations etc? I told the manager and I was then offered either a 4th floor room with no balcony or 1140 which had s balcony but had a bad damp smell. The staff absolutely refused any other option re room for the 1st night. I took room 1140 snd later found out why it smelled of damp. When I used the shower the bathroom completely flooded. I asked the manager to move me to another room as my room 1140 had flooded  The Manager sent myself, desk clerk and a workman with toolbox to look at another room. Clearly the requirement to have the wotkman with toolbox accompany us to the 4th hotel room was not a good sign. This room was also on ground floor and I feared for security of doors etc snd what job the workman was required for.  I refused to take this ground floor room and the manager said I should leave hotel if I didn’t like it. I believe this was a disgusting way to treat a lone female traveller who was alone in Agadir with children. I booked this holiday early in 2024. I am not familiar with Agadir and it would have been very difficult and unsafe for myself and my children to leave Argana hotel at night time to find another hotel.  I did absolutely nothing wrong. I booked a standard hotel room with balcony in good faith snd expected the hotel staff to provide a secure lockable room with a proper balcony and with s proper functioning bathroom on checkin. My children couldn't shower the first day because the bathroom flooded. I requested a refund from Argana Manager for the first night because the hotel did not honour the booking to provide a proper standard of hotel room. The manager became very angry and said again I could leave if I didnt likeit and why dont I just stop complaining etc.I was very shocked at his attitude.
I believe that I was bullied by the manager and treated badly because I am a woman travelling alone with my children.  I do not believe that a man would have received this same treatment from Hotel Argana and would have been provided with a proper standard hotel room on check inand with a non aggressive attitude . It was very obvious that there were other hotel rooms available and the manager was unwilling to give me a superior room because my booking was for a standard room with balcony. However the manager did not have any proper standard rooms available, so bullied myself and put myself and my vulnerable children into a flooded room snd said if Ii didn't like it, I should get another hotel.  I beleive the reception desk staff were embarressed about what was happening and that we were in a room that kept flooding but they said there is nothing they can do as the manager must give them authorisation.  I believe this was absolutely despicable behaviour towards a genuine hotel guest who arrived at the hotel with children expecting to enjoy a lovely holiday. 
I was moved to another standard room (4111) on day 2 and this room was of a normal standard I would expect with a functioing balcony door and a bathroom that did not flood. I again requested a refund for 1st night because of the terrible way I was trreated on arrival. The manager became very angry again and said that he would actually be charging myself extra now because he had actually moved mysel fto a superior room. I questioned this as I could see that the room I was in matched the phorgraphs of a standard room on the website. I also told the manage that I never asked for an upgraded room.I just wanted the standard room with balcony that I booked.I was then very worried that the hotel manager would falsely allocate this upgrade fee to my booking and take the funds from my credit card. I  alerted the front desk receptionist to what the manager had said he would do to me. The receptioinst told me on check out that there were no extra charges so that was a relief but I was very worried prior to checkout because Im a single mother and I live on a budget and I dont have spare cash for extra costs that I didnt genuinely incur. I also asked other guests on my corridor who had the same type of room whether they booked standard or superior rooms and they all said they booked standard rooms. Therefore I believe the Manager was lying about my finalroom (4111) being a superior room. Needless to say, I had a very stressfulholiday and I wont be going back.  There are nice aspects of this hotel such as the restaurant staff but unfortunately all was overshodowed by the treatment I received from the Argana Manager."
"Avoid at all costs – truly disappointing.

The initial room had no air conditioning and felt like a sauna. The bathroom had a sewage odour, making it very difficult to stay even for the first night. After numerous requests, I was eventually given an upgrade, and I’ve attached pictures showing the condition of the upgraded room.

On a positive note, the entertainment staff worked hard, and a few people at the restaurant genuinely tried to do their best. However, I would never recommend this hotel to anyone."
"Nobody warned me that there is very loud entertainment outside all of the rooms in the pool area until 11pm at night. There is also loud construction happening all throughout the day. I asked reception if there were any quieter rooms and they told me that all were the same and weren't sympathetic at all. 

Don't book if you like to go to bed early, or want a relaxing time sitting on your terrace!"
"We spent 6 nights at hotel argana. We are a couple in our late 20s and we were hoping for a relaxing stay, however this was made impossible by the neighbouring club which plays loud music until 6 am and even 7am some nights !!!! There is no sound proofing in the rooms so it felt like the speaker was in our room at times. 
The hotel room itself was fine, but much more run down and dirtier than in the photos. Our aircon unit blew a smell of stagnant water into the room so we didnt use it, there was hair in the bath drain when we arrived and some of the towels had mascara still on them so definitely room for improvement in terms of cleaning. The shampoo and body wash was nice and the cleaning staff were generous in how much they left us. The cleaning staff made our beds and emptied our bins each day.
The pool area was very nice but the music being played and the constant activities meant that relaxing by the pool is not possible. If you are holidaying here you will have to be willing to get involved in the activities organised by the animation team. The animation team were all so lovely and energetic and definitely great for keeping kids entertained, but for us we would have preferred a quieter pool area to read/relax.
We only ate breakfast in the hotel as it was included, there was a lot on offer for breakfast but the quality of food varied a lot. The fresh pancakes were great but the pastries were often stale.
Overall, the staff are lovely but the hotel needs a lot of improvement. This was not the hotel for us, and not for anyone looking to relax or sleep."
"Breakfast like a scrum, reception smells of smoke from the bar, and whilst there seemed to be plenty for the children to keep them entertained, they felt the need to shout it over the PA system and play music unnecessarily loudly. There is also building work going on and the music from the hotel behind goes on until 2am."
"This hotel started with our dinner which was terrible i wouldnt even give this to my dog secondaly the children there were monstors almost drowned my child an broke his watergun which he had bought with his own  money i wont reccomend this here."
"Hotel room was poor, had two singles mattresses instead of a double bed and they were not very comfortable, sink was blocked took ages to drain, AC blew smelly not cool air, damp in bathroom as extractor didn't work and bathroom was generally poor with door not closing! Asked for a quiet room, however, was given one by the pool which was noisy throughout the day and night! No iron available to use and were required to pay for the use of the safe. At the pool bar seating we were asked to purchase items if we wished to sit there! No kettle or supplied water in rooms. Generally our room and the hotel was very dated basic and tired more like a 3 star not a 4! Food was poor, bland with little options for kids. Staff were helpful and friendly. Work ongoing at hotel making the pool bar area dusty and noisy."
"Great location, staff were very friendly and accommodating with our requests and the breakfast was really good. Unfortunately there was a lot of noise from the night club next door in the room we stayed in - even with noise cancelling ear phones it was impossible to sleep. If you plan to visit at the weekend maybe you can request a room away from the noise - it was a pity because otherwise it would have been an enjoyable stay."
"No air con . reception did not want to know , we got no help even from love holidays  the ,waiter was wiping knives and forks with a cloth and putting them back on table .worst holiday ever ,safe wasn't even screwed down ,so any one could have walked away with it and they wanted £5 a day  then night club which is attached to the hotel kicked out at 4.30 am and was that noisy it woke me up every day"
"Te overall experience was marred by several customer service issues that need urgent attention.

Upon our arrival from the airport at 12 PM (before the check-in time), we were unexpectedly informed of an additional tax that we were not aware of beforehand. This lack of transparency was the first of several inconveniences. We were told our rooms would be ready by 3 PM, but they were not available until after 4:30 PM. Throughout this period, we had to repeatedly check with the reception and join long queues just to get any updates. After 3 PM, we should not have had to wait and queue for updates. This was the worst customer service I had ever experienced, especially since we had been up for a while and were all starting to feel a bit light-headed. I was astonished that we received nothing complimentary to apologise for this delay, and the receptionists didn't behave like it was a big deal, seeming to pay more attention to other guests. We felt undervalued. By 4:30 PM, when our room still wasn't ready, we were so furious at our treatment that we had to go for a walk to let off some steam. We strongly considered leaving the hotel and going elsewhere as we did not feel like we were wanted. To add to our frustration, we observed other guests arriving throughout the week being met with traditional tea and assistance with their bags.

While waiting for our room to be ready, we started feeling warm and asked for some water at the reception. Instead of providing any assistance, we were directed to a store next door. I had to stop myself from laughing at this response; the whole situation felt like a comedy sketch or a training video of how not to do customer service in every single instance. I was genuinely taken back by this response, as such a simple request should have been met with the most basic hopsitality. The cherry on top was when the receptionist informed me that there would be water in my room, but I had to wait until my room was ready to have it.

When we finally accessed our room, the air conditioning was not working. We had to report this issue and wait for it to be fixed. Although the air conditioning was never fixed, they did bring in an air con unit for the room that night.

One major issue was the pool towel situation. We were not informed about the pool closing time or the system for the green beach/pool towels. This oversight led to a situation where we left our towels by the pool only to find them removed and locked away when we returned to the hotel at 9:30 PM. The reception then informed us that we could not retrieve them until the next day as the hotel workers did not have access to the storage box. When I reported this issue to the receptionist, they checked with someone who insisted nothing had been found when they were cleaning up the pool area. I was given extra towels for that night, but it was frustrating to learn the next day that my towels were in the green box all along. The receptionist's apathetic and unhelpful attitude left me feeling undervalued as a guest. Better communication and a more caring approach from the reception could have easily avoided this scenario.

Additionally, the cleaning staff were very polite and tried their best to communicate that we needed to place an indicator on our door if we wanted our room cleaned. This is usually something explained by the reception upon check-in. The cleaning schedule also seemed later than what I have experienced in other North African hotels.

The bar staff were very friendly, though the service was on the slower side and some drinks were quite weak and inconsistent. The waiters were great, but it would have been helpful if the water system during meals was explained to us. On our first day, we did not have any drinks with our meals as we assumed from our earlier experience with reception that the hotel did not provide water to guests as a policy. It was only after speaking to another guest that we understood what we were entitled to. It is completely unacceptable to have to rely on other guests to get the information that should be provided by the hotel staff.

In summary, while Hotel Argana has a good location and some commendable features, significant improvements in customer service are necessary. The staff must adopt a proactive approach to better meet guest needs. Clear communication, better responsiveness, and a more welcoming attitude could vastly enhance the guest experience."
"Oh my god!!!! Of course an honest review AS ALWAYS.
I‘ll talk about my personal experience step by step.
First point: THE ROOMS
The rooms were honestly clean, but the Hotel safe don‘t work, i had to take with me to the pool to whoever i go my expensive things.
The housekeeping was taking too much my room was until 4pm not cleaned yet. They don’t offer anything in the room just to keep on mind, no water, no tea, no coffee no electic kettle.
Second point: THE SWIMMINGPOOL 
the swimmingpool was full of Chlorine, it was really crowded. Ive never seen the children and the adults swim in the same pool until i got into this Hotel, at 4pm the pool gets really really REALLY dirty and warm its like a jacuzzi not a swimming pool, which is understandable with the „Children“.
Third point: THE ENTERTAINMENT 
The agents of the entertainment were so nice and friendly (the only good thing in this hotel) they were doing so many activities, we played we danced we did sing, it was really cool.
Fourth point: THE INTERNET 
The internet is really terrible, just to let u know i had suddenly a meeting with my boss i had to reschedule it and go to a Coffeehouse to do my meeting instead of doing it in my room in complete silence.. unfortunately the wifi was so terrible i had to watch my uploaded serie on Netflix on my phone.
Fifth point: THE RESTAURANT 
We booked Buffet (Breakfast and Dinner) and it wad terribly terrible. The croissant was a really really cheap one, not too easy to eat, the dishes weren’t something wow i had two times to go out and eat something else in the restaurants outside. The pizza was terrible ive never seen in my whole life a pizza with only cheese and tomato sauce.
The agents weren’t so nice, something happened to me twice, i was eating my dish and the waiter comes and takes from me my plate and i haven’t finished my dish. The agents look at me so weird and one of them came to me and said the table is reserved if u finish its better to leave. EXCUSE ME? Since when we ask the client to leave and he hadn’t finished his plate yet.. it was really terrible. 
Sixth point: THE LOCATION 
The location is really good, u‘re in the center of Agadir, u can walk to the beach (they have a private Beach i didnt go to) u can walk to the Corniche 
Seventh point: THE HOTEL RESTAURANT/BAR
It was terrible i wanted to drink a cappuccino and the waiter said no we don’t have warm drinks and he obliged my little family to drink something and my daughter didn’t want to drink something other than Hot chocolate and the waiter said no we don‘t have it and still gave a side eye to my daughter.

That was everything i‘ve experienced in this hotel, never coming back honestly."
"Worst customer service I’ve had to date and I’ve been on many holidays. Pools incredibly small, toilet smells and the beds are really uncomfortable. If the customer service was better my experience may have not been as bad but all staff are completely unhelpful and unprofessional and they never smile. Would not re visit"
"Worst stays do not book. Ac in 2/3 rooms broken. Rooms had no towels and when requested we were told we were lying and already had towel this went on for 3 hours even after checking the rooms. Toilets constantly emitted a very unpleasant smell. Customer service 0/10"
"This hotel is far from 4 star standard. More like a 2 star. Or if anyone has stayed in a Britannia hotel in uk it’s standard is more to this! Really needs modernising and a lot of repairs. 
Our room safe did not work, the interlocking door to the next room is easily opened and no sound proofing, the door to bathroom did not lock or shut properly. There was no netting or lining between the windows and curtains. 
The sink and toilet both leaked. The shower did not work when turned on would come out of the overflow. The toilet seat was round but the toilet itself was square so did not fit properly. 
I did attempt to talk to reception however the male staff on duty was not the most welcoming. So left it as we was only stayed a few days. Our room was located at the side back of the hotel, the outside view was that of the back yard which had been used to store old beds, chairs and just rubble. So awful view. The corridors echo so loudly that’s it’s impossible to get any sleep at night as well as music coming from next door and the nightclub til the early hours.
Also do not go to this hotel if your female and would like a glass of wine with your meal or a cocktail at the pool side you get ignored on purpose. However when ordering soft drinks their attitudes change. 
The waitresses are to be found chatting together in groups rather than serving people.
Food in the restaurant varied every night. Was great when they had the items being cooked to order but the evenings when this was not on was very sub standard. Breakfast lots of choice and great selection of fruit and yogurts. 
Breakfast fresh doughnuts and pancakes was also being made. We had two servers one was lovely he set the table and looked after us at every meal time. However the other waiter a young man, would only accept cash for drinks and charged us differently every time for what we had white was soda, and we had been charged for water which we later found out was actually free from other guests. He also never would give us change or a receipt. Bit silly not to take card payments in the hotel restaurant. House keeping were lovely and came in everyday to make up beds and tidy up. They was very polite to us when see in corridor or throughout the hotel. Lift is for hotel use only so no good if your on top floor. Also if your arriving expect to play tourist tax. The hotel again only accepts cash for this! Which most people are not going to have when arriving. The pool was manned every day all day. They had entertainment on stage at night however it’s not situated in a great place so you can’t get a seat where you can see what’s going on. The bar areas need a lot of repairs and work doing to them. Very untidy and messy! Also construction work going on between the two bars. Overall it was ok to some extent but don’t book this expecting 4 star because it really isn’t to the same 4 star standard in Europe."
"The hotel is most definitely not 4 stars, but more like 2 stars in european standards.
This is the worst hotel I’ve ever been in, it requires significant modernisation. It is near a nightclub, it was so loud that I couldn’t sleep properly through a single night of my entire stay!!! In the early morning you could hear arguments and rowdiness from outside the nightclub!!! The hotel is also currently undergoing renovations, if you enjoy dirty, unpleasant looking painter foils hanging in the bar and other parts of the hotel then you’ll find this place ideal. The bathroom was also filled with mould and there wasn’t even a handle for opening the shower, not to mention the lack of towels for a good amount of the day because the cleaning lady takes them in the morning and doesn’t give them back until 16:00.  The reception workers were unkind, uninteresting and unwilling to help!! Despite my emails prior to my arrival kindly asking for a small happy birthday note for my husband’s birthday and them replying to assure they’ll do this, nothing was done!!! Also, there is far too many guests for such a small dining area, causing great trouble in finding a seat and the busiest times, so unless you enjoy waking up at 6 in the morning, good luck at finding a seat. The dining area is noisy, chaotic, and packed tightly with as much people as possible, so you’ll be stressing over whether you will manage to find a seat and get some scraps of food instead of relaxing like you should be. Not to mention how unclean it is, with the tables not being thoroughly wiped down but food remains being wiped onto the floor which then stayed there."
"I don't know where to start, but I never thought would be giving a review this low. This has to be the worst hotel we have ever stayed. How it's given 4 stars is beyond me.

HOTEL RECEPTION
Appears clean and tidy, fairly welcoming with large sofas and tables to relax at. Staff are friendly. There is a room where you can leave cases and bags before and after checkin/out. We weren't given the option of early check-in so had to use the room. We had an  11 am flight and check-in is not til 4pm, so expect to get in your room any earlier. There is an ATM machine in the lobby and the exchange rate when we were there was 11.34, so much better than  in the UK. It's much safer to use than exchanging elsewhere too. All in the lobby is an excursion desk. The guy was there every day from around 8 to 7 in the evening. He is very helpful and knowledgeable on the area. We used him for some excursions which were excellent! (Day to Marrakech and a Safari adventure). There is a convenience store next door to the hotel where you can buy bottled water (50p for 2ltr approx).

ROOMS
On first appearance the room looked clean, however looks can be very deceiving!! Room in dire need of repair. Bath stained, tatty discoloured shower curtain. Water marks and dirt around sink taps. Bedroom curtains didn't meet in the middle or touch the floor. Balcony door didn't lock. Room door sort of locked. Looked like it had been forced open at some point as some of the wood was broken around the frame. No ceiling light only side lights either side of the bed .so was very dark in the evenings. Only 5 hangers in wardrobe even though there were plenty of space for more. If you want to use the safe it cost £2.50 a day. Nowhere to hang wet stuff on the balcony, only over the chairs. One of the plug sockets was out of the wall.  If your idea of a holiday is to have a quiet relaxing time this place is not for you. The rooms overlooking the pool also overlook the disco next door which goes on till the early hours, so as well as the pool bar we didn't get much sleep, and yes we wore earplugs too. We went on an excursion one day and got back at 9pm and our balcony door had been left open all day!!! The maid goes in everyday although not sure what to do. They made the bed, towels were taken and not replaced. On our penultimate day they didn't clean at all so We had  o loo roll. Our daughter had to ask for towels as none left in her room. It seemed like things got worse as the week went on, it was laughable.

INTERNET
Very patchy arou d the hotel.  Ours was best around the pool, our daughters was best on the balcony? Not the best so if this is important to you good luck. 

RESTAURANT
Surprisingly we found the food ok. Quite a bit to choose from although never very hot! If you are travelling with children there is a very limited variety for them.  They did pizza a couple of nights but unless they are adventurous with food they wont get much. The coffee machines in the morning didn't always give coffee just milk and water!! I told one of the waiters and he just shrugged his shoulders. Meals were always a bit of a free for all and a lot of pushing and lack of manners from other guests. Some of the staff were ok. A couple of times we were shown to a table and noticed ants all over it. All the waiter did was push them off. We weren't going to sit there so moved elsewhere.  You can't order wine by the glass so have to get a bottle, but then your not allowed to take it out of the restaurant and had to finish It!!! 

POOL BAR
Not enough seating for the amount of guests if you want to watch the entertainment so we didn't bother. The food in the bar is ok and I would recommend the club sandwich.

In the evening if you want to sit in the lobby it's too smoky to sit anywhere as the doors from the bar Windsor are open. This is a sports bar , very dark inside and for drinks you have to go to reception to pay for them!!! Strange set up.  The Bar staff are not friendly at all, very slow and looked you as if you shouldn't be there.  

Despite all of the above, putting that aside we had an amazing time in Agadir and there is so much to do.  We probably did more than we would do normally so that wedding spend  much time at the HOTEL."
"We had 2 family rooms with a balcony and sea view. The rooms we were given however were at the front of the hotel, overlooking a busy road. One room was next door to what I can I my describe as a building site and the other was right next to a niteclub. At 1 am I rang reception to ask what time the music finished, I was told 3am, unfortunately this was not true at it kept going until 5am. When we complained we were promised a beach view room the next day but this never happened, instead we were put in the room next to the room with the building site. The air conditioning was also out of order for the 3 nights we were there. This was never mentioned when we were booking. The staff were not very helpful. Promised alot but did not deliver. It is not a place I would recommend to stay in unless you are one of the lucky few who actually get the room that you booked."
"we were suggested to pay £238 and we can eat at their hotel Buffet which we have agreed to but the food is not worth the money or taste, and after trying to get hold of manager 4 5 times, but no response. Very disappointed.
I would suggest eating out"
"Terrible place.not good staff.. behaviour issues.This place is absolutely terrible, run down and hence over priced. For same room rate you can stay at the good hotels which are 100% better than this.
Book anywhere else but not this one .. .."
"Overall bad experience, construction noises are so loud nearby. The staff wasn't corporative. 
Management was unable to understand it was on of the worst travelling experience of my life so far. 

The last thing any tourist would want is to experience that kind of customer service.."
"The jist of my review is that 
1. DO NOT BOOK UNLESS YOU LIKE TO HEAR CONSTRUCTION WORK FROM YOUR BEDROOM
2. POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE
3. WILL NOT GIVE US OUR REFUND 

The hotel is going under construction work in and outside the hotel. We received no notification prior to checking in. we only found out after we had paid and were outside our rooms and saw 2 men hammering and drilling.
The only notification provided was a letter inside the room. Also none of the surrounding rooms seemed occupied, so only we were out there.

Asked for different rooms, was told no by sakina, the day receptionist as they were fully booked, told to come the following morning and they MAY have availability.

Went to see our 3rd room and it had mold in the bathroom, the wardrobes looked worn out and about to break.
We all agreed and called another hotel to see availability and they did.

Went to reception again and asked for a refund and that we could not stay in the rooms they had given us. The night receptionist Mohamed Amin said that we would need to speak to the manager as he could not issue a refund.
The manager was not at the hotel and would be 15 minutes. We said we would wait.

Mohamed Amin rang the manager and then told us they magically had new rooms for us after us being told they were fully booked???

We decided to view these new rooms as we were waiting for the manager anyways.
On the way to the new rooms there was a leak from the ceiling in the hallway which caused a huge puddle (health and safety hazard)
Our last room shown was opposite to our original rooms next to the construction. It was now around 6 ish so they had stopped the work. I had recorded the sound and shown Mohamed Amin how loud the nose was from our room. He then understood and stopped trying to get us to stay.

We were taken back to reception and the manager still wasn’t in LOL.
Mohamed Amin then had the authority to issue a refund somehow. We asked for a receipt of the refund and were told they do not provide one and that our payment receipt is all the proof we need.

We even visited the hotel again on 8/05 to enquire about proof of our refund as UK banks would require this, spoke to Mohamed Amin again who told us we had to email 
Service Réservation . He verbally confirmed that he himself had issued our refund and that we’d get it by the end of the week (10/05)

Whilst we were still in Morocco we emailed and rang the service reservation department and spoke to a lady called Hanane who promised us she would get back to us as soon as regarding the status and proof of our refund .

It has been 15 days since and we haven’t received the refund still. 
I received two replies:

10/05 that my enquiry would be forwarded to their finance department 

11-13/05 I emailed again asking for an update

13/05 they will get back to me 
 
No communication from them since!! No refund either!! If they had issued a refund like they’d said we definitely would have received the money by now.

I am now disputing this with my bank and hopefully will get the money back.

SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BOOK ELSEWHERE"
"Do not book this hotel! Save your money.
Booked this hotel for 7 of us, family and friends and we were extremely disappointed. 
The pictures of the rooms were not as shown. The hotel is still getting refurbished and most of us were put in unfinished rooms with hammering and drilling from the outside of our rooms and the rooms next door to us. That part of the hotel should not have been accessible forget having guests stay there. 
Two of us got rooms that had broken floors, cupboards and mold over the bathroom sink and bath tub. 
We asked for a refund and the hotel confirmed we would get one, we still have not received it after emails and calls and going back to the hotel again. It has been over 2 weeks. 
We were looking forward to this holiday and it has just been an awful experience."
"We had 7 days at the Argarna hotel and overall was disappointing. I must say the staff are excellent and very helpful and are a credit though. We had room 2124 with a sea view and new decor. This ruined the week as the  night nightclub  was open to  about 4 am each night. The next morning we tried breakfast and that was ok but not the most adventurous menu. We laid by the pool only to hear the constant hammer drill and chipping away with hammers until mid evening. We complained about this to reception and all they said they will speak to the manager. We also asked to change rooms to be told there were only the older type available. The bar food is of a good standard but the cocktails are awful and staff need training on what ingredients should be in them.  Evening meals in the restaurant were very average and was missing that extra bit. We chose to eat out  even though we had meals included. It would be great if hotels advises of building works when booking as you go on holiday to relax and not listen to industrial machines."
"We had read mixed reviews before booking, so we were slightly apprehensive for our stay. I’ve never left a bad review for anywhere or at least try to keep it balanced but the start to our stay was disappointing at hotel Argana, we’d emailed about airport transfers with flight times ect , when we arrived there was no one there, had to sort our own taxi at midnight-we complained at the desk and the problem was never resolved.
 We got there and they gave us the wrong room , we booked a double with a sea view& balcony , the room we were given was nothing like the photos on booking, it was outdated, had 3 single beds, (not much use for me and my husband) was by the busy and noisy road, the air con didn’t work and only half the lights worked, we went back to reception to complain who said they ‘were having problems with rooms tonight’ and to come back at breakfast for an ‘upgrade’. Also the door didn’t lock upon leaving the room, nothing was done about this. It was 1am at this point so we had an awful night sleep in a hot, noisy room. Went back to reception the next morning and were told we could have a ‘superior room’ like they were doing us a favour -when in fact this is what we actually had booked. The receptionist said ‘the room you are in is old and not as nice, we’ll give you a renovated one’. We had to wait until 2pm for the room. 
So we went spent the day by the pool while we waited , the hotel is undergoing construction work and there was hammering, drilling and banging around the pool and in the building all day until 9pm at night -on top of already being tired and let down -it was not relaxing. 
While at reception we heard other guests complaining of the exact same problem of not having the room they paid for. 
Breakfast was good, lots of choice , but dinner was just okay, definitely go outside the hotel for authentic Moroccan food. 
The staff at the pool bar were lovely but the cocktails on the list did not match up with what you received, not the right ingredients were put into them -what you ordered wasn’t what you got.
The staff work really hard to keep the hotel clean and the maids did an excellent job of room service.  It’s also easy to organise trips /experiences through the hotel. 
There is a night club right outside the hotel and depending on where you are in the hotel you can hear this into the night. And the doors to the balcony do not block out noise from the evening entertainment or the hotel next door (or the constant noise from the concrete breaker).  
The beach is further away than anticipated and is a slight hill on the way back and the hotel is more on the road than the seafront. 
While we understand renovations need to be done at some point, and appreciate they were doing this to improve the hotel-it had a big impact on our 4 night stay -there was a sign to say work was 11am -5pm, these times were not stuck to. Perhaps we had been given the room we payed for from the start my review would have been better. 
Having looked now at the bad reviews -I see they have done this many times to other guests"
"I booked a Superior room direct with the hotel three months before going. When I checked in I paid for 7 nights on half board and was handed a room keycard. I asked the receptionist if this was a Superior room. He said it wasn't but if I went back to reception the following day at midday, I will be upgraded to a Superior with sea view. I was not told why or given an apology. Unfortunately he lied. When I returned the next day I was abruptly told by the two female receptionist's that all the Superior rooms had gone and I should have returned around breakfast time. I was told to come back again the next day. This was unacceptable to me, especially as the room I was staying in was no.3106. It was really bad. Very small and hot ( there was a heatwave, it was over 90 degrees and the air conditioning was hardly working). The room had never been renovated since the hotel was built. There was no balcony and the view was of the 6 lane busy and noisy road. I had interrupted sleep all night because of the noise. 

The two female receptionist's told me to return later in the day to speak to the person that checked me in. I refused. I asked to speak to the Manager. I was told his office was around the corner. The manager wasn't there so I returned to reception. I was told he'd be back in 15 minutes, he wasn't. Someone else told me he'd be 5 minutes, he wasn't. All this time other guests were checking in and being given better rooms. I felt helpless so decided to find another property. I found one on Booking.com and went to
look at it only a 5 minute walk away. I went back to the Argana reception and told them I wanted a refund as I'd found a different hotel. I was told I had to return later and speak to the reception manager. I kept my calm but refused to return, I wanted a refund. The receptionist's whole attitude went from unhelpful and unpleasant to ""Wait a moment, Sir"". She tapped on her computer and told me she had a better room available if If like to take a look at it. I did and it was OK although not a Superior room with sea view. I accepted it. The situation was very stressful and ruined the holiday for me.

I discovered that this hotel constantly overbooks their Superior rooms. They do this because they have a free cancellation policy and guests don't have to pay until they arrive if they book direct with the hotel or Booking.com. They expect some guests not to turn up or cancel and when this doesn't happen they cause an overbooking situation. The day I arrived they had overbooked and 15 reservations didn't get the Superior room they had booked. 

The reception team are very skilled in delay tactics and excuses. The worst thing is they take your money and then tell you they do not have the Superior room you booked. 

Another point. On the hotel website and on Booking.com the hotel is described as being beachfront/by the beach. It isn't. It sits on a hill which is why there are distant views of the sea. It is a 5 -10 minute walk downhill and a 10-15 minute walk uphill, past other hotels, crossing two roads and passing, restaurants and shops to get to/from the promenade. Another 2 minutes along the beach takes you to the sunbeds with umbrellas which belong to the Argana and are free. (You need to show the room card given with your room keycard).

And lastly the hotel is very lively with music being played around the pool all day from 10am. Nightly entertainment around the pool from 9.30pm followed by their nightclub until 2am so don't expect a quiet, relaxing holiday. You'll undoubtedly hear noise from your room one way or another. I made a mistake going to this hotel but many people love it."
"Booked a 45m² family suite with living room and bed room for four people, but being given a small triple room with three single beds. Not being told about the downgrade during checkin process. Next day I talked to the reception at 7am. Being told to wait until day shift come at 9am. At 9am, the reception said they could give us back the family suite with no explanation given. Did not take the room as I would be checking out in 2 hours. Dishonest hotel I think."
"Avoid avoid avoid .. from the start their was issues we arrived Monday night and checked in where we had to pay *per day* for the safe (that we actually never got to use even after many trips to reciption) 

we wore then given a horrible tiny box  room room on the ground floor when we checked in  then there was the issue of trying to shower after traveling all day and the shower flooded the bathroom and the water was so cold we moved on from this saying we'd try sort something come morning and then the entertainment kicked off so after traveling for so long we got absolutely no sleep! My husband went straight to the front desk and told them that we need to be moved we had to wait till the following afternoon at 1pm  and we would be moving rooms .. we wore given a different room that thankfully we could find ourselves as previously the night before the man who helped us to our room would not leave without some form of money! 

All settled into our room we though our problems wore behind us .. FAR from it! Along- side VERY RUDE wait staff they wore very friendly with some of the people but other's  not so much I had an encounter where I asked for a table to be cleaned and I got told to just move! 

Whilst I returned from an afternoon in Agadir 
 filthy dirty glasses been left in my room from days before hand which I had left for the clearer to take away .. she rinised them and put them back! 
 the overall horrible smell and noise was absolutely horrendous and then their was the issue of staff just letting them selfs into your room very early in the morning and the severe lack of a do not distribute sign and anytime we asked for one we wore meet with rather funny looks. We now come to the issue of waiting two and half hours on food we ordered one day at the pool and when we eventually got served the food was absolutely frezzing. The morning day we wore due to leave we booked late check out as we had a spa day booked for the morning time now the first issue here is the time was changed without our knowledge and when we eventually got to use to spa I had booked a manicure and petticure alongside my massage and paid in full when booking little did they mention that if you wanted your nails pained whilst having said nail treatments you'd be paying extra! 
Later in the afternoon we finally got to check out and unfortunately the weather was miserable so the hotel opened there bad and the smell of the bar was absolutely AWFUL we ordered food in which we got food poisoning from this mixed with incompetent staff and absolutely diabolical amount of work needed they also don't mention the beggers outside of the hotel when you arrive that's basically harass you until you give them money I WOULD AVOID AT ALL COSTS"
"Oh dear. We arrived to be told our Superior room was not ready and put into a cramped and very dated room at the back if the hotel.
We were told to go to reception at midday next day and curtly told all the rooms went at 0900am.
The person on reception advised us that we can stay in our present room or move to another hotel if we can find one !..
Customer service ZERO.."
"This is a nice looking hotel, with on the whole good staff who work hard.
Currently undergoing construction, and the noise from that makes the holiday difficult to enjoy.
We were told on arrival that we were getting a ""premium"" room... right next to the construction works.  The shower didnt work so we got a room transfer to a much better room on 4th floor..  However, construction noise, and noise from some inconsiderate guests drinking late around the pool still affected sleep.  The new room was good and clean however.
Too many people in the hotel for the space availble.. its nice food and the staff are working hard, but the tables are cramped in and you can be queuing for a table for a while..
Decent enough location, 10minute walk down to the beach.
If you avoid this construction period, and get a good cheap deal (ours was cheap) then this will be ok.."
"I would never stay here again
 
Liked · Decent location, mostly very friendly staff all around the hotel, generally clean, decent breakfast if overcrowded

Disliked · A couple of the most unhelpful front desk staff I have ever encountered, truly awful wi-fi in most of the hotel making work close to impossible, penny pinching service charges, a funky bathroom smell, noise from both their own and nearby nightclubs until late, loud noise from internal works by day, and a failure to even acknowledge post stay communications"
"On arrival we were given two rooms with a 5ft sheet around the balconies due to building works on the ground floor to make a bigger patio area around the pool as sun loungers were grid locked together (so no space to move around the pool)! We had no view and were NOT told about this before our stay plus there were also crater size holes at the sides of the balcony making it a health and safety hazard to step outside especially for children and elderly. My Uncle is partially blind so this was very dangerous for him!

When asked to move rooms reception staff promised rooms overlooking the pool (bar side) 2 floors up the next day after 2pm once available.

 The next morning the manhole outside our rooms had been taken up and not put back properly therefore we had a foul smell throughout our rooms. After breakfast we returned to our rooms to find our towels had gone so could not have no shower (lack of towels was a problem with the hotel)!

When we returned at 2pm we were told that the rooms promised were now not available as residents had extended their stay and we were given rooms with the same view above the ones we had (so still looking over the concrete site with lots of drilling and banging)! We went back to reception and asked to be moved again as not only were we not getting the rooms as promised but staff had not listened  at all regarding the view and noise! The Reception staff were very rude and uninterested and the Manager insisted that this wasn’t building works (just work being carried out)!

The next room was round the side of the hotel looking over concrete buildings and were awful so went back again to reception.

The final room had mould around our door frames and the tiles in the bathroom and the taps didn’t turn off properly so constantly dripped plus the lighting for the main room worked intermittently but we were too tired to move again so put up with these ones as at least they had a bit of a garden view (back end) but were still looking at the derelict concrete buildings!

The Restaurant was free for all, lots of queues, the coffee machine was always broken. Fruit juices always ran out and were not topped up plus not enough napkins or knifes and forks to go around (daily)!

Bar around the pool always ran out of coke in glass bottles and cans and I went through the entire wine menu to order by the glass and was told I had to buy a bottle for myself which I didn’t want!

Overall we had a very negative experience of the hotel and would not return.

Only positive was the lovely patient porter who had to take our luggage back and forth to reception and the many rooms we were moved to. Nothing was too much trouble for him.

The animation team were also great. Very friendly, lots of activities and keen to get everyone to join in. They work really hard."
"Our room overlooked a building site with a sheet over the balcony to stop the awful view. We weren’t informed of this before hand.  Requested unhelpful rude reception staff and uninterested manager to move us as we felt this was dangerous and no light in the room.  We’re told we would have a room overlooking the swimming pool the next day but that didn’t happen. We were only there for 5 days. On the second day was moved to floor above the noisy building work. Finally exhausted was moved again, as unpacking the door opened and another couple came in saying we were in their room.  Apologised as the bed wasn’t big enough for 4 people. Reception’s fault again. Continually requested lack of towels and toiletries.  Breakfast was a free for all.  One bar was shut although the telly above reception advertised a happy hour,  sun beds too close no space to manoeuvre between them. Only upside was the animation team who were very friendly. Please don’t bother to respond, as I have heard so many lies from staff during my stay you will be wasting time as we won’t be returning."
"Just back from argana, very dissatisfied. 
Had pool view room ok but building work was going on the whole week , jack hammers ,jcb,drllling , cement mixing. Walls being knocked down , walls being built.!!!!. 
Dining was a bun fight. ! Breakfast never any dishes for cereal, no spoons, no butter, no saucers. One coffee machine to serve everyone not good enough. !!! Long queues. 
Evening meal very poor selection again had to ask surly staff for cutlery and serviettes. . Ended up eating out most nights even though we had had paid for half board. !!! 
Reception staff miserable and not friendly. No local information given out or available.. 
We loved Agadir and the beach but would not stop at this hotel again . Tui you need to pull your finger out . 
The only company with no information book or notice board in reception was the English version of tui , every other language was there !"
"This week was a cheaper fill in week in the sun instead of the five star Tikida Palace, down the road. It is advertised as a four star property and indeed it is not a three star and no where near a five star - I place it in the lower half of the four star range.
It is a premises of two halves. The room we occupied was a quiet balconied room with a huge comfortable bed and a lovely bathroom.  It had a safe which did not function and it had a 32 inch tv which also did not work. Freshly decorated but fitted with lower quality furniture.
The hotel was offered on TUI with a substantial discount.  It was not until our first day around the lovely pool that we realised why? There was major re-furbishment taking place between 11am and 5pm every day.  This consisted of jack hammers, sledge hammers, walls being knocked down and walls being built !  I could not believe it, but we are here so make the best of it.  Pool side staff excellent.
The restaurant was a freshly re-furbished and modern structure.  When one walked in for serving it was bright and clean and well laid out. Again a story of two halves. A massive salad selection which was great. I always prefer a soup starter and generally the soup was suited to my palate, which was just as well because there was only one choice of soup - ever. If you didn't like fish soup of parsnip soup, hard luck.
The choice of hot food in the restaurant was in six large up and over containers. Now I have a good tolerance of choice but in dish one for breakfast there was rice. In two fried onions. In three cherry tomatoes. In four cold hard boiled eggs in shells. In five ratatouille.  For breakfast??
Restaurant service was in my view poor.  The pace at which produce was replaced was very, very slow resulting in long queues.  When I dared to ask for top ups I was responded with what I was now getting accustomed to as the Moroccan shrug and grunt. We were down for breakfast later one morning, still only half way through service.  No cereal, no milk, no banana pieces and anyway no spoons to use.  I sought out the manager (dressed in suit) and to my astonishment his response was  the 'shrug' - but at least he didn't grunt and called me his friend. 
Finally in this tale of woe I am bound to mention the ability of the waiting staff to slice off the extra few dirhams from your bill.  The subtle fist full of change that is a few coins short.  This is all so tedious.
Why do the waiting/bar staff have to be so surly? In my view all this emanated from two issues. 1. Management inactivity.  2. Lack of training.
Anyway we have solved the problem, next visit to lovely Agadir will be to the Tikida RIU Palace. God how we missed it's quality and service."
"I'm really disappointed I'm having to write this review. We are currently halfway through our stay at thr Argana hotel. The waiters etc are lovely. The hotel is a little dated and is definitely not a 4 star hotel as one would perhaps be in Europe but we expected that. The main gripe is that there is a strong smell of sewage in our room which is gradually getting worse. We've spoken with reception who said 'all rooms are full' so nothing they are able to do. They suggested 'opening the window' .appreciate that it may be at full occupancy but it would be nice if they sent a handyman or even came to check it out themselves to see if there was anything they could do. It's just disappointing as we can't relax in the room and feel like no one really cares. Based on this alone I would come back nor would I recommend."
"Hello. We stayed at this hotel (which we have done on 2 previous holidays)from the 4th to 11th March. We paid for a superior room. The room we were given on the ground floor with a pool view backed straight onto building renovation work with tarpaulins and noise from jackhammers blocking any view. Reception staff were really unhelpfull, but stood our ground . We were told to go and see the hotel manager . It would have been easier to find Lord Lucan !. Eventually was given a room that was ok (which reception could have given us to start with).   The hotel staff  , the cleaners and waiters are helpful and friendly. The man who is in charge of the till in the pool bar is such a miserable , very ignorant person . You can be stood at the bar wanting to order , but he will just ignore you whilst he fannys about !.  I'm sure he would get better job satisfaction working in a funeral home. Then the day before we came home we went out for a short walk to the local shop and returned to find our sunbed towels had been pinched Apart from this all was well !"
"The hotel is nice and good location.
Staff were very unfriendly especially the reception staff and snack bar staff. Booked a superior room with Seaview but was thrown in a box room at the back of the hotel with no Seaview or balcony as per reservation. When we went to ask at the reception why we didn't get the room we reserved and paid for they all started talking in the local language some laughing and the lady we said didn't even bother to respond and her colleague came and told us there's no superior room with Seaview available. Horrible front office staff. Snack bar staff preferred serving Caucasian guests and for us (2 black ladies) they really really took their time.
Very friendly porters and the housekeeper we had was a very humble and friendly lady.
Chicha bar staff were all friendly and amazing especially Abdul.
I wouldn't recommend this hotel just because of the staff but location and cleanliness was good."
"This is not a four star hotel. Very noisy hotel. Loud music until very late from somewhere nearby. From the acoustic, you can hear people in the reception or stairwell at night. 5.30 am drunken people in the pool. 24-hour reception, no-one asked them to be quiet or refrain from using the pool. We later found out this hotel is known for being noisy, this I would agree. 

The restaurant is open at 6.30=10am for breakfast and 7-10pm for the evening meal. Food is very repetitive. No allergen labels, the restaurant manager will take you around and inform you what you can and can not have in accordance with your allergies. They did cook some separate things for me in the evening. But very limited if you have a gluten-free diet. I emailed the hotel before to check, and they said they could accommodate. I would disagree. We went for breakfast one morning at 6.30 am due to a trip. The restaurant opened late. They were still setting up. Omelette and eggs weren't ready until 7 am. 

The pool was freezing cold. There are plenty of sunbeds but not enough if the hotel is full. One day, they brought more chairs out. They do provide towels. 

Beach is close by. Free sunbeds with the hotel at slot number 12. Marina is about 20 minutes walk along the beach. 

Rooms are adequate. The bed was comfortable but not the pillows. Cleaned every day. There is no sign to put on your door to say you don't require cleaning or not to disturb. Two small bottles of shampoo and shower gel were provided but not replenished. Two small bars of soap. 

Small fridge in the room. No kettle or tea and coffee. Safe in the room, payable per night. Free wifi that is really bad unless you sit in reception. This is not a four star hotel. Very noisy hotel.

"I am currently staying at this hotel with my two children and husband. If you are looking for a loud, party hotel. It's this one! The karaoke doesn't stop until after 11pm and it's very loud and doesn't let you sleep. There is a club right next to the hotel which again, so loud until 2am. The staff are ok, mainly friendly because they want something. The evening staff member at reception, very moody. Definitely not suitable for young children. The rooms are ok, clean and decent. Reception area not so nice. Food is doable. However you have to pay for water, and pay for an ironing service as they don't provide irons! I won't be back here!"
"Recently had a 4 night B&B stay.  Hotel was lovely and clean but that where the praise ends.  Reception staff rude and uninterested.  No local information available.  Absolute manic at breakfast.

The room was dated, old cupboards with chipped and peeling paint work, room cold, was promised a heater that never arrived!!  Room was at the very far end of the hotel, had to walk over builders materials and tools that had been left out in the corridor, not very health and safety.  No tea or coffee making facilities in room and mini fridge frozen all shop bought drinks.

On a positive note, Agadir was wonderful, pity about the hotel."
"Oh my god worst customer service ever. We arrive 5 February 2 adults a 5 month and a 3 years old we arrive at night tired and exhausted and ask if we could get something for the kids since we book full board the staff he did not care and told us dinner is over and you have to buy in their bar.

Staff treat us poorly but other guests they treat like king because of money they are obsessed with getting tips never saw nothing like this is sad. They never say hello or even good morning but to other guest they were amazing. This is not hotel for family nothing to do kids club always closed beach is like 10 min and 2 big hills with buggy is a nightmare. They are not nice the staff only one was nice Mohamed Bonaime the rest forget about. Agadir is nice but this hotel is far from 4 stars only positive thing is the cleaners room cleans but they never put enough towels and also douche gel need to ask every day . The room is good big but also the noise IS HORRIBLE YOU DONT SLEEP   Their is a club next door is like you inside is so loud so if you like to relax with kids don’t go there.

For the full board. I advise you to go for all inclusive Agadir is not so cheap and the prices are pretty similar to Spain so all inclusive is better . Staff is slow rude you talk to them and they talk with each other in Arabic .I travel
A

"Rubbish and rude service!
 
Liked · Only the beach view makes me happy.

Disliked · Lots of things makes me unhappy!
1. On a day we arrived in the hotel, they gave us definitely not our room. It was a room with 3 beds with broken window, old smelly aircons, weird toilet, weird bidet. We need to pay to use safety box. 
2. They said come to reception after breakfast and we're back after finishing our breakfast around 9 am and the reception said the room wasn't prepared so we need to come back at 12.30pm. So we came back to reception at 12.30pm but it turned out that it still need 1 hour.
3. Onl day 4 they don't give us towels, bathrooms mat, and 1 pillow have no pillow sheet.
4. The last day (day 5) we were here, the restaurant opened late! We just able to had breakfast at 6.50 am
5. The other things that really ruined my mood was the airport transfer from the hotel to airport. I texted their service to change the time because we're just able to finish breakfast at 7.05 am. And we go to the reception to confirm about the changing time. And the driver was there, no smile and very rude af! Do you think you talk to a slave or what! I paid for your service. I know you have another guest to pick up but it's in the same airport! And the duration from hotel to airport was only approximately 30 minutes! You still have time to pick up another guest! You don't need to be rude! I will never ever use this service again! NEVER!

They pending my review on booking.com, only show good reviews there."
"Argana Hotel, seems modern and got plenty of free activities, such a yoga lessons, dance lessons, karaoke in the evening, nice bars and pretty good breakfast. Good location.

Disliked · My room was really outdated. The part of the furniture were coming off. No free tea or coffee inside as well as no kettle. Basically just a room no amenities at all . One glass for 2 people. If you choose this place check the matters. If you need to write something you need to get it from Reception (hotel is huge). Bathroom needs deep cleaning. Water leaking from both, sink and the shower. Try to use more water and the sink is blocked. Second day after cleaning, towels were not replaced. Asked at the Reception but no luck, asked Housekeeper I found in the corridor, the answer was 5 mins, even if they had it on the trolley, no comments. If you don't speak French or Arabic forget you can be understood. The answer for everything is YES, especially from the Bar/Sisha Bar staff, but I think they don't understand a word. I ordered quite pricey set of 6 beers, 24ml !!!/13.50 euro that was supposed to come with a set of snacks, asked 3 times for it, noting arrived. Paid in cash, no change given as well. While served and paid we were totally ignored, Needed to open beer bottles myself, no bottle opener provided.
As in Morocco you have to get your boarding pass printed they charge 2 euros for it. I printed mine, paid, but my roommate wanted to print in the morning at departure day. They wanted to charge as again as stating it was not paid, we lost almost 20 mints at the Reception and missed our breakfast as we had our airport taxi ordered already. Definitely, wanted to scam us.
Be aware it is not ALLOWED to bring any food or drink from outside, even if the choice in the bar is really poor. If you like melted ice-cream, that's the place where you will find it. 
Swimming pool, ice cold, you don't fly 4 hours south for that"
"We arrived at hotel at 3.30 to be told we had to wait 40 minutes as our room was not ready. Check in at 4pm. We went back at 4.30 to be told we had to wait another hour. No apology. No offer of a drink nothing. 
We later when back at 5.30 and was given our room. By now we have spent 40quid in drinks as they are not cheap. 
Room was OK. Clean 2 single beds (asked for double) 
The reception staff are disrectful and very unhelpful. 
I asked to speak to manager, no mangers to speak too.
Food is awful not great choice. 
Don't feel safe in this hotel as they are always staring angrily. 
We have had no running water a few times in room.
We wanted to change hotels but are unable to. 
STAY AWAY"
"Before you read my review of this hotel you should know I have been abroad on average twice a year for 30 years. All over the world. I have cheap but excellent holidays and expensive but rubbish holidays but overall I'm a believer in you pay for what you get. 
First of all the good. Attractive looking, very clean, staff were some of the best iv ever seen. The private beach was clean and managed well keeping the sales people away from you.  We had an amazing new year's Eve where they pulled out all the stops. 
Now the bad. 
1. The food was average and kept running out. Also there were huge queues for the food and sometimes a table. 
2. The club next door plates loud music until 2am. You can't ignore it.
3. The drinks are over priced 
4. This is the worst one the pool is beyond cold. So cold in fact that nobody is ever in it. I went in once and found it painful it was so cold. Can't have much of a holiday without a pool. 

As I said you pay for what you get and this holiday was very cheap and I could ignore the average food and the lack of it but I can't ignore the loud music and the cold pool.."
"The website of this hotel is totally miss informing the public . I could list lots of things but the main one is the very poor selection of food in the restaurant.  Their web page was the reason i booked this hotel . TOTALLY DISSATISFIED 1OO%"
"My stay at this hotel was a complete letdown from start to finish. I booked a room for two nights, but upon arrival, I was shocked by the poor quality of the accommodation. The room was in a dismal state, with worn-out furniture, no carpet on the floor, and the lack of basic toiletries like shampoo or soap was unacceptable.

Despite reaching out to the reception for a room change, my request fell on deaf ears. They did nothing to improve my situation. Determined not to endure another night in such conditions, I decided to leave prematurely. At that point, the hotel promised a refund, but unfortunately, it was a blatant lie.

months has passed since my departure, and I still haven't received the agreed-upon refund. This experience has not only been a financial loss but also a source of considerable frustration. I strongly advise against trusting this hotel, as they fail to keep their promises and disregard their customers. I intend to file a complaint with the relevant authorities, armed with all the necessary evidence."
"What they don’t mention is the night club located right under the hotel, I couldn’t sleep at all cause the music was on the whole night. When I went to the desk they played dumb and didn’t help me at all. Worst hotel experience ever. And the airco didn’t work."
"Where do I start!! I thought I'd book this hotel after seeing mix reviews as alot of them were good compare to the bad but I should have listened I'd definitely learnt from this holiday.

If you have booked a standard double room you are going to be in for a lovely surprise the bath had mouldy spots on the walls and corners. What was shocking there is a door in your room which connects to your neighbours room.
The room had an very strange old musky smell to it. 

I had gone on holiday with 2 of my nephews an wife and the room that was given to them was 10 times worse then mine as it stank of sewage in the whole room it was that bad that as soon you go near there room you could smell it on the outside into the corridor. An the entire bedroom After we went down to restaurant to have dinner which we could not stomach so we literally googled the closet take away to us and went out to mcdonalds which was a 5 minute walk down the road, heaven sent so glad for that because the next 8 days it was our spot for dinner.
when we got back the smell was so over bearing that we had to go downstairs and complain to the night staff who didn't seem too be bothered we were told sleep there for one night and tomorrow morning we shall upgrade your rooms  its like they knew that room smells of sewage as i tryed explaining to one of the guy the other one spoke an said yhyh we will get you air freasher to spray which he didn't because the next morning I asked my nephews did they come with the spray he said no.

Location: you better pack some ear plugs on holiday if you think you are going to get some sleep you might aswell think again because the music does not stop till 2/3am and no matter what you do you can hear it as If the music is outside your room the first night I had to drown out the music sound by putting the TV on loud until I fell asleep. They also have night clubs on either side, which added to the music and bass.

Room: after complaing the second day in morning we was upgraded to a much better room. Room 101 an room 103 was much more cleaner and the bathroom was spotless  with no smell in the room but for some odd reason the sewage smell was still present in room 101 only in the bathroom luckily it wasn't seeping into the room so we made sure we kept the door closed.
to think we would have got away from the music we was located right above the speakers and the dj! But we thought suck it up because it was million time better then the first rooms given to us.
Also because room 101 was the first room located on the ground floor it was right next to a tunnel way that people use all night to go in and out to go to the shisha or the bar and that really disturbs you when you got people talking shouting in the middle of the night it sounds as if they are in your room. Strangly  a weird loud dragging construction sound was coming from upstairs in middle of the night on an off on occasions which woke me up a couple times a week.

Food: you best have a sweet tooth because the only thing that is nice in the hotel is the cakes and pastries other than that you are better of eating out because God damn the food that was served to you is worse then ready made meals so bland and disgusting we had to live on eating out for 7 days apart from having breakfast which was decent as you can have an omelette an pan cakes an stuff

Staff: it's a shame the only thing good about the place is the staff members the 2 receptionist murium and Kalima on the morning shift were so polite and kind and truly went out there way to help you and resolve any problems we had
There was also an old waiter he was kind of bold he was so polite and friendly it's a shame I didn't ask his name.

Ironing service: can not believe you do not get an iron to iron your clothes yourself you have to pay to use an in house ironing service which is a money making scheme the service was a joke we had to chase after them to come give us a form to fill to get our clothes ironed on many occasions the reception would ring them with no answer and say we will send someone to you but no one would come till we would have to go back down an wait in the reception area
 

Wifi: awful. I couldn't even make a video call to connect with family and friends. The only place you can get a good signal is in the reception, which was superannoying.

Finally the cleaning: The girls were so polite and cleaned the rooms to a high standard.

Overall: this hotel is not a 4* hotel in my eyes it needs alot of improvement in order to state this, which is really misleading."
"On arrival at hotel around 11.30 pm despite having paid for Seaview apartment with balcony/terrace we were given what I can only describe as a room from the 1960s, one window overlooking building site and busy road. Broken bed. No balcony. We were told we will get a new room the following morning. Morning arrived and we were woken up to drilling and hammering from every side of room. Horrendous!! Thankfully we eventually received a much better updated room with lovely pool view. We advised fridge wasnt working so two maintenance guys arrived, they spent 2hours going through plug sockets etc. Eventually they got fridge to work but knocked out half the rooms electrics. Hotel is very noisy from pool entertainment and then nightclub next door that goes on until after 3am. So not for someone looking for a relaxation holiday. Hotel is advertised as beach front. It's a good 15 to 20 minute walk to beach!
Restaurant and cleaning staff are all lovely. Reception staff not so friendly. We were there for quake which was scary for both staff and Hotel guests. There didn't seem to be much direction from hotel management regarding health and safety measures. "
"We stayed here in August 2023 for 6 nights. One of the rooms had no air conditioning. Both rooms had no electricity on 3 occasions and no water ( sink and shower) for 3 days on/off.
We were late for breakfast and excursions due to no water / showers.
The waiters for breakfast were really slow and we had to ask for cutlery many times each morning.
Reception staff unhelpful
Worst hotel I stayed in 25 years"
"Horrible 
Start with the good things 
The staff are very nice and polite.
Bad,worst hotel I ever stayed in.too much noise because there is a bar nearby,false advertising. Old rooms,average buffet,I was very disappointed.you have to pay extra money for the drinks. I felt like the hotel wanted more and more money out of the guests in every way possible.they ruined my holiday.
Don't waste your time and money to go there.it should be 2 Star Hotel, not  4.is a big scam"
"Disappointing overall. Staff are unfriendly and abrupt to non French speaking guests. There's a lovely pool but the poolside bar has very bad service and yet to get an order right. Entertainment at night overly loud and music by the pool can only be described as agony to listen to. Food mediocre at best. Not recommended for Irish guests. "
"The quality is poor, the buffet was normal and the croissants were low quality, too much noise because there is a bar in the nearby, the only good thing in that hotel was the animation only. The hotel is normal and doesn’t worth it there many hotels better "
"Worst hotel ever!! We arrived Wednesday morning @11am we were told that our rooms are not ready and that we need to wait till 3pm. We didn’t get an explanation all we were told was that this is normal in Agadir and no hotel room is available before 3pm.( THIS IS NOT TRUE BECAUSE I BEEN TO AGADIR BEFORE AND NEVER HAD AN ISSUE) Staff ignored us during lunch time because we wanted to get a table cleaned finally after 20 minutes someone cleaned a table but by that time our food was cold. This could happen almost every time we went down to eat. Breakfast is nice but the same every morning. When we were leaving we asked the guy behind reception to print our tickets out because they do no accept e tickets at the airport we were sat in reception for an hour because he served someone before us even though they arrived after us. We didn’t say anything because by that time we were tired of arguing everyday! We waited to see what he would do but he continued to check other clients in and ignored us.  We went up to reception again to ask him when he will print it out only for him to tell us we need to
come back in the morning.  Someone claiming to be the manager then got involved and said we are sorry but come back in the morning. We refused to leave and explained we need our
ticket now. He apologised again and told the receptionist to print it out for us who
continued to ignore us. (SURELY THE MANAGER WOULD DO IT) we waited for another 30min and approach the receptionist to ask about the ticket that needed to be printed he ignored us again. The manager then walked back in and we told him the receptionist has not printed the ticket. He asked him again and just walked off and sat in lobby talking to people. We got our ticket printed an hour later! I can go on and on about the hotel! The hotel ruined our experience SO KEEP YOUR MONEY AND BOOK ELSEWHERE!!! I have attached picture of the rude receptionist "
"Not as advertised AT ALL.
Only one pool and it’s out of use a lot of the time due to kids activities, no private balcony and NOT full board at all - all drinks had to be paid for - including water - we had been told it was only alcohol we had to pay for. WiFi didn’t work properly and nor did safe & patio doors didn’t lock so not at all secure.
Food was bland and restaurant not big enough for hotel at full capacity (& it was for some of the time we were there despite it being during term time) so long wait for food - not helped by the restaurant not opening on time most days.
Rooms were not clean - see photos (stained sheets & pillowcases upon arrival/ curtains falling down & stains on sofa) - whole place in great need of refurbishment.
First 24 hours we tried 4 times to see the manager to no avail- in the end we messaged the property with photos of our unclean room - on the 3rd day they moved us to a better room with a private balcony but the staff still come in your room (even if you have a no disturb sign on your door or if you are asleep) & remove the towels between 8.30-9.30am….but don’t bring clean ones before midday?? One night we were woken up by the front desk at 1am to give us clean towels ? Utterly bizarre.
But the worse thing was the noise - it starts at the pool before midday and gets cranked up every hour…until 23.00pm when the kids activities (finally) stop…by this time you cannot have a conversation in your room as it’s so loud outside.
We have never left a hotel in such desperate need of a good night’s sleep."
"I travelled from Dominican Republic until Egypt(all Egypt)and i don't have this experience never.
We can start with the good thing's.
Good position of the hotel.Nice room and bathroom,at 4 foor with vews .
Cleaning lady very nice and polite.
BAD:ceck in:desaster-one young boy and 6 quest(cannot handel)
He want to change my room without asking i say no,i want my room with sea vews.
Ok,it is noise from the swimpool or the club right next  us but that is(we nob't come to the sanatory,i can understand)
Wat i cannot understand is:
ATTENTION-at the full board drink not included,need to pay THE WATER..and a bottle is 2 euro(in supermarket 0.50euro)
You will te me so what-ok but they have announcement everywhere is not alowd to bring food and drink from outside so are you gorce to buy from them(that think's for me is not ok at 4*hotel).
Breakfast-the same-the cooking had din't have the imagination.
Lunch and dinner-the meat have a dubious colour
2 or 3 think''-very poor 
Fruit(watermelon,melon,apple,peach)  cuted in small pieces-????in Marrocco,country with fruit and vegetable to put in your had..
Divertisment program-a think for the peiple to don't say they have nothing.(i have a mouvie for children program)..  
Atitude of the management -desaster.
However,THE FIRST AND LAST TIME IN THIS HOTEL!!"
"
I feel like people should know the TRUTH about this hotel, reviews I read seemed all good but I was highly disappointed and so were many others here I spoke to. 
As I’ve got here, the hotel just look so run down and nothing like the pictures at all. There was building Once we arrived, I knew I had to pay tax as I’ve done so in most countries I’ve been to, but they charge me over 500 Moroccon dirham which I thought was a rip-off. Especially because when I arrived , they told me my room wouldn’t be ready until 3 pm that day. I arrived at 11am. I was annoyed because I had been travelling from the night before and I really needed a shower but I understood. I do think they need to come up with some sort of plan to accommodate people who arrive in the morning/afternoon instead of making them wait for a room they’ve paid for. I went to reception at 3 and asked if my room as ready as me and my children were falling asleep from being awake all night and morning and the cleaners hadn’t even started on my room yet, at this point I’d been waiting 4 hours and I was told another 45 minutes. Heavily disappointed I chose this hotel for my weeks stay.
So currently in the room at 15.40, and the safe doesn’t work. Kinda needed that. The doors look like they’re falling off & the sink in the bathroom looks like it’s coming apart. The front door wobbles. 
The wifi is despicable. Cannot reach most rooms and seems to constantly cut off. 
My husband told a few clients at the hotel that there was a shop around the corner that I did exertions for half the price, and that the exertions guy in the hotel (in attached picture) was ripping everybody off and the guy behind the exertions desk grabbed my husband on the arm really hard, and my husband told him to never put his hands on him again, but for the simple fact that we paid so much to stay at the hotel, and this is what the customer services like is despicable. 
The manager was really nice and did upgrade us but we still didn’t enjoy our stay and will not definitely be returning.
I don’t know whether it’s bedbugs or mosquitoes bite me, my daughter and husband have bites everywhere. 
When my husband asked for a hairdryer, he got told three times they would bring it up. This was over a six hour period. eventually, my husband had to go down at around 11 pm and said he was not leaving until he was given a hairdryer and the guy behind reception said that the plugs in our room is not working when they definitely were , he also was really rude to him and the security guard had to get involved. I have been to Agadir before and it was amazing, but this time has made me never want to go back. The hotel restaurant staff were amazing. A lot of rude French people. "
"The day we got there they had overbooked our room,we got sent to a disgusting back streer backup hotel,didnt include our meals at that place,we got tyere at 1pm we was back n forth from the hotel they put us in to argana for food etc…so many famies were sent to this 1 star disgusting hotel as fully booked baring in mind we booked in december and went in may…the next morning we took our things bk to argana and they didnt book us im till 2pm..2 days wasted right there in the struggle of getting into argana…toilet paper is hardly given until you ask and even then they give 1 roll amongst 3 of us…one security guy was really really rude to my children…would never book again…food is near enough the same everyday so we paid all inclusive yet paid to eat out nearly every day….total crap regarding the over bookings for money,no thought for the tired guests arriving with small children then hsving to move luggage back n forth from other hotels…alot of change needs to be made regarding the overbooking issuesp"
"I have stayed at this hotel previously and left great reviews. However this trip was very different and after 2 weeks I moved out to the hotel next door which is much better. 
The front of house staff here are delightful, particularly Karima. However staff on the pool bar/ cafe are inexperienced and need training. They also kept running out of wine. I had one pizza lunch  here which was dreadful. 
Breakfast is good. 
I was allocated one of the refurbished rooms with a sea view. It looked great, although the bathroom was tiny - as I was staying  solo, that didn't really matter. Some service issues with room which wasn't cleaned one day, Toiletries were not replaced and I ran out of toilet paper twice. 
The safety deposit box didnt work. The towels were grey and had many threads hanging off them. 
Sadly it is currently more of a  building site that a hotel- they are working at different sites within the hotel and grounds, and it is impossible to avoid loud building work from 10am to 7pm. Rooms are being completely refurbished - doors and windows and flooring and bathrooms. Consequently lots of drilling and banging.
They are also replacing the 2 lifts-- one was out of service and will be for quite some more time. The other is new but went out of service at least three times during my stay- but was quickly  repaired. Waiting times for the lift were unacceptable. 
They were also building a large wooden structure in the gardens. Consequently, 6 days of heavy electric stapling going on ! 
I think they tried to drown out some of the building noise by playing  loud music from 9.30 onwards. It didn't work and  the music itself became very irritating ! 
After dark the noise from the pool  bar / cafe is totally unacceptable, as they ramp up the music until 11pm or later. Twice a week they have karioke which really is horrendous- so so load. Terrible voices. Mainly French songs. It really was so bad but they refused my requests to turn the sound down- there only suggestion at 11pm was to move rooms- but that included packing and removing all my clothing , too - so hardly  acceptable ! I thought they were just giving me a quiet room to sleep in , but no ! 
The Internet quality is very poor. It comes and goes even in reception! Do not expect to get connection in your room. Most guests form a huddle in reception to gain an Internet connection.
Finally, the pricing. I paid about £40 per night for this hotel for a 2 week booking and a separate 1 week booking. I tried to book for the 4th week but was quoted over €150euros per night ! What ? No way is this  even a  €100 per night hotel!! In any event I cancelled and moved out after 2 weeks - that was the worst 2 weeks I have ever had in a hotel ! 
MY advice. Do not stay here!! Please look at photos. "
"Never again .the whorse hotel ever.Avoid if you are Smart .FOOD IS HORIBLE.INTERNET NOT WORK,TV ONLY FREE CHANELS AND ONLY NEWS,IF YOU NEED TOWELL ON POOL YOU NEED TO PAY.NOT EVEN TAP WATER IT S FREE,VERRY EXPENSIVE,YOU NEED TO BEG FOR TOYLET PAPER,YOU CANT SLEEP AT ALL VERRY NOISEE.,THE ONLY GOOD THING S ARE THE LADYS FROM RECEPȚION.NOT RECOMEND NOT EVEN TO MY ENEMISE🤮🤮🤮🤢🤢🤢"
"I have just come back from staying at Argana Hotel and it was the worst hotel we have ever stayed in. Never have I ever looked for flights home whilst been on holiday, until this one.

 When we arrived we was not told by the booking provider or hotel when checking in for that matter that there was building work going on in the hotel, no warning nothing. We was woken up to banging and drilling most mornings at 8am and even when around the swimming pool you could hear it over the music (pictures and videos attached). If we would have been warned then ok but we had nothing. The bar staff through the day and night was very very rude, never have I been on holiday and felt this way. One day they had no change to give me and said they would give me it later, 6 hours later I went to get my change and said I will get an ice cream with it instead which they groaned and grunted acting like they did not owe me anything and was reluctant to let me until I took the ice cream out the fridge. Another day I asked for a glass with ice but was told they had no ice (red hot country with no ice), literally no lie 3 minutes later seen a lady with ice in her drink. They could have just said I will go get some I won’t be a minute and I would have had no problem with it. At the pool bar they charge 25 dirham for a can of sprite or 20 dirham for a bottle of sprite which  I asked for a bottle but was told they had none. I said the restaurant have bottles as I had just had one when eating dinner and they said it was a different bar …. I left it because I didn’t want to argue and knew they just wanted more money from me so I paid for a can. Later in the holiday we asked for two glasses from the bar and she said they don’t have any as they are all being used in the restaurant but yet it “is a different bar”, I knew full well it wasn’t. This then lead us to not spend anymore money at the hotel and took our own drinks, the money isn’t the issue it’s the principle. One day I asked if we could watch a game of football on the tv in the bar one lady said yes and to come back when it started. I went back at the time of the game and the rest of the girls said no and was unable to work the tv and they had to get a technician to turn it over, never in my life have I heard anything so stupid! But I waited for the technician and apparently he did not know how to turn it over either haha, unbelievable if you ask me. The hotel is not for English/British people they are very rude to most English/British people not just us as I heard them being rude to others. 
We sat at the bar one evening for one hour without anyone asking us if we wanted anything or wanted a drink but other people around was asked and served at their table. We got up and left as it’s damn right rude. 

Enough of the staff let’s get onto the half board situation. Food was HORRENDOUS again not aimed at British people which yes we understand that it won’t be all the time but they never had chips, they had stale pizza (shown in photos) which had no topping on. I resulted in eating bread most nights (shown in photos) I didn’t take money to spend on food when I had already paid for half board. There was not enough stations or food variety for the amount of guests. Breakfast time you had to wait 10 minutes for clean cups, mugs, plates and cutlery as they was running out constantly, it was a massive battle to get anything. Queues at the stations was huge because they took soo long. Drinks at breakfast was hit and miss, the drinks machine didn’t always work and then you was left with water or a hot drink which I do not like so that resulted in me going 5 days without any drink from the hotel when I had paid for half board. I mentioned this to the waiters every day but they always said they can’t speak English and had absolutely no solution for me, I then spoke to the reception and they said they would speak to the restaurant…. Again no solution. To make it even worse, though we was half board we had to still pay for evening meal drinks, so it wasn’t half board at all. We felt like the hotel was just wanting more and more money out of guests in every way possible, this was not just our view as other guests thought the same after speaking to them. I have spent more money on food and drink this holiday than I have done on a self catering holiday. 

I suggest not going as you will be disappointed or go with a tonne of money that you want to just spend on keeping hydrated and fed.

Tip: go to the shop as 1l of sprite is 6.50 dirham whereas a can of sprite in the hotel is 25 dirham and I get they need to make a profit but bloody hell that is shocking, god help the family’s with children. 
Also 1.5l of water in the shop is 5 dirham but at the hotel it is 20 dirham for 1l
Even a packet of cigarettes in the shop is cheaper than a can of sprite at the bar. 

Only positive to the hotel is that the entertainment staff, lifeguard, security and the camera man was very polite and welcoming and the rooms are clean regularly. 

I AM UNABLE TO UPLOAD VIDEOS OF THE NOISE WE WAS WOKEN UP TO. "
"We paid extra for a superior room, which had the sea view as we expected. The room was very clean and the bed was comfortable.
All of the staff were very friendly, and helpful.
The food was average, but ok, but didn’t expect pizza( hand made) 3 nights out of 7
The negative points were, cupboard skidding door fell off hitting my wife’s shoulder, it was a heavy door.
Patio doors to the balcony hard to open and didn’t close properly.
The noise from the pool bar is ridiculously loud, and goes on till 1/2 am you will not get to sleep before then.
We had to down grade our room to get away from the noise. We ended up without a sea view , however it was slightly quieter.
During the day they also have music blaring out from the poolside.
This is definitely a family holiday, not for couples wanting to relax."
"Avoid!!! Is not how is showing on the  pictures!!! Wi-fi is not working properly, door neither, shower is missing!!! Is a big scam everything ,totally different with what it was advertising ! Avoid as much you can ❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️ "
"Absolutely terrible hovel,like a horror movie,dirty,smelly,horrendously dark long, corridors,food basic,noise was crazy,building work every where,lifts don't work ,stayed 1 night then left,found a new hotel,didn't even  tell them we were leaving .staff were lovely tho."
"I had the most terrible stay. I made a reservation the same day I have checked in because of medical circonstances and I just needed some quiet place to lay my head for couple of days. 
The reviews here were good so I made the reservation. 
But apparently they have been constructing the hotel and they put people inside the rooms just next to those construction and they gived a good price called ""holidays offers""!! Without any notice in advance and no refund!!!! Scammers !!!!

Plus they were no hot water.

Eventually, I told them I'm moving to another hotel because of this and all they respond  was ""yes it is disturbing..."" they didn't even bother to apologize or trying to find me another room.

The only good thing in this hotel was that some of the staff were very friendly and helpful.

Would definitely not recommend! "
"Yeah the drilling and hammering at 8:30 in the morning was terrible. No communication to us from the hotel that it was happening right on top of our room. Makes it hard to relax and sleep in, especially after a long day.
Otherwise seems like a family friendly hotel, guess they are just putting in works before busy season, but regret staying there. Wish I read other reviews. Also wifi is pretty much non existent"
"Do not even by mistake book this Hôtel absolutely disgusting. No care for there guests especially in Ramadhan when people are sleeping late. We had six separate rooms booked and were supposed to be back after two weeks but we will definitely not be staying here.

They don't have the decency to atleast move your room before they start drilling and hammering right outside your room at 8:30am!

I would never recommend this hotel to anyone and would never book this even if it was the last hotel in Agadir!"
"Not a good experience 

1. We came quite early so we had to wait till 3p.m. After a looooong wait Our room was ready at 4:30 p.m, they gave us a key and told to go in the room after a half an hour… 
2. Room wasn’t very clean. The floors wasn’t mapped. Every time you close the WC door, there was some plaster falling from the ceiling
3. There were looooots of people so you usually have no space to lay near the pool. 
4. After a housekeeper cleaned our room she left it unlocked with all our stuff… 
5.  We had all inclusive package - but we needed to pay for any drinks (even water), we booked in booking but there was no information about it. 
6. Hotel builders were so loud with the construction noises
7. Wifi is more then TERRIBLE! Not worked in the room, sometimes worked in lobby. 

Although, food was not bad, hotel is near the beach and that was good. Some staff was friendly (lovely security man) :)"
"Service is terrible , no hangers in the wardrobe , no kettle, glass nothing . U have to pay for iron your closes . It’s just simple things that hotel have this one don’t , literally u have to pay for everything. No one Speaks English French only . I wouldn’t say it’s a 4 star hotel ."
"Such a shame as we were having a lovely stay at this hotel - unfortunately I wouldn’t go back. The hotel is clean, the rooms are basic but fine (for the price). However there is an issue with the hotel & booking.com. The price you see on booking.com is not the price you pay at the hotel. Top tip, pay on booking.com not at the hotel!!!! My friend paid when she arrived at reception not the quoted reserved price, as this was a mistake but a higher rate which was ok, as it was still very reasonable. When I went to check out (she had already left) I was told there had been another mistake & there was further money to pay. I was confused by this & also the very confrontational manager who told me that I had lots of money & if I didn’t pay the staff on reception would have to pay- also why had they left it until I checked out to rectify this mistake - we had been in the hotel for 4 days !!! Whilst my friend was on the phone to booking.com back in Ireland - I was then taken to a further manager who basically raised his voice at me - as I didn’t see why I should pay this further additional cost, as surely this is an issue with hotel & booking.com. I left his office feeling quite intimidated & upset!!! I paid the further additional charge, as I had no choice & we are now taking it up with booking.com. But as a customer of this hotel, I would not have expected to be treated in this manner & the issue over the room rates is between the hotel & booking.com & not the customer. The rest of our party that had paid the same rate but on booking.com did not get this problem!!!! Shocking customer service & would not be expected to be treated in this manner. There were 7 of us in our group & we would have all returned to the hotel up until this point!!!"
"Many of the “glowing” reviews are false.  They lie about who the manager is.., and when they will be available to speak to.., constantly saying, “he has just left”.., or “at”lunch”.

When asked to describe what the manager looked like.., they couldn’t tell us.  The manager is now available, we were told.  Taken up.., no one in the room.  Then eventually, when we pursued our complaints, we were threatened with the police."
"Giving 1 start cause 0 is not allowed 
I have been there with 4 other friends, our room didn’t have Wi-Fi connection, the sink was blocked and the bathroom was full of flies! 
The first day we get into the room and we were missing a towel, took them a whole hour to give it to us, even tho we went asking for it at the reception 4 times, the second day we come back and we were missing 2 towel, another hour to give it to us! Two guys came to check both days if we were missing it wasting time and making us lose our restaurant reservation. 
When I asked to speak to a manager, they were always changing his/her starting time, making it sound like they were all lying to us.
Wrote them an email to ask for a refund and no one is replying still. 
Also, it is a family hotel, but kids running and shouting all over the place is unacceptable! 
Worst hotel of my life!!! !"
"Terrible place, went in Jan/Feb 2023 and completed shocking as its not family friendly at all, they aren't bothered if the room is missing basic toiletries or the tv not working, will always send you away saying someone will come but no one ever does.
Honestly I hope you pick somewhere else and not ruin your holiday for you and your family like I did."
"I sent my review directly to the hotel before I posted online to give feedback and an opportunity to respond but recieved no reply.

We have just returned home and unfortunately were disappointed as the hotel did not meet out expectations. Some of the staff were fantastic but the manner of others and the presentation of parts of the hotel lets it down. 

Our room was grubby and not what you would expect from a 4 star junior suite. There was a hair in the shower on the wall when we arrived and it was still there when we left. The shower head was disgusting and needs replacing as does the area under the sink. The drain smelt like urine from the second last day. The Wi-Fi worked 2 from 4 days. While the room was clean it was not to good standard with dust in corners and marks on floor. The sheets also had marks. 

Some of the front desk staff were rude and did not make you feel welcome. Also you should have contacted before our stay to let us know the haman was not working. 

On the positive the ladies at breakfast were lovely and the young gentleman who works in the indoor bar upstairs with his wife was very friendly and helpful.

Unfortunately I would not recommend Argana to friend and family travelling to Agadir."
"Arrived at this hotel,and were put into a room that was terrible,old furniture, all scrached,
shower was all black mould, patio doors hard to open, not what we had paid for.complained at the reception that we had paid for a superior room.we were told that we would be moved the next day, which we did at 2pm. we spoke to some of the guests, who said they had the same experience. the reception staff were not very friendly, I would not recommend this hotel."
"On arrival, we were forced to pay the hotel £115 as the tour operator Love Holiday hadn’t settled their bill with the hotel. This was eventually sorted the next day after multiple communication with the tour operator but it took over a week to process the refund from the hotel but £25 short of the amount paid. Not a good start. Then the noise! We had paid extra for sea view but this overlooks the pool bar and an outdoor nightclub next door. Earplugs required. 
We were full board. Another mistake. The food was buffet style and not very varied or appetising. Breakfast was bedlam. We both had a bout of Gastro illness and stopped eating at the hotel after 3 days. 
On the positive side the staff were friendly and helpful and the room was clean. It was a cheap week away in the winter sun but not a restful one. I won’t be returning."
"Cheap hotel with rather tired decor especially in the lower floor rooms.  Main problem is the staggering level of noise. In fairness much of this is due to the adult only hotel next door which blares out music until 3 or 4 in the morning.  Nonetheless this was the noisiest hotel I have encountered in 40+ years of travel.  If the relatively cheap deals attract you bring your earplugs and a sense of humour. "
"It's true, that you get what you pay for. If you book a room in Argana hotel avoid the rooms with sea view, or you won't sleep very well. I would recommend this place for those people who wants to go party every day, definitely not for people who wants to relax.
We booked bed and breakfast but we had to wake up around 6.30 every day to avoid the crowd in the restaurant, won't lie but from around 8 or 9 o'clock there was no place to sit down, no cups to drink coffee, and had to wait for food as well.
It's close to the beach which is good, 5 mins from McDonald's if you're tired of eating the same breakfast every day, and it's about 30 mins from the big Market, where you can buy some local handmade souvenirs and stuff.
We spent some time in Chicha bar at the hotel, that was good, they offer drinks and you can try sisha there.
We also tried the massage with my partner. I wouldn't say the massage therapist I got was professional in any way. I would say she just poured some oil on me and touched me in inappropriate places, haven't done any massage at all. A complete waste of time and money.
So all in all we are a bit disappointed, but it was cheap so shouldn't complain too much I guess."
"Public areas are nice and welcoming and staff are very friendly and hard working . 
Sadly this hotel is so badly run it is hard to know where to begin . We stayed for 3nights on a half board basis and the hot food was cold every night . This is really sad as the standard of food is good . The restaurant is chaotic with not enough seating , crockery or cutlery to go round . On our 3rd night we attempted to discuss our concerns with management who sadly don’t seem to care that they risk giving an entire clientele food poisoning . 
Don’t be fooled by the look of this hotel or the misleading reviews . 
Severely disappointed and have now moved to a much cheaper but better managed hotel nearby . "
"The staff were very polite and helpful. However we booked 3 rooms with sea view, we were given 3 rooms facing a closed down hotel.  The rooms had no Coffee / tea maker as per ad. The TV had only one English Channel, BBC world news.  The rooms had a stinking smell coming out of the bathroom.  The towels were stained, No hot water for the duration of our staying, despite of complaining many times about the hot water, we got no where.  The furniture in the rooms were damaged and old. 

The breakfast was a shambles, we had to wait for clean plates, glasses and cups as there were not enough for the amount of guests at the hotel.  The safe in the rooms are chargeable 20 dirham per day and the gym is 50 dirham per hour. We would never stay at this hotel again. "
"This was the first time in Morocco.
The hotel is in a good  location  and the majority of the staff are very friendly 
The hotel needs a lot of modernisation. The rooms that we were allocated
Was nothing like those advertised on their website 
The room we had was very outdated. There is no coffee or tea facilities within the room no chairs on the balcony, so I had to ask for those when they arrived. They were dirty. Shower was over the bath which was the only thing you could use as a tap doesn’t work to fill the bath up
The walls between each room are very thin, and you can hear everything !!
That your neighbours are talking about or doing !!! 
The crockery in the restaurant is old and cracked or chipped and some of the classes are cracked as well
Not good"
"check in was pretty simple. we travelled as a group of four. two couples. we were never placed near each other. the first rooms was old looking, dark, furniture was rotting, room smelt like mold which i complained as i am pregnant, air conditioner in that room was pointless. they couldnt move us that same day but the next day we went back and they kindly changed us into a nicer room that has been recently refurbished. there was still work to be done. whenever you used the shower, it would spread all over the bathroom floor as the shower glass had a piece of wood next to it that was rotting. didn’t understand the purpose of that. we had to sleep with the bathroom light extractor on because it would smell like rotten egg in the bathroom after a while. 
sea view rooms are not sea view at all. they put you facing walls by the looks of it unless you are french. no point paying extra for “sea view”
i would recommend tipping the maids. i tend to be an observer of people and this lady (no idea her name was) worked fast and spot on.  we would leave a note with money so she knew it was hers to take. 

we had full board but barely ate at the restaurant at the hotel. it was always a headache to get plates. food is pretty bland. they cook for quantity, not quality by the looks of it. i caught food poisoning fourth day in from an omelette that was uncooked but i did not realise until it was too late so we started going out to eat. they stop you from bringing food and drinks in from outside wanting you to spend money at the small restaurant they have in there. you can imagine after having food poisoning you really don’t want to eat anything there and you get weird cravings being pregnant. 
they apparently do have a section at the beach with beds but we never went. beds by the pool is difficult to find. if you dont go whilst everyone is at breakfast, you have to wait and hope you find some during lunch time. 

hotel has potential of being better but it has alot of work to do. 
dont think we would be staying here if we come back to agadir."
"Scam of a hotel - please reconsider 

Pros: close to Mc Donald’s 

Cons: 
- very gloomy and dated 
- Very poor food quality 
- mis information regarding rooms - ROOMS DO NOT LOOK LIKE THE PHOTOS - they look like rooms in a 2 star hotel 
- 5 hours of no electricity on 28/11
- Loud noise till 4/5 am. 
- Very poor WiFi connection- ONLY AVAILABLE IN SOME AREAS OF THE HOTEL; not guaranteed to get it in your rooms 
- Have to pay for the safety deposit box to be used 
- Smelly rooms 
- Checkout is at 11 (not as advertised on booking.com) 

On arrival there was a very long queue to check in with two receptionists at the desk. 

The hotel itself is very dated and gloomy at night. The whole check in process took 45 minutes or so that by the time we went for dinner it was 9:45pm. We were told that dinner would be available till 10pm however at 9:45pm there was barely any food and the food that was there was unappetising and cold. The staff in the restaurant we’re pushy and rushing us. 

The rooms were dated and dirty especially the bathroom which was dirty and parts of the paint was peeling off. 

We got no sleep on the first night. The club was downstairs and the bass was so very loud that we could not sleep. 

We then asked for a change in room and they gave us ones that were of the same poor quality but the noise was mildly better as these rooms were closer to the pool- music till late night but no bass- mild improvement right? 

I stayed with my family and they then mixed up my rooms with the rooms for my family and had given these rooms away during our excursion to Marrakech resulting lost property. Manager  Bengouram adil  was very unhelpful and ignored customers when requested to talk to him. 

Please RECONSIDER staying at this property if you value a good, peaceful holiday as this holiday was any but that due to this disgraceful “hotel”"
"I booked this for are 25th wedding anniversary it stated that it was a quiet location but not far from beach, ok yes it wasn't too far from beach about 20mins walk with my dodgy knee, but No were was quiet.  first i had sent 2 emails explaining that it was our silver wedding anniversary  and it would be nice to have some fruit or flowers on our arrive. but when we arrive we were met with the most grumpiest receptionist i ever seen. I explained that i had emailed them twice with no reply she ignored me, she said we had to wait until 3pm to get into the room as it was been cleaned. ha what a joke. I had ordered a double room with a balcony we go a room with 3 single beds no balcony and smelly air con so we had to open the only window to the sound of constant traffic and a night club, we wanted to have a shower so my husband when in first (only 1 towel) also the cold bath tap crumble in his hand and after 3 days of reporting it, the finally repaired it but the maintenance guy didn't know any think about it the whole place was very  dirty and extremely dated please don't go by there Boucher its a lie (see my pics) don't get me wrong Morocco is a great place to visit just don't book the Argana Hotel some of the staff were nice and we tipped accordingly"
"Like all other reviews which seemed to be mixed. It's what you pay for us what you get. I always do my research but this time as it was my bday surprise holiday I couldn't. I won't recommend this hotel"
"Very stressful stay. We arrived to casually be told that we'd be spending our first night at a replacement hotel. We were sent to a smelly hotel which lacked a sea view (as per my original booking ) and had a dirty and unusable pool, and also gave us double bed despite my specific request for a twin. As a bonus the tv was useless as no English channels (something I specifically requested also prior to booking ) Another frustrating aspect was the expectation that I'd have to go back and forth between this replacement hotel and Argana for dinner.

So the next day at hotel argana I receive a slight 'upgrade' of my room but no wifi at all in the room and no twin bed. The 'sea view' was hardly accurate too. I was told to wait for another room tomorrow (obviously by this point my holiday was ruined and limited to mostly stress and anxiety).

Even in communal areas of the hotel the wifi is absolutely pathetic.

Do not even consider staying here if you like to sleep. There is loud music on-site and at nearby hotels and clubs. I requested a quiet room and they acknowledged and insisted I'd get one. Wrong again. When I complained I was greeted with the usual 'we will change your room tomorrow'.

My final night - still no wifi in room and again no quiet room, still very close to all the blasting loud music by the pool

Generally, the hotel feels very compact for the large amount of guests it holds. The pool area feels very cramped and isn't relaxing at all. It gets very busy.
Additional issues: lamps did not work, toilet easily blocked and the room phone doesn't work.

I'm in process of trying to receive compensation. Manager sorted me a few free drinks and free airport shuttle but this is not sufficient as ruined my entire 3 days in agadir

 I was satisfied with the food at breakfast and dinner, although the drinks were very inconsistent. The juices tasted like water most of the time , the water itself tasted different at times (not in a pleasant way) and the mint tea was inconsistent 

This review may receive a generic, automated response by Argana which is no consolation and has no substance. Sort the hotel out and take time to respond properly!"
"Avoid at all costs ! We checked in yesterday and checked out once they wouldn’t move us to a clean room .On arrival to the room I was horrified by the dirt .stains on pillow. Bedding .walls .everywhere was awful .went back to reception and asked for different room as we had booked the renovated room to be told none available.maybe tomorrow or next day .I couldn’t stay one night in that room ! To be honest the whole hotel is filthy and dated .We were lucky to find another hotel nearby for the week .the difference!! No comparison.It’s just pity it’s cost us more money but you couldn’t stay if you have any standard .shame on them .Reception staff so rude and couldn’t care less .avoid avoid ! Lots lovely other places stay in"
"Where do I start…….. dirty rooms, cigarette butts and wine corks in the pool, broken lights/mirrors and almost a mile to the beach! It takes almost 20 mins to walk to the beach through building sites and dirty areas. 1.5 miles (30mins walk to marina) building site inside and out. Hammam advertised but closed, Barber shop staff rude, more interested in chatting to each other than taking care of guests. Moroccan restaurant closed, replaced with a completely rubbish Moroccan night in the buffet restaurant. 

Choose another hotel as the description of this hotel for location and facilities has clearly been stolen from another hotels site. Music blaring until early hours and building works on floor 3 from 08.20am so minimal sleep achievable. Avoid"
"hotel location is great but rooms are awful
bathroom was good size but definetly needs updating - there was mould on edges and water int he bath tub would not go down and just gathered
food at hotel is basic along with the breakfast 
resturant staff are always in your face trying to be kind but only after a TIP 
check in staff were average - we were 3 males and had booked room with 3 single beds only to be given a room with a double bed and then got a sofa bed put it - this was awful 

only good thing at hotel was the room cleaner was great she did a good job 

pool is very small and cramped 

my advise would be stay away from this hotel its not the best experience - next time i would rather pay a bit more and get a decent hotel"
"Where do I even start, went on holiday with friends and stayed in this hotel for 7 nights, not once in them 7 nights did the bed sheets get changed, they have one lady only which has to clean all the rooms on the entire floor which you could only believe how long that would take so they just come in your room and tuck your bed sheets in to make it looks neat and tidy so you think they have done your bed for you, but In actual fact they are filled with bed bugs, and this was for 7 nights so there’s a huge possibility in fact I would say for certain that they had not been changed since even before the last residents so I don’t know how many people have slept in that same bed with the same bed covers! Every morning I would wake up there would be big red lumps on different parts my body and they would just get bigger and bigger and feel itchy all day. I know for a fact these were not caused by mosquitoes bites but rather the hundreds of tiny bed bugs that have been there for god knows how long hidden under the covers which you cannot see but trust me they are there! Also not to mention the intense stench coming from the sink in the bathroom was absolutely awful, it was clogged up with all sorts of peoples impurities that had been building up for a very long time and no one had been to look at and sort out despite mentioning it to the reception numerous times it was never attended to! I would highly recommend not staying here as you will honestly regret it! If I could give zero stars I would!"
"Not sure where to start with this. We arrived on Wednesday 28th September at around 8pm. We were given a room on the ground floor. We had booked a superior sea view room and were told from reception this would not be ready till the next day. 

On arrival in the room the plug sockets, lights and shower were not working. In fact no shower facility at all. 

At 10am the next morning we waited for our room to be told it would be another hour. We then went to get something to eat and back by 11. Again it was another 20 minutes then another 15 and then we had to wait outside the room for an additional 5. 
This room was better but no where near what was expected. Again no lights working on the right side of the bed. 

We went for dinner to be greeted very well by a gentleman, we got our food and seated and ordered some drinks. As our first meal we didn’t have any spare change and we’re given a horrible dirty look and a huff from the waiter who was going round tables asking for change.

As we had not finished our drinks we took them outside to the bar area. The next day at breakfast the gentleman who served us on the previous night asked for the glasses back to which we advised we left outside, we were asked to get them from the outside bar. But no one understood what we were saying. We conveyed this to the gentleman who was not happy. 

For the rest of our trip we had poor service, no hello or kind gestures. And this really made us not want to return to eat. 

Every night it was near impossible to sleep due to the amount of noise and loud music coming from the bar/surrounding  restaurants. 

We booked a Haman massage in the hotel and were disgusted by it. Both ladies completing the massage were laughing and talking during the session. We were not massaged but more just rubbed. It was awful. 

On Tuesday we were awoken very early to the sound of banging from the roof, it was very very loud and echoed through the building. 

We also booked the Paradise valley excursion which was listed as “cliff jumping” 
When we arrived we were told it had not rained in 2 years so the water was very shallow. No fault of the hotel but this should not be promoted in the way it was as this was very disappointing. 

The hotel is listed to having free wifi - yet the Wi-Fi was unusable in the bedrooms and very unstable. 

On the last day we left our suitcases in the baggage room as we had to check out at 11 but our flight was at 7pm. 
During the day I wanted to pack a few more items, I was very capable of doing this myself but the gentleman who took me there wanted to do it for me. In doing this he snapped both zips on the case which I was distraught about. Considering it was a borrowed suitcase and quite and expensive one at that.
We then returned to collect our cases and mine had a huge dent in it. For a room that’s supposed to be locked it was awful to see. 

We also ordered some lunch on the last day, and they did not have the money in the till to give me the correct change which left me short. 

Poorly organised hotel with no manners or empathy. Completely ruined our first experience travelling to Morocco. 

However the Shisha lunge Staff and the photographer on site were absolutely fantastic. And if you do travel and want somewhere nice to eat we suggest El toro by the beach. It was incredible."
"It would not be advisable to go here if you are over 25 as there are 4 pubs and 2 nightclubs within the hotel that play ridiculously loud music pretty much 24 hours a day.It is heard in the bedrooms also.The room is very poor but I expected this as it was cheap.What I didn’t expect was virtually no air conditioning and the patio door wouldn’t lock.It is in  a dodgy area,every time I went out of the hotel people were offering me hash/cocaine and kept following me to get me to buy.The guy that hangs around reception(looks like a manager type)is very disinterested in dealing with anything.Agadir generally feels very unsafe,there are police and army everywhere and I can see why.The airport experience is very unsettling with the amount of times they check your passport and asking what is job,etc.I went to Agadir for the first time in June for 2 weeks but stayed in Iberostar.I was a bit blinkered because the hotel was good and didn’t leave it much.I will be staying with Spain/Portugal in future."
"The noise level in the bedroom from the entertainment was too loud to sleep. The music and tannoy from the Argana entertainment by the pool does go quiet at midnight, but the disco from the adjacent Hotel Mabrouk continues until 5am! 

The reception manager moved us to another bedroom, but this only made the situation worse! Four nights at the Argana and no more than a total of eleven hours sleep!

For this reason we had no choice but to book into another hotel for 6 of the 10 nights. Argana Hotel Management did NOT offer any sort of refund for the 6 days we didn't eat (full board) or sleep at their hotel! It cost me an additional £318  to stay at another hotel so we can get some sleep and relaxation during our holiday in Agadir.

Argana management, please DO NOT reply with ""the loud music until late is what other customers want""!  If you're so happy with your decision to play loud music that adversely affects some customers, why do you not advertise this on your website or other booking sites? Answer: Because you know you would lose some customers and money. It's simple, you're greedy and deceitful!

Hotel management does nothing about  anti social at 1am 2am 3am... Ever! Example, a group of guests cheering in reception at 2am in front of security and reception staff and no action taken.

For our terrible experience at the Argana the management offered us a late checkout, thanks!

The hotel is run down and in need of refurbishment, the rooms were dirty, half the lights didn't work, only cold water on for showers for the last 18 hours. The hotel safe can NOT free like other hotels. The curtains were 2ft shy of being able to cover the patio doors, so room in daylight by 7am.

The Argana offers a poor selection of poorly matched low quality food. 

In summary, if you want to party all night, have very low expectations and you're a heavy sleeper, then this is the perfect hotel for you. Otherwise, AVOID THIS HOTEL and AVOID AGADIR."
"On the first night of the stay we realised the AC wasn’t working, we tried to call the desk and the phone was not working, as we were tired we left it till morning. In the morning we were told the ac isn’t working on the whole floor and they will give us a new room, the room we were offered was half the size and didn’t have proper beds which we paid for. So due to no other choice we had to stay in a room with no ac for our entire stay. The toilet was broken and would move if you made a slight movement, the hair dryer was not working. On the plus side, the staff were nice and were not rude, so the mishap with the rooms may be due to the hotel itself and not the fault of the staff."
"This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. 
Music blasts at the poolside all day and then the volume is raised to an insane level from about 7pm till midnight and a DJ speaks / yells into the microphone throughout. It is impossible to sleep - especially if you are on the side of the hotel by the pool. I asked four times one night to the reception staff when the music would stop and each time I got the same answer: “maximum 10 minutes” 
I am incredulous as to how a hotel thinks blasting music into the night is a good way to run a hotel. It’s almost laughable. 
In the day time I asked for a pina colada at the pool bar and I got a pineapple juice. My partner asked for a margarita and it was undrinkable - it was just bitter lemon cordial it seemed. 
The gym is not free - you have to pay for it. 
The activities at the poolside seem forced on you - why on earth can staff not just leave people to enjoy the pool instead of putting on lots of activities that take up the whole pool which only a fraction of the clientele seem to enjoy.  
Breakfast is okay but so chaotic ! We had to get down early to miss all the queues for food etc.
I really hate leaving bad reviews - I don’t think I’ve ever left a bad review for a hotel but this was honestly a nightmare. The biggest thing was the music being blasted from the speakers into the night with this intolerable DJ yelling into his microphone. I stayed here for two nights but by night one I wanted to leave, it was only because the hotel staff said the noise wouldn’t be bad on the second night that I decided to stay (spoiler: it was the same) 
It goes without saying that I would never ever stay here again……"
"Avoid at all costs. Noise level at all times of the day are unbearable.  Allocated a room over the nightclub on 1st night, 5.30am before music stopped but followed at 7am by construction noise. Moved to only other available room over pool, noise level until 1am also unbearable followed by booming dance music from adjoining nightclub until 5am at which time taxis congregated and blared their horns for 30mins. At best a poor 3star, breakfast was dismal but staff were pleasant and helpful. Was sold to me as being in a fantastic location which was a blatant lie, run down derelict area with no pathways as they were all dug up. Lane way to beach was filthy and strewn with bodies of homeless including small children.  First and last visit to Agadir which is hugely disappointing as we had waited 3 years for this much needed holiday."
"We have just returned yesterday from Hotel Argana - this is the noisiest hotel we have ever stayed at with music until way past midnight - thumping - with no getting away from it. Music during the day was also unbelievably loud with no quiet areas to sit in.
On arrival the Hotel receptionist staff are unfriendly and rude and continued this whenever we needed help. The rooms are very tatty - stained bath , cracked toilet flush , leaky taps , broken dressing table , dangerous lighting, damaged door look and smell everywhere of sewage.
The really dont seem to like the English in this Hotel at all. The food was geared to Morcoccons - no English or plain food at all inc bread, the same dishes every night and very little choice. Watch the young waiters trying to not bring any change back for your drinks. They have constant "" wailing"" music on which really drives you up the wall.
The room we had was very tatty with broken door lock - looked like it had been broken into - toilet flush was cracked - bathroom sink leaked, bath was stained, shower curtain mouldy, dressing table veneer all damaged, dangerous lighting on bedside lamps - bedding not changes at all - towels were grey and dirty."
"From the arrival it was not pleasant.......if you have booked this hotel cancel now!...It is a family hotel so expect 100's of children badly behaved ..the breakfast is FREE...but it should called  FREEFOR ALL!!.......staff rushing to get plates and cups replenished a nd people not using the tongs...people even sleeping in the hotel lobby with feet on the lounges!...room was so bad...had to change it the next day...and that new room had NO AIR CONDITIONING!!...Front office staff were not pleasant ....I had reserved a JUNIOR SUITE....it was just a large room and balcony!......ordered a fruit plate and it took 3 days and 4 visits to the front desk to ensure it arrived....booking.com says 'private pool'....ahhh NO!!!...its just a normal hotel pool FULL of children!"
"We went with a large group for a holiday this month. I personally had a very mixed experience with this hotel and have to admit it was mostly a negative experience. However, i will first talk about some of the positives.

1. The security guard at the front who does day time is very very good. He always used to make sure we were happy and always smiling. It really helped make the holiday nicer.
2. If you like shisha there is a lounge right next to the pool. We found this very convenient and used it often
3. Near to beach, about 10-15mins walk.Beach promenade is very big with lots of places to eat and things to do.

OK now onto the negative side, now I am going speaking from the view point of someone who regularly goes on family vacations to many countries and I am very much used to staying at five star and four star resorts all over the world.

This is hands down the worst 4 star hotel I have ever stayed at and I would really really want to know how they have come to the conclusion this is four star?

Let's talk about the negatives:

1. Hotel looks very old and dated and dusty. It really needs a deep clean and new furniture...New everything.
2. The rooms we were initially given are not what you see in the pictures. The rooms were absolutely filthy, bathroom was dirty towels were wet, shower broken, toilet broken.....seriously I felt like I was in a hostel in a backpacking holiday in a remote part of the world.
They gave us new rooms after we made a complaint which was much more to our standard.
3. Breakfast. Very little selection and it was very very busy. Difficult to get a seat and the staff clearly struggle when then hotel is busy as it is very hard to get their attention during these times.
4. Beach towels not properly cleaned. I dont understand how basic things like this are not done?
5. Swimming pool was enjoyable but very dirty. First time I have been to a swimming pool and I cudnt see anything under the water?!!!! How often is it cleaned? 
6. WIFi in hotel is non existent. Very bad signal you will need to buy a sim or use your existing data if you want Internet without any issues.

I will be returning to Morroco at some point but will be avoiding this place like the plague nd would not recommend it to any family or freinds."
"I am unsure where I should begin. I had to reactive my trip advisor log in, just to make people aware how this hotel scams you into booking their rooms. Several points to mention please read through if you plan to travel from the UK. We travelled to this hotel 7th-14 August with a large group 18, as a family holiday. 
1) We booked a triple room which showed decent pictures of the room. When we went to the hotel, they gave us rooms which looked nothing like the pictures. This was borderline prison looking rooms and should be renamed Hostel. Honestly it was beyond unsatisfactory. With the curtains all coming down, really bad urine smell in the room, dirty floors and incredibly dirty bath tub. The towels weren’t clean, I almost wiped my face on a wet towel, when I asked the staff to check if it’s fresh he said no. They were folded and placed there for us to use (filthy). The walk to these rooms is incredibly long and very very dark. I was afraid of inviting creepy crawlers into my luggage, so didn’t open it at all. I wanted to call the reception from my room, as I have 2 young children under 3, and noticed the cable was physically cut off (hilarious now to think back). When I went down to complain, it’s almost like they expected it, tried to calm us down and instantly said we will upgrade your rooms to a ‘new part of the hotel’- tomorrow! This was NOT an upgrade as we paid for triple rooms. It was a downgrade to a double room with a sofa. But they made us sleep the first night of our holiday in the hostel rooms, rest assured none of us slept as it was beyond filthy. As the next day approached, they promised for new rooms at 9am. We all raced to the reception to be told ‘you have to check out of your room and we can check you back in at 3pm’! Absolutely ridiculous. 17 of us without a room for several hours, while they try fix the issue they started. The new rooms they gave us was the pictures I booked the triple room online with! Appalling to say the least-the hotel manager admitted that they move customers from UK to the new rooms if they complain ONLY. So unless you all complain after day 1, you won’t get what you paid for. 
2) What brings me to my second point. The staff are extremely rude. They lie as a living and completely immune to complaints. They are so used to people complaining they actually stopped caring. Staff speak English and forget they speak English the next day just to avoid you. I had a lady in the front, shout at me as one of my family members complained about the smaller ‘upgraded rooms’. We had a right to complain they almost ruined our holiday, putting us into prison looking rooms. As the reception transferred our rooms she forgot to transfer my half board over- this is where poop hits the fan. I went to eat with my 2 little children, the staff in the canteen came and said that I’m not half board. I explained there must be a mistake as we changed rooms and that they should ask reception. They asked reception, came to me and told me to LEAVE MY FOOD. The guy literally said put the plate down. I was fuming, for a service I paid for, who would lie about something like this over a few pounds? Secondly he should’ve let me finish my food and then address the issue. No common sense or respect whatsoever. So at this point, in front of all other customers I felt extremely embarrassed, I took the staff to the reception and the lady ‘apologised for the misunderstanding’ as one of the ladies made a mistake. Misunderstanding? The most untrained staff, rude and inconsiderate. My stomach was full from their lies at this point.
3) the services in the hotel- shisha was great if they ever changed the water in the pipe. Pool was very very dirty, small pool was practically empty for 2 days with having to chase staff to re fill. Area around the pool is incredibly dirty too all they need is to power jet spray. The hotel is generally very run down and needs TLC. It’s very very dark inside and could do with brightening up, they probably afraid to make it too bright that people will spot the dirt. You need to pay to use their safe in the room, the pool towels are always unavailable and they smell. Take your own shower products as that is also an issue to track down. 
In conclusion. This was the fairest review I could provide as I was extremely disappointed, this hotel should be for their locals and not for UK customers. Most people travel to hotel to get a better living experience than the UK, it was definitely the polar opposite. Avoid at all costs and please we urge you to look elsewhere!"
"It's not the first trip to that area, but seemingly the worst. The hotel looks good only on pictures. The service was poor and the employees in the place are not eager to help. Definitely not service-orientated place.
The hotel deserves a massive renovation. Our room standard would be ok back in 70's but only as a 2 star accomodation.
Avoid if you can.  The tap water smelled like sewage."
"Avoid apart from the entertainment and cleaning staff  who were lovely and made you welcome apart from that avoid .My balcony lock was broken .so I reported to the hotel manager and I was told it can t be fixed due to a new lock being replaced by a company outside the hotel and I would be moved to another room in which they did not and left me feeling insecure also the food awful barely warm and flies all over dessert cakes and bread rolls (yes I know there is a lot more flies in hot countries and we're there is food around ) but they could be covered in this I got an upset stomach and on Monday night the was a rave outside the hotel near the barber shop went on til after 12 at night got told it would stop soon the guy at the reception was not interested in mine or anyone else's complai ts of the music and on Tuesday I returned to my room and notice the glass was coming out of the patio door .I went to reception and called a guy to come and see he went away and 2 guy s were fixing the door and I video recorded them doing the work .They stopped working went out of the room and after a few minutes later my door knocked and there were 4 men one I know as the manager who I spoke to when I arrived about the broken lock and the other man who was fixing the door I was told or rather threatened to delete the video I recorded of them fixing my patio door and on wedsday I had to order a taxi because my  transfer let me down .As you see the before and after pictures of the door"
"Booked 10 days, superior room with seaview. On arrival we were allocated a room on the ground floor, the view was a bush. We complained and were given a room higher up with a view but it was the grubbiest room we have ever seen! There was a dirty bathtub with over shower and it certainly wasnt superior in any sense of the word! We complained again and finally got a superior room with a seaview but this was on the 4th day of our holiday. The food was edible if you could find something you liked, put it this way, we didnt starve. At breakfast you could have as much tea, coffee, juice as you wanted but with dinner if you wanted a drink you had to buy it. Most of the female waiting staff dont speak a single word of English so when you order your drinks its hit and miss what you actually get. One of the waitresses in particular was quite rude (Nassima). The entertainment is rubbish, you cant understand a word they say as they seem to speak every language apart from English! The music from a neighbouring hotel is extremely loud and we found it goes on into the very small hours, even until 6am on some days. We found one member of the entertainment staff brilliant, (Taoufik) spoke very good English and went out of his way to make us feel welcome. Overall the hotel is old, in desperate need of revamping but the pool was kept immaculately clean and was very impressive. We wouldnt go back to this hotel. The seagulls are funny,, much better than the entertainment!"
"Where do I start with this hotel. We’ve just come back from a 5 night stay at this hotel. On the first day we arrived we were told our room would be ready at 3/4pm although our booking said  2pm check in.  We asked if we could have a room ASAP as we had our baby with us, we were told a room was getting ready and when we arrived to the room the cleaner was still in. Once we entered the room it was very dated, had what looked like a poop stain in the bath tub and no hand soap or toilet roll provided in the bathroom. We complained at the front desk and we’re given one of the refurbished rooms. The room was Ok for the price you pay but for me the room was not very clean. Hotel towels are very old and look dirty. The whole place felt grubby and obviously hadn’t had a deep clean in sometime. The hotel itself is very dated, quite dark and dingy. Don’t believe the pictures you see online. We did not enjoy our stay here, the dining room for breakfast and dinner was very old and dated, the baby high chairs were literally dirty and sticky, cups were not clean at breakfast time. Hygiene in this place was lacking a great deal. Also if you come here be aware no irons are provided, you must use the expensive in-house laundry service. We also had issues with the tiny lifts. Only two lifts in the entire hotel which fit a maximum of 3 people and most of the time only one lift was working. 

Also don’t bother with the Wi-Fi. It does not work. Even if you sit in the hotel lobby. We gave up and bought a sim to use internet whilst we were out there. 

Based on our stay here we would not recommend this hotel. It’s very noisy, dated and grubby (our room was not being cleaned on a daily basis either). Yes it’s cheap but you won’t enjoy it very much. We definitely will not be coming back to Hotel Argana."
"They don’t clean your rooms unless you ask repeatedly. Dirty towels which they try to charge you for. House keeping just walking into your rooms. Lastly we were followed by two men and were trying to get back to the hotel with our pizza which we got from outside the hotel. Despite telling the security we were being followed and he could see the men, he refused! The worst. I guess it’s cheap and cheerful but wouldn’t chose this as a hotel to spend all your time in"
"On arriving at this hotel, we were taken to 2 rooms which were very dated..not like what we'd seen in the pictures. The bathrooms were dirty in both rooms and there was no balcony just a small window. I emediately felt clostephobic. The AC wasn't working either. After refusing to have these rooms we were upgraded however the toilet was blocked and would take 4 flushes at a time which was annoying. The towels looked like they'd seen better days almost rags and the same goes for the bedding. The WIFI was terrible! 
On the plus side the breakfast was nice and there were plenty of chill out spaces around the hotel. I wouldn't stay here again to be honest I'd rather pay the extra and get 5* facilities."
"Our holiday couldn’t start in a worse way. After our first night 2 in our group were robbed of 220 pounds after we told the cleaners not to clean our rooms as we only arrived the day before.
We were told they will investigate the matter but the suspected cleaners were still on shift… appalling!!!!!
Managers said they couldn’t compensate us and that it wasn’t the first time happening. How can you stay in a place where the staff is not trustworthy?!?!?
Stay away from this place, shame cos Agadir is a nice holiday location."
"We have travelled a lot as a family and visited Morocco many times before. This is hands down THE WORST place we've ever stayed at in Morocco. We arrived to find that they had no room for us, despite having booked, paid in full, and had a confirmation email. They led us to a weird and abandoned side of the hotel that our boys found super creepy, and said we could stay there for the night and get a family room in the morning. It was 8pm and we didn't have any choice. At 9pm our family room was miraculously available! This happened the same night go another family; they were still trying to get their room the following lunchtime. 

The pool is super crowded with chain smokers and people leaving used glasses everywhere that isn't cleaned up for hours. 

There were rarely plates or cutlery at breakfast, let alone tea bags. Many food items would be gone in an instant. 

But on a positive note, our room was actually lovely. Once we were able to actually go in. 

Agadir was the start of three months travelling Morocco for us. Our boys appreciated the pool and beach time. But thankfully the rest of our travels through Morocco have been incredible. Such a shame we chose this hotel to start with. 

Oh and I forget to mention the service - let's just say, I don't think the staff enjoy their jobs."
"I lost my fly and I informed about my change but they don’t care  the personal of this hotel was very impolite and very rude , they send me on the street, I don’t want to someone have the same experience ,was the bad day in my life when I meet this people. I don't recommend it.👎"
"Was booked to stay here for the next few days, but at check in (with borderline rude staff), we could hear very loud building works going on at 4pm in the afternoon.   Check in staff tried to shine on it was only for an hour a day - as if.

Made it as far as the room, which is clearly photographed with a fish eye lens before the angle grinding kicked in again.  Afraid I threw a fit and went straight back downstairs and asked for a refund.

The third floor is draped with plastic and barriers, and four rooms are actively being renovated.

So if you're happy with staying in a building site, check in and enjoy yourself.  Oh, it's also next to a nightclub, and on a main road, so if you're looking for quiet, this is NOT the place.

I'd give it zero stars if possible.   What a dump."
"The worst hotel ever. My husbad saw 4 stars and some unreal pictures on bking so he booked. Hotel looks very old and rusty. Bathroom-… it was hard to take shower there. Towels are gray if you decide to go there take yours. Wifi connection very poor i had to buy sim card. And finaly i was after unpleastnt shower waiting naked to get dry(i hadn’t my own towel) and service come into my room without even knocking(there was no do not disturb sign to put on the door). THE WORST HOTEL I’VE EVER BEEN."
"Poor experience in a definitely not 4 star hotel. 
Room is dirty with over flowing shower and a disgusting fridge. On the second day we spoke to the customer relations lady who said she would sort out issues with shower and fridge but did nothing. We ended up buying cleaning products and cleaning fridge ourselves.
Pool area is nice and the entertainment staff were really attentive.
Breakfast was typical European but it was obvious the food was left overs from night before and really unhygienic. Dinner was awful, same stuff every day and most of the salad bar was hangovers from breakfast or worse the day before. By Sunday night there was no effort to even hide that and the just put the mornings  cold boiled eggs, pancakes and pastries on a separate table. 
So many staff around it was unacceptable to poor standard of service. 
Definitely could not recommend this to any other visitors"
"After 5 hours on the road coming up from the south of Morocco , arrived just for one night , flight very early the next morning . Room not ready , come back in 30 minutes ....room not ready ....come back in 30 minutes....room not ready......2 hours later arrive in the room , floor is completely wet and not clean at all  , asked for a double bed but two single....ok we can live with that . Tried calling reception but the room phone is broken 
Into the shower , bathroom lightbulb hanging on a wire, no glass , bath completely blocked after a short shower .
The other problem is that the hotel next door has  music blasting out all afternoon and it's a night/rave club at night , so ....no sleep until 3 or 4 in the morning and you have a taxi at 6 for the airport...
The personnel are half asleep , not particularly interested really ....sad , lazy , taking the mickey in my mind .
Avoid this hotel....."
"I stayed here with three other friends.. when booking the hotel we paid extra for 2 sea view rooms. When we arrived at the hotel the reception staff were not welcoming at all.. they then proceeded to tell us they had over booked and we’re not able to provide the room we paid for and we would have to stay in a basic room for a night, we had not other option but to accept the room
and over heard the reception telling other visitors the same. The room we were given was disgusting! It smelled like something died in there and there was dust and dirt everywhere. The beds stank of damp and could see the covers had not been washed in a while. 
The next day after chasing up loads we finally got a
Different room however that did not have the sea view I paid for and was on the first floor so just a load of bushes to look out. The reception staff were not helpful at all and we were passed from pillar to post until the reception manager offered us
Another room higher up, this had a decent view however no wifi. 
 The cleaner however WAFA was the sweetest lady and did an amazing job at the second room. She is the only good thing in that hotel. 
The breakfast was decent but was the same all week and no fruit. 
The rooms advertised on love holidays is a total lie and the rooms don’t include most of the things in the list.  I don’t usually write reviews or feedback but this was needed as it really ruined my honeymoon."
"It's so filthy ! It's a shame their doors are still open for clients.
We arrive at 5pm and we've been given  an undone room ( untidy bed and dirty towels used by previous clients).
Once I talked to the man at the front desk who did our check in, he didn't even apologise for such a huge mistake and gave us other keys for a room different than what we asked for . 
We've been given other rooms the following day after talking to a very kind lady called meryem . She's the only professional and polite person In the whole facility.
The room we got this time had a nicer view but again it had the same issue ! IT WAS FILTHY AND DISGUSTING
Spiders everywhere, snot on the door handles, dirty socks in the closet , hair on the pillows , oily stains on the sheets 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
I spent the most uncomfortable week of my life 
I can't believe it's a 4 stars hotel they're awful"
"The best thing about this hotel is its free breakfast.  It is completely amazing.  It is buffet style and has everything you could want from a typical Moroccan breakfast of condiments and bread to a Western style one of eggs and meat.  It was one of the best breakfasts I've had while traveling, especially as I am a budget traveler. The other positive thing was that the rooms all seem to have an outside area that overlooks the pool.

Unfortunately I cannot rate the rest of my stay as positively.  The pool area is lovely, however, the pool is not heated so, unless you're traveling in the summer, it's not really conducive for a swim or lounging in.  I was frustratingly never able to get consistent Wifi in my room.  I called the front desk numerous times to no effect.  Staff would say 'we'll send someone' but no one ever showed up.  I finally gave up.

In the day there is piped in music throughout the building and no way to turn it off if you want to take an afternoon nap.  There is also no overhead light in the room so if you want to read at night, it is not possible because there's only a very low light by the bed.  There was one electrical outlet in the room and it was not by the bed but by the dresser and there was no chair.  This made it impossible to use the computer with ease but since Wifi was barely existent, it became a moot point.  You can walk to the beach from the hotel but you have to find your own way.  It is about a 20 minute walk.

Staff was pleasant but ineffectual."
"Where is my review somehow my last one was deleted? Is it because I fell down wet steps that your cleaner left wet in the middle of the breakfast service? No accident book to report it in ? No concern from reception?The hotel desperately needs work doing to it unfortunately we had a really bad experience here. Some staff were lovely . The rooms were grotty and tired. Definitely need a makeover. Swimming pool area was ok but the loungers are on their last legs."
"The reception staff are rude and not welcoming at all, the doormen they are lovely and very friendly. You pay for dinner and breakfast included in the price of the room but they do not offer any water which was shocking as most hotels we have stayed in give you one large bottle of water daily, so this did shock me. The hotel itself is not bad but it needs alot of work on, I would rate it 2 star as its very dusty and needs fixing. The corridors are horrendous reminded me of a horror movie. The cafe attached to the hotel by the pool always tried to scam us and sneakily charge us more. But I think alot of people in Morroco do this. I wouldn't recommend anyone staying here unless they are desperate as there are plenty of nicer hotels in the area. We travelled through morocco and stayed at alot of hotels and I must say this is one of the worst. We ended up moving to hotel atlas amadil beach hotel which was only 5 minutes away and it was cheaper and 10x better right on the beach too! glad to have spent out last 2 nights there. This hotel was a let down"
"The room was very basic but the bed was clean and fresh bedding. Bathroom could do with a update, mouldy tiles and smelled a bit fusty.
 
Pool area is nice and clean and plenty of beds and umbrellas.

Entertainment staff were lovely and my son enjoyed the pool games.

Food was okay, nothing special but could put a decent meal together and didn't go hungry. £2 for a bottle of flag beer at the hotel bar which isn't bad.

Biggest issue is the hotel/club next door, loud music all day and night and you can hear this even with the doors shut. For this reason I wouldn't stay here again. I'm not a party pooper but difficult to sleep with the constant thumping."
"On first arrival impressions are good, although reception were very slow.
After a 45 minute wait because of a problem with my booking on thier system we're checked in an promised a nice room.
The room was poor, two single beds for my partner and I,
Fag burns in the curtains, long black hairs on the bathroom tiles, very poor standard of finish on the decoration and maintenance.
The breakfast buffet was consistently awful with a horrible egg slop as part of a hot food buffet (picture attached). 
No social distancing and very under staffed, if you don't get up early you won't get a chance to eat as total chaos.

Shouldn't be advertised as 4* 
Definitely worth spending a bit more and getting a nice hotel. As this has been very disappointing"
"This hotel is advertised as 4 star, it most definitely is not, it is dire need of a make over, very tired looking, we had to hold the shower head to shower as there was no fitting on the wall!! The towels had definitely seen better days, the pool was nice, but the sun beds had really dirty pads on them, so most days we went to the beach,oh and by the way the advertised private hotel beach is non existent!! They played music round the pool far to loudly, you couldn’t hear yourself think!!! The so called entertainment was awful!! The food was ok could have been warmer but it was tasty, however the plates you put your food on were nearly all chipped!! Not good!
The weather was fabulous as was the beach I would visit Agadir again but I wouldn’t stay in this hotel"
"I decided to give this hotel a second chance as per my review below and as management suggested, this time with family and booked 2 rooms. - what a bad idea it was !!!

First of all we booked 8 days , with breakfast. We kindly requested 2 rooms next to us which was given. The rooms were noisy and my mother's Air conditioning was not working for 2 days after multiple complaining to reception and no outcome she took it to management and they changed her room, I repeat,  2 Days!! No AC or TV working in her room. Terrible.

Second was the breakfasts. NO COVID protocols were in place, no masks being worn, no hand gel provided in the dining area and everyone was just constantly waiting for plates and cups.

THIRDLY was the cleaning, bed sheets were not getting cleaned, I asked 6 times for a cot to be provided for my 2 year old child, no quilt was provided just a white thin sheet.

As management suggested on my previous review to give it a second chance, I did and it seems alot more issues have arisen in this hotel. I won't be back."
"Hotel is absolutely disgusting 🤮 smells horrible the sheets don’t even seem clean the room has a stench and the lighting is poor!! Absolutely not baby friendly!! The rooms are in a horrible condition I wouldn’t even pay a £10 for the  of room"
"Where do i start ? What a terrible hotel and service at reception upon checkin. My wife is 7 months  pregnant and we arrived at the hotel at 1.30pm. We were kept being told to wait 30 mins, then again 30 mins and again 30 mins by the receptionist. After arguing and refusing to move at reception we were given a room at 6.30pm!!! 5 hours waiting in reception , what a shambles and disgrace!!!! After we were given our junior suite. The patio door would not lock and the telephone did not work, i complained again and they came and fixed patio door however the telephone remained unfixed until checkout. 

Worst part of the stay was my car being crashed into in the hotel car parking. (Which had cameras) i kept insisting with the security people on the door to view the cameras however they kept telling me nothing is there or they found nothing which clearly they didnt even bother to look or search.

I am appealing to all people to avoid this hotel at all costs. The rooms are dirty and hugely different from the photos provided. The pool area is dirty, everything about this hotel is wrong and it seems they just want to fill rooms and not care about guests or quality control or anything. Oh and the seagulls , dont get me started on the seagulls at breakfast time if you eat outside. "
"I have been to some awful places around the world including some fairly basic hostels which have been more inviting please do NOT stay anywhere near this place.

I am not a fussy eater or that bothered about things being a bit poorly arranged. Even throw in the odd rude member of staff but this place is vile.

Only nice man was the security guy.

Reception - Rude and care only about money we’re laughing at us for making a reasonable request.

Bed - covered in bites and can guarantee they are not mosquitos. Dirty marks in many places.

Food - breakfast included really stale bread and slop

Food - Dinner was absolutely vile and led to sickness 
Chicken in a white sauce which I can only describe as prison food.

Was told breakfast and dinner included drinks but not sign of drinks and the 2 cokes we had we were hounded for £5 / 50dh

We decided to end a 4 day visit to 2 days and on explaining all of the above the reception man was laughing at us and not willing to refund nor pay back the tax for the 2 additional nights. 

However, they were adamant we pay the £5 for coke.

I’ve stayed in many hotels in Agadir and this despite the photos looking ok was truly the most disgusting place I have ever been in."
"We as promised family room and paid for the top price. However. When we arrived we was given small room with  one double bed. We had 2 babies. We made complaints to reception. Than we had hotel managers given us another room above night club again with one double bed and single bed. Everything  we had music until 6am. Thorougout night we had our kids crying couldnt sleep due to lound  music.

We had Bad bags and cockroach in our bedroom. Disgusting bathroom. We had block sink for 4 days we reported at reception but nobody came to fix it.

Breakfast was the worst-ever very small section and cold food.

I wouldnt suggest avoid this hotel. Save your money and time."
"Rooms need updating 
Has tons of potential, we were in old section that needs better cleaning in hallways and updating. Our hairdryer blew up the first night and never got replaced the whole time we were there. Buffet breakfast was average. Eggs need to be cooked more. A variety of fruits could have been served. Like bananas melons pomegranate pineapple. “Ackmed” was the best server waiter we’ve ever experienced. He was the most attentive server we have experienced in all our travels. A pleasure to see every morning! So appreciated.  Staff at front door very helpful and friendly.
If I stayed again I’d ask for a room overlooking the pool.  Better view than side street and not as noisy. 

"
"I would not recommend staying at this hotel and it is certainly not 4 stars as advertised.  It is a shame as the staff in the restaurant and around the pool are very friendly and helpful but that's where is ends.   The pool facilities are also good.   We booked the hotel as the advertised rooms looked lovely, this was far from the reality.  We checked into the hotel late in the evening and it was honesty like ""Faulty Towers"" and certainly not friendly.  From there it went from bad to worse.  We eventually found our rooms and they were really bad.   We were kept awake most of the night due to the noise from the road and nightclubs.   The following day we asked to move rooms.   We were asked to bring our bags to reception and we would be given alternative rooms in a couple of hours.    We went back to reception after this time but were told it would be another half an hour, then another half an hour.   Eventually 7 hours later we were given our new rooms.  The new rooms were not much better - there was no hairdryer, the phone and air conditioning did not work and you could not close the balcony door properly so you could open from the outside.   The shower was not fixed to the wall so had to be hand held and was very awkward and there was really bad mould in the bathroom generally.   The room was just shabby and light fittings were loose and fixed with tape which was dangerous.   I reported the shortcomings to reception staff on several occasions and they were just not interested, rude and did nothing.  We did initially have armchairs in the room but these were subsequently removed.  It was just unbelievable.  The final straw came when a plastic bag was removed from our room.  I don't know if it was mistaken for rubbish but there was food in the bag and also my daughter's medication.   I reported this to reception and they were so rude and just looked at me.   I was eventually asked to take a seat and basically ignored. I even went to find the cleaners myself but this was fruitless.    I gave up in the end and spent ages looking for a chemist to find alternative medication.   After this I gave up, and stopped asking.   I have stayed in loads of hotel worldwide and have never experienced such appalling and disinterested customer service from reception staff.   This experience has really spoilt our holiday."
"Do not believe the good reviews on here as the staff write them themselves! Bit of a coincedence to keep mentioning Said and Maryam and Hamza dont you think!  It was the same 3people who kept hassling us to write them a good review - So, we arrived at reception which took an age to book in and they were quite abrupt but we thought ok give them benefit of the doubt, next day we requested a blanket 4 times throughout the day only to be told that night housekeeping closed you’ll get one tomorrow- tomorrow never came. All in all this hotel is beautiful outside of the rooms but definitley NOT A 4 STAR! Lights,toilet seat,fittings either broken or held together by cardboard, beds rock hard! Having saids that facilities are clean such as pool area and resteraunt. Breakfast - dont bother. Spagos food is nice though. Shisha bar is very nice and staff in there nice too they could do with training the reception staff on good customer service. Throughout our stay we heard nothing but complaints from other guests and staff didnt seem to take any responsibility and as for so called manager -nowhere to be seen! Avoid if you dont want to spoil your stay as due to this hotel we wont be visiting Morroco again!!!!!!! "
"The hotel is not good dont reccomend people coming in to your room when you are not in the hotel money going missing food is disgusting breakfast is rotten cracks all over floor music playing till 5am so no sleep speak to staff and they say its not there problem lift is unsafe to get in breakfast in the morning is 3 days old air conditioning dont work hot water is not hot and is cold all during the day would definatley not reccomend dont even deserve a star it deserves a -5 star"
"Worst hotel experience ever! We arrived to be  told that our room had been given away, and there was no room left. 
We have been treated so horribly, they firstly refused to speak to us, they wanted to speak our partners instead. We were a group of 3 women.
We have been shouted at in the reception and in the hotel manager's office because we didn’t want to go to the other hotel.
We reluctantly moved to a horrible hotel which had 2 stars and was under construction. We had to move room twice due to lack or functioning door, the awful smell of smoke. Such awful upheaval on the first night of my sisters birthday trip that we have been saving for ages.
We then returned to the hotel the next day at 12pm ,the time we were told to,  and unsurprisingly the room was not ready. They were beyond unprofessional, screaming over our heads at  other customers in Arabic / Berber who were standing behind us slamming their hand off the desk, security even had to intervene all while we were trying to find out if we even had a room for the night ahead as the previous evening they refused to give us confirmation of our booking. I was physically shaking and worried for our safety due to the aggression of the reception staff. 
We were then 'ungraded' to a junior suite that had only one bed for 3 people and when I complained was asked if I knew what a couch was. I cannot express how horrible we were treated by reception staff and management. They later tried to cheat us into paying for the massage that had been reluctantly given due to our horrible treatment. When I went to check out I discovered that they had already taken the payment, and had overcharged us. We have complained to booking.com but the hotel have as of yet not responded to them. Other customers reviews who mention poor cleanliness and uncomfortable beds are all also accurate."
"Just returned home from what was supposed to be a relaxing weeks holiday at this hotel. Came home more tired than when we went. Nightclub attached to the hotel opened every night til 4 am had read the reviews and thought we would be ok how wrong was I!!  The beds were uncomfortable and hard with huge pillows you couldn’t lay your head on, I spent the week sleeping on a cushion from the settee and they wasn’t the worst of it. Had booked 2 beach view rooms which on Expedia website were renovated - what we got was one renovated on the ground floor no beach view and the other was what I could only imagine a room in a bail hostel to look like, on the city side. Not happy as we had paid extra for beach view rooms, so complained to reception who advised they couldn’t do anything until 1 pm the following day at 1pm told new rooms weren’t cleaned so come back at 2 pm. At 2pm rooms offered were only slightly better but not at all to the standard advertised so changed the disgusting city room and kept the ground floor renovated one. Only to find it had no hair  dryer just wires sticking out where it should have been. Our friends room however had a hairdryer in the bathroom but unfortunately only one plug socket in the whole room that made funny noises when you plugged something in. 

Overall view of the rest of the hotel was you get what you pay for.  Breakfast was very average and all areas of the hotel were dirty as were the surrounding areas of the hotel. 

However pool area was nice with plenty of sunbeds so no worry about getting up early to get a bed. 

Experience of service was that we couldn’t be sure if there was a language barrier thing or whether they were just ignoring us and not bringing the change on purpose but it became very annoying. 

Would I recommend this hotel - unfortunately not ☹️"
"Hotel Argana where do I start. It is filthy, with arrogant rude staff, horrible restaurant, broken lifts and all that's before you get to the room. We booked a triple room via Booking.com but when we arrived the room wasn't ready and instead of a triple room we got 2 single beds and eventually a camp bed which was left outside our door. The bidet didn't work, the sink had to be unblocked several times, safe was broken eventhough it was prepaid had to wait 2 days no refund .... When we protested the duty manager who was downright rude and ignorant said all the rooms were the same ... which is a lie if you are to believe the website ... no satisfaction whatsoever... every day there were heated arguments at the reception area with guests over accommodating  .... the majority of whom were European .... Avoid this place at all costs."
"This hotel is far away to achieve 4 stars. I've stayed a few days.
1. Room linked to a noisy boulevard and open window could bring you to deaf
2. The air-conditioner is prehistoric and  don't work and you can't leave the window open because of the terrible noise. Imagine how you can stay in this room during the summer time.
3. All the electric plugs was damaged and out of the walls.
4. Shower head attachment is broken
5. It is not possible to use the usb port of the TV, because is blocked by use of wrong size of wall attachment.
6. Toilet paper is the cheapest worst quality 
7. Room located so far away from the lifts so you have to wolk around all hotel corridors to reach it.
8. Room internet connection is awful."
"If you have ever read any of my reviews you will know that i never run a place down if the place is a little dated or one member of staff riled me a tad, BUT..... when the front of house staff are out and out racist, then i have to say my piece. The order of service was as follows, 1st/ Arabic/French speaking men, 2nd/ Arabic/French speaking women, 3rd/ Other men, 4th/ Other women, and they had no qualms about letting you know. Of the 7 nights we stayed, only on 3 occasions did we eat an evening meal because of the poor quality of the food, i know it was a cheap holiday, but a bowl of bones with some scrag on it, is not what i call food! The pool bar also caters for the locals so do not expect to get served until they have all been seated and served first and whatever you do, do not send the wife to get the drinks or you may have to extend your stay. The rooms are basic and for the price you really can't complain, i didn't supply any pics of the room as the only moan i have is that the bed was very hard, and you can't see a hard bed. The metal framed sliding door to the balcony didn't have a handle so it was impossible to close fully. The staff in the upstairs bar were very good and friendly and other than the chambermaid were the only people who received tips from us on leaving. I managed to kill 3 mozzie's in our room one morning, after being bit... and you would have thought that i was asking for lifes blood when i asked them to spray the room, in the end i was given some spray and did the job myself."
"This has to be one of the dirtiest hotels. It should be knocked down not refurbished. The rooms are not dated they are dirty. Staff are rude and don't know how to deal with people. Dirty rooms, hallways, lifts etc. "
"This is the cheapest hotel you can get in agadir as a tourist. You get what you pay for.
First room was basically unlivable so we got a new one from the EXTREMELY stressed out lobby staff. The AC smelled like sewer."
"Food really bad noise uwant sleep day or night with club next door and hastle uget outside, is just so bad it tirés u out not many local drink places just clubs dont bother itell u it must be the staff that put Alice revue az uwill waite at the desk to get checked in for hour Afta arivel az peaple come in of street to get room for the night they serve thèm be u u Who haz paid and booked discusting  dont bother"
"First room provided was disgusting. You would not have wanted to lie in the beds or even walk bare foot in the floor. Final straw came when the electric sockets wouldn't work! Lacked even the most basic amenities. It was the worst hotel I have ever had the displeasure of staying at. Staff were dire and spoke very little English. Breakfast was terrible. The list goes on and on. We were moved to a 'superior' room which was a tad better but again, nowhere near even three stars, let alone four. No fridge. No safe. Complete disgrace and should be avoided if possible. Luckily we were there for three nights.. Any longer and there was no way we could have stayed at Argana Hotel. "
"My dad and I arrived and were disgusted at the state of the rooms and the corridor/lifts. It is absolutely grimy and dirty. The first room we got given looked nothing like the photos online and the shower didn’t even have a shower head. The state of the room and bathroom was definitely not a 4star so we asked for a better room and were just given one very similar however the cleanliness of this one was a bit better. The majority of the staff are very rude and grumpy and most cannot speak English so it’s very hard to have a standard convo. I noticed that the staff treat Muslim people with more respect such as at breakfast the staff bring over tea and coffee to them and they are a bit more friendlier (all other customers have to go and get it themselves) speaking of breakfast it is an absolute disappointment. Watery eggs, bland beans and dry croissants. Hardly any selection and it’s repetitive every single morning. Also no labelling to tell you what’s what ( couldn’t tell what sausage was being offered whether chicken, beef or pork) (couldn’t tell if the juice was mango or orange) YOU NEED LABELS. I understand that you are a predominately Muslim country but I think you should serve pork as the majority of your customers are European. The only positive out of this disappointing stay was the pool area was fairly clean and well maintained with a friendly guy who came up to my dad and I and asked us to leave a review on TripAdvisor we then went through the list of negatives with him. He then spoke to a manager who then referred us back to reception in hopes of getting another room to satisfy our needs. This room was definitely what I would expect for a 4 star, however the hot water was broken!!! I went to reception 4 times to complain and they kept saying they will send down the technician. However due to the staffs lack of English and basic understanding they meant to tell me that I need to wait in the room for the technician which I only understood after the 3rd attempt of complaining. After an hour the technician finally arrived and fixed it. The general maintenance of the hotel is terrible and there are many safety hazards you need to be aware off. However, I would suggest staying somewhere else. Do not recommend. Rather shut down your hotel and re vamp it as well as get new management."
"Hotel was drab and dirty. Public areas needed the carpets hoovering.fridge in room was noisy and everything kept freezing up.Had to ask for fresh towells 3 times.Reception staff were rude and ignored us. Food was unappetizing and only lukewarm. Pool not heated.
Bar staff and dining staff very nice and helpful. This was supposed to be a 4 star hotel and it certainly wasn't."
"So upon arrival, check in was a quiet Tuesday evening, still extremely slow at booking in guests on their 1980's pc and paperwork. When we were checking in, they told us that we had not paid, so I showed the paperwork and my online banking (+ hotels.com invoice) that it shows we had paid, so we paid the taxes of around £15, they gave us the keys and said we would sort in the morning, well next time i seen the desk they told me it was all sorted, after my holiday, I checked my bank, they had somehow charged my card that hotels.com had already processed!!! I don't know how they even got the card details but even after showing them the payment they still somehow took charge off a card they never actually had the right to do!
But the hotel - worn out tired carpets, everything is 80's old varnished wood stain, rooms are old and fixtures and fittings hanging off the walls, bathrooms are really dirty, baths that have built up dirt on them. WIFI is hit and miss at the best of times, breakfast is ok, same basic stuff daily. The Sunset bar is really nice though, has sports on as our room tv has bbc news only, the staff there are really good and the beer is a decent price. the place was manageable for afew days but 2 1/2 * at best , laughable at 4* . but to find the card has somehow been charged id be careful!"
"Hotel entrance looked impressive as soon as you left the main reception the rest of the hotel  looks tired, dingy and very dark. Broken lifts, wires hanging out, dark and dingy corridors, chipped wood. Poorly maintained. 
Service from reception terrible. Not enough staff on reception, rude and unwelcoming. Our balcony door was broken. Promised that they would send someone up to fix first night within 15 minutes, after an hour no one had come, again went to reception was told 20 minutes. All in all waited 3 hours and still no one came. Next morning went down to complain that no one had been and was told ""you shouldnt have waited in."" Then the receptionist took the room number, turned his back on us and served someone else. Obviously uninterested, not mentioned again and not fixed by the end of the week stay.
Security in the hotel lacking. Came back from evening meal in the resort to a key left in the bedroom door which opened our bedroom door. (not the key used by us). Advised management that a key was found in our door and took the key off us with no explaination or apology. 
Breakfast ok, not enough staff at service, lack of cutlery and crockery every breakfast time Tables not cleaned after been used, just crumbs brushed off and waiters taking cutlery off tables used to set up new tables.
Pool staff friendly however gave some guests  free pool towel hire if they ""put on a good review"".
Cleanliness overall lacking for a so called 4 star hotel this I believe to be due to lack of staffing. 
The positives-
Hotel central, short walk to restaurant, shops and beach 15 minutes. Pool area nice and reception area typically moroccan design with beautiful detail. Bar area lovely and outdoor snack bar good. 
Beds comfortable with plenty of hot water for showers. 
In my opinion budget hotel, not a 4 star. OK for what we paid."
"I had such a roller coaster experience with this hotel! I made a booking of two rooms for 4 people.  When we first arrived, check in took a good 2 hours, I had to go and remind staff that we were here for them to give us the room. One room was ready and they said the other room was still not ready which we did not mind as long as we had the one room ready to freshen up.

Room 1:
-The lock to this room would not work unless we used full force!  
-The bath tub was worn out and looked very dirty as though it had not been cleaned!
- The room was so dark, so some extra lighting is needed!
- The bed itself was very comfortable and was made everyday to a good standard!

Room 2:
Room 2 was an absolute nightmare! Firstly we were waiting hours for the room to be ""cleaned"" and when we finally got the room, it was disgusting! There was blood over the bed sheets, blood on the hand towels, no mini fridge ( that was not a concern to be fair) and dust everywhere. We were in complete shock as we were told the room was being cleaned for all these hours to come and find it in this state! I went down to reception who laughed it off and said they would send someone up to clean it up. 1 hour later and we were still waiting for something to be done so I went back down  where I was told I was lying about the blood! Luckily I had taken pictures which shocked the reception man and he called his manager who said this will be sorted within 30 minutes. 45 minutes later we was still waiting for this to be resolved- we are tired and hungry at this point. Luckily I have some Moroccan friends who called up the hotel and had some words. 10 minutes after the call we were given a brand new room( it only took us over 6 hours to get a room yay). It is such a shame we had to wait so many hours and receive rude staff for this situation to be resolved! 

Room 3:
Room 3 was brilliant compared to the other rooms! Everything was clean and there was no blood stains anywhere! We only had two issues- one being there was not enough lighting and secondly, when we went to have a shower there was no where to put the shower head! Luckily we had 2 rooms so we had to shower in the other room!!

We opted for the breakfast service which was of a good standard, the food was fresh and the service from the workers was amazing!

The setting of the hotel was beautiful, we got some amazing pictures, especially at the pool and the front of the hotel by the water fountain.

There was an Egyptian staff member who was very helpful, although we had so many issues at the beginning, he made our experience amazing and was lovely to talk to! The security was good to, they always greeted us politely and helped us when we needed a taxi. Overall most of the staff were lovely and always wanted a chat which we enjoyed, it it just such a shame we had the room situation as certain staff members really did make the trip a good experience.

The actual location of the hotel was really good for us! Most things were of walking distance and if we needed a taxi it was only for short journeys."
"We spent a week in the Argana Hotel and we were really disappointed with it overall. 
Positive: The pool was nice, the cleaner was lovely and our towels were changed daily and there was a lovely tall doorman who was friendly. That's the only positives!
Negatives:  The reception staff were rude and not attentive we had issues with our key everytime we left the room and had to get it changed which meant we had to stand at the reception waiting for them to attend. They basically ignored us and attended other customers first. The breakfast was limited and did not cater for Irish/English clients there was no fresh fruit and the plates were all chipped. We didn't eat in the hotel at all and had to find other places. The sun loungers were dirty and were not washed down. The decor was old, poorly lit in the corridors, walls were dirty, carpet was dirty and one of the lifts was broken which they were working on it all week ( noise was awful ).  The room was ok, the shower was hot but the air con smelt and made a noise. The glass on the balcony was filthy. There is a nightclub next door which plays loud music until the early hours. We would not recommend staying here. 
Places to go to eat which we liked included: Little Norway, Salam Burger (turn left when you walk out the hotel front door and walk to the end of the street turn left again and it is the second burger shop and La Plage Bleue down by the beach (do lovely omelettes with fresh bread)."
"We arrive on Saturday before check in order to wait till 2 pm No welcome drink of tea here 
We went to pool  bar order water my partner a beer Everything is old tired and not clean 
My partner went to check in as order at 2 pm 
He came back told me the room was nothing like the pictures on teletext site 
I saw room thought I was in episode of bang up abroad flirt look flea ridden bed 
My partner complain at reception but he was unwilling to stay 
Since this time we have spoken to locals told us this  is 2 star hotel extremely run down 
"
"My friend and I arrived at this hotel late in the evening, to be greeted by unfriendly and rude staff. After waiting to be served for almost half an hour, we were taken up to our room - which I must say was a sight from a horror movie!
The corridors leading up to the rooms were dark and dingy - no lighting, we had to resort to using our mobile phone torch! The room itself was horrible, cold, unhygienic and too basic. We were on the 2nd or 3rd floor I can't quite remember, but one look at it and we knew we could not stay here any longer.
Reception staff said we would need to stay here one night until arrangements could be made to move us elsewhere, but to be honest the standard of this hotel was so low we just wanted to leave. As we had booked through Love Holidays, the hotel could not refund our money back - but as long as we had the option to go elsewhere I think that's all we needed.
Please re-consider if looking to book here. The rooms look nothing like in the pictures - perhaps they are pictures of rooms right at the top but either way, very misleading."
"We arrived 12 noon Saturday to be told our room was not yet ready. We returned after 2pm and after a long wait at reception we were taken to our room. It was dirty with cigarette burns in the net curtains, doors were hanging off the dressing table. No hot water in the bathroom, grey towels. We immediately went back to reception insisting we would not stay in this room. 0124 (We’d requested a sea view room and this room had no view). After a long wait again in reception we were taken to another room (0115) and told it was only for one night, so we reluctantly accepted it. We wouldn’t shower in the horrible over bath shower and did not unpack after the promise of a much better room the next day. The Manager (Abderrahim)then promised us room 4120 which was a sea view room the next day. (Monday). We were told to leave our luggage in reception and as we’d a half day tour booked for 9am they said our room would be ready when we returned. We saw Abderrahim insert our names on their booking system into room 4120 as he wasn’t on duty until later  the next day. When we returned Monday afternoon we were told that 4120 had been allocated to someone else, when Abderrahim came on duty he was genuinely surprised at the error and gave us 4126 which was acceptable. At last I could unpack after 48 hours! The public areas were ok, the bar, restaurant and pool bar areas were clean and nicely decorated, Sahid at the pool bar and his staff very courteous, but everyone we spoke to had the same complaint about the awful rundown rooms. Abderrahim and Yassine (reception staff)  were very helpful and tried their best to make us happy in the chaotic situation which existed. The rooms were cleaned every day but all “white” towels were grey and one day the smell on them was awful. Pool towels are provided for a deposit of  100 D per towel refunded at the end of holiday with the return of the towels (which you can change daily).  Ahmed, the pool attendant works hard, is very pleasant and extremely helpful. The hotel is situated just a short stroll to the “prom” where there are bars and restaurants. The restaurant at the hotel was nice and clean with buffet style breakfast and dinner, the food being well presented with a good choice daily. . All waiting staff were very friendly and helpful. All in all we thought the Moroccan people were extremely friendly and would possibly return to Agadir but not to this hotel, unless the bedrooms are refurbished. Finally we had booked a private transfer (airport to hotel and return)  which went exceedingly smoothly. Stay here if you will, but you have been told our experience of what to expect. This hotel is 2star at best and we would never have booked, but hindsight is a wonderful thing. "
"I never write reviews about places I stay but in this case i think its important for people to know what this hotel is like. To start off with the staff in the hotel are fantastic, really can't do enough for you. Me and my partner have been at the hotel for 2 days. 

On arrival we were greeted by the reception staff arguing with some lads from Leeds (England) about room accommodation. The first room we was given was lower floor 33, let's just say we walked in and it looked like a bomb had hit it. Doors hanging off, tiles broken, walls falling to bits, blood stain on the bath, balcony door broken, lighting terrible, basically a dungeon. I asked at reception for a change of rooms which was accommodated the next day at 1pm. This time we was given a room on the 3rd floor, again refrigerator missing, tv not working, shower terrible, tiles hanging off the wall, stains on the bed, just really poor. As for the hotel, it's old and worn. Carpets need replacing, place never gets hovered, food is terrible! And I mean terrible! All tastes bland, and being full board I'd expect at least a glass of water but no! Got to buy a bottle. Around the pool, not to bad fairly clean. Guys behind the bar are nice and try to help with everything. The sun lounges are old and worn, the price for bottles off beer is expensive, and they dont even give you a pint pot to drink out of. The facilities around the hotel are poor, the gym isnt anywhere to be seen, the area itself looks derelict and battered. The walk to the sea front is a good 15 mins, but the seafront is a lovely area with nice bars and restaurants which I would definitely go for instead of having the hotel food. There is no iron for your clothes so I suggest you bring one. Me and my partner have walked to the marina which is nice and spent time in the bars in the front. We are both late 20s early 30s and like a bit if entertainment, the hotel on the other hand has no entertainment or if there is I have not seen it. Today we went to the crocoparc which was around £7 each and absolutely brilliant loved every minute, and also went the market Souk Al Ahad which is also really good. We have 5 days left, and we are just going to enjoy the sun and try to do more excursions. But honestly anyone who can say this is a 4 star clearly hasn't stopped in a 4 star before. My advice pay more and stay in the Riu Tikida or somewhere else because the Argana Is old and dated and falling to bits. "
"I’ve stayed in this hotel for five days.. 
the hotel was dirty, my room was dirty. 
When we arrived we asked three times at the reception for our room to be cleaned and all the three times the room was still dirty.
The bathroom had a problem with the shower.. every time we took a shower the water came out of it and the floor was all wet.
The breakfast was simple but the room where we had it was dirty as well.. 
I wouldn’t recommend this hotel to anyone!"
"Definitely NOT a 4 star even by Moroccan standards! Waiting for check-in is usually 1-2 hours and typical for many guests. The Hotel Manager is completely disinterested in hearing of any issues and doesnt involve himself in any customer matters. The whole hotels needs a deep clean and decor refresh. Carpets are diry and sticky, lift didnt work, rooms are very very tired - there are approx 10 modern rooms (Junior Suites), only go for these if you can.
The saving grace is ANAS on reception (along with YASIN) - ANAS particularly tried extremely hard to manage and deliver on customer expectations and should be the manager here.
Note - the vast majority of staff are hard working and trying their best but are working with very limited resources and completely ineffective poor management - it is not the fault of the staff."
"We stayed here 1 week in September and it was not a great experience. This is a  very badly run hotel, management need to step up and sort this place out. Check in was very slow, worse by the fact when we got our room it was dreadful!! There was no balcony and we were on a main road which was very noisy, there was no hairdryer (when it stated there was one on the web site) no remote for the tv, no fridge again (web site states there is one in every room) not a single hanger in the wardrobe, mattress was lumpy and pillows like sandbags. It was horrible, i went to reception and was told next day i could change rooms as they were full, we got moved the next day, but couldn't get in the room till 3pm and when we went up it had not been cleaned, it was filthy. I had to demand a maid come and clean it right away as they were ruining my holiday, it took half hour to get house keeping to come up. Once we got this sorted out our holiday could begin and we could actually unpack and this was 4pm on the second day by then. The corridors are filthy, and hardly saw any cleaning staff, I would say this hotel is understaffed and very badly managed, the first room we were given is a disgrace to let out unless you reduce the price and say why!! Can not recommend this hotel at the minute and 4* it definitely is not, the shame is it has great potential and the foyer and entrance is really nice, some great murals on the walls and just needs a total make over and get the dirty red carpet up as it is awful. The one person that was really helpful on reception Adarim, he is lovely, the older guy and women just don't want to know and were unhelpful, the waiters and and bar staff are lovely but would not go back again. Can really recommend the massage there though, we had a full body and it was amazing and not expensive. Also your sleep is ruined by a nearby night club at the hotel behind which play loud music till 5am in the morning every night!!"
"this hotel is massively understaffed and a disaster waiting to happen stayed  here for a week with my partner 14 to 21 september Firstly it should not take an hour and a half to check in at 3.00 pm we were told the cleaners were in the room. Now it must be said the reception and common areas on ground level are nice in morrocan design however once you enter the old shakey lift that only holds 3 people second lift never worked the whole week and exit on your floor you realise your staying in a dump. All room doors and frames were old damaged  and the corridor walls were filthy also the carpet was badly worn and ill fitting sticky to walk on and just plain dirty.All these corridors remained in dire need of cleaning the whole week we were there .The room we were shown to was on fourth floor and sea view upon entering immediately after cleaners it looked like a bomb had hit it fithy pillows pillow cases cover on bed floor sticky and dirty stains on balcony doors and mirrors unable to close said door exposed wiring at wall sockets and lamps that were hanging off fittings bath toilet and bidet were old worn cracked stained and dirty and greasey to the touch walls were stained and dirty.the sea view consisted of an old abandoned hotel directly opposite. We immediately demanded to be moved and were told nothing could be done until the next day.Lunch time sunday we were moved to what can be described as marginally better but with a new problem.Again we had to have all bed linen changed because of stains but when i turned on the tap in bathroom vomit backed up into sink and just stayed there apart from being disgusting it proves the cleaners do sod all when in the room.Eventually our concerns were basically addressed but not to a very satisfactory level. Sunday night we decided to eat at the hotel buffet big mistake terrible selection basically 2 types of chicken and a spicey sausage and salad but hey it wasnt too expensive or so we thought cost us the whole of monday as we both had terrible stomach cramps and diarrhea.As the week wore on and we spoke to other guests we found we werent the only ones with stomach problems and a lot of people had experienced bed bugs it was only then i realised i too had bites on my ankles and feet .In conclusion the ARGANA hotel is at best a 2 star that needs to be closed and completly updated all rooms bathrooms and cooridors are a medical hazard . It the rooms dont make you sick the food will abosolute disgrace that tour operator are selling this property to holiday makers regadrless of what there charging old and worn is one thing but dirty and unhygenic is something else entirely .When was the last time someone from any of the tour operators inspected this establishment"
"For the price, you can debate what to expect.

I am writing this half way through my trip, as from yet another encounter of short changing me I felt the need to make this review.

Firstly, it not beach side hotel, can be a steep walk but no problems for us, just a note for anyone looking.

Hotel and room quality (besides our problems) is very good for the price.
The service from the reception, while they try their best just wasn't good enough.
The service from the pool bar I would say to avoid as much as you can.

The evening bar/lounge is very good, the prices, the staff, the decor... Recommended greatly, like a totally different company.

I travelled with my wife and we don't expect any luxuries, but what we expect is to not be treated badly by reception and the pool bar.

Our check-in on arrival (10:30pm) - we was given a room with faulty balcony door.

They said they will send technician, we waited over an hour, still nothing, so we went back to reception and tthey asked to come back in the morning 10am to change rooms, as they didn't have one available at this time. (?)

We came at 10am after a mediocre continental breakfast, to be told they won't have a room ready until 2am.

So we returned after 2am, after much struggle we was given a room with the same problem, we asked again for a new room, and finally given a third room which was fine, no complaints after this regarding our room.

Our first day in the pool bar while waiting for our room, the staff their tried to over charge us, when questioned we was made to believe we are mistaken, after speaking to someone who appeared to be more superior, we got our correct money back.

Today, similar situation in the pool bar, this time the superior guy dealing with us. Our bill 160dh, I give 200dh... For some reason they cannot give us change for 40dh...
He gives 20dh and says later give back 20dh.. 
He comes back to take my 20dh and says he will give 40dh back in a moment.. 
After 20minutes I ask about this 40dh.. he sneakily gives what I thought was 40dh and asks me questions to what I now believe was to distract me... As when I walked away I only had 20dh...

On return he just says ""excuse me"" and ties to apologise, I had my 40dh finally.

Excluding this situation, and assuming no more happens, for the price, it's a very nice hotel.

Just be smart, be aware of the prices and make sure your room is adequate.

Would I come back? For the same price, most certainly... I travelled with a small budget (Agadir is not cheap by any means).
If you can spend a bit extra, then do so for a more better experience.

I would have given 5/5 if these 3 experiences did not happen, all without any sincere apology."
"Do not stay at this hotel. It is filthy and the staff are rude. Booked in here on 31 Aug 2019. The reception staff are incompetent. They are dealing with 6 different things at one time so check in can take hours. We were given room 3135 and while we were being shown to the room the Porter said that if we weren't happy with our room we should go to reception after breakfast next day to request a change. The room we were in was old dreary dirty and needed to be updated. There were stains and scrapes on the walls. The bed cover had stains and the bathroom was filthy. The bath was old and badly worn. The furniture had lumps out of it and it needed to be thrown out. The pictures of the rooms in brochures and on the website are reflective on about 20 of the rooms in the hotel out of 238. I requested a better room the next day and was shown to 2 rooms that were in a similar condition to the room I was in and then the receptionist wanted e150 to upgrade met their superior suites as they called them. The carpets in the common areas were worn and dirty and even a hoovering did nothing. While we were the the electricity went off but only came on in the hallway. After 1 and 1/2 hrs in the dark I had to go to reception to get them to sort the problem and they were very rude about having to do it. People were also asleep fully stretched on the sofas in the lobby. We stayed 1 night and moved to another hotel the next day. Don't not stay here. Save your money and book somewhere else."
"5 1/2 hrs to book in, wasted day, no toiletries on arrival, no toilet roll, dirty sheets, carpets, towels, stinks of sewage, reception were rude, no manners, not helpful, hand dryer broken, no sky tv, no radio, no room service,no spa, no massage, noise around pool, we had to leave everyday, cockroach beach 15 minute walk, were hassled by beach sales and beggars as young as 4 yrs old,we complained and nothing done, no Thomas cook rep, no one to call or talk to, people were going to other hotels and checking out, disgusted at Argana, breakfast, no plates no cups no cutlery, no chairs or tables, had to stand to eat, no o/j no fruit, food is terrible, upset stomach, people handled food and put it back, power cuts, no emergency lighting, no life guard in pool area, not a relaxing holiday, totally stressful, noisy pumping music, , sunbed fights, putting towels on beds at 7 am, overall disgusting place, do not book here, should not be advertised as a 4 star, not even 2. Could not stay at hotel as noisy, smelly, trip hazards everywhere, could not wait to leave and come home, we want a refund, totally the worst hotel ever. "
"Omg,,,this hotel was awful,,
On arrival in afternoon, was given card/key for room, no escort to room it was a case of find it yourself, 
The room was ok ,just had to get handyman to fix balcony door as a big screw stopped it opening, also waited for safe to be reset, neither was done till next afternoon as I had to keep asking at front desk,,the people on front desk ,not a welcome or smile or a word from them all week unless needed to go to them for anything,,
For 2 days the room was not cleaned,and other days no towels which I waited 3hours for after coming back from a mountain trek,,
Tea was served in the foyer regularly ,the glasses dirty & some with lipstick on them ,the carpets were dirty & parts stuck up near elevator you could trip over it ,,
They advertise the hotel is beside beach ,,its a good walk to there and if you dont ask at desk they dont tell you where the sunbed area for hotel is ,,,not helpful there at all ,and I would not recommend the hotel,,,,

Overall visit to Morocco,,,the trips to Maracheck, Atlas Mountains, Moroccan Nite were good, they kept me going and out of hotel,,,"
"We did wait almost 2 hours to CHECK IN and the staff weren't even sorry for that!
The rooms are sooo freaking old especially the bathrooms & the beds.
The WIFI did not work at all during all our stay which was frustrating because we had to go till the lobby to get connected
We booked a room in front of the sea and we found ourselves in front of old buildings and the sea view was quiet far. The breakfast was disgusting!
One of the worst HOTELS"
"Not impressed by this hotel, its definitely not 4 star. The hotel is not very clean, it seems that there are less staff to cater for breakfast. Its not great at catering for a family of 6, the wireless is very flaky.  The hotel is not great at communication, there was no water for a day at the hotel, we weren't informed by the staff as to what to do in that situation.
I wouldn't recommend it for a family."
"Stayed here for 7 nights with my bestfriend. It was horrific. No hot water in our room, breakfast was appalling, staff were very unhelpful, there was no water on our last day. Bedrooms were not like the photos at ALL"
"I visited the pool with some friends last week , it was very dirty and not well maintained, the bathroooms lacked minimum hygiene and fhe food tasted horrible and wasn't  worth the price at all , not to mention that the staff made us write positive reviews on tripadvisor !! Wouldn't recommend at all !!"
"I got to Argana Hotel at 11:30am, Room not as advertised, not clean, very unprofessional kept. Garage/industrial unit outside noise all day.
No wifi in the room
TV not working
AC not working as to its potential 
No blankets
No fridge for medication
Window left open and dust inside the room 
Poor service from main desk, being ignored and left. Said would fix some issue but still haven't. Staff are rude. 
Un hygienic bathroom. Only one light works in the bathroom, no ventilation in bathroom.

Well my 6 friends arrived about 11:00pm to the hotel, we booked an paid for the rooms in January 2019 they said they didn't have any rooms left and we need to go next door to a different hotel which was worse from the ratings online. 
What a start to our holiday and worst experience ever. 

I have to add, the next day the hotel gave us a time of 9am to sort out the rooms, they said come back at 12 midday but still no room as they were being cleaned but by 2pm we got our rooms, I got a fresh room with a fridge and balcony and so did the rest. One room was upgraded to a supreme which was amazing. 

It was an experience I guess, from then onwards the holiday was great, not talking about the hotel there."
"Initially once we got to the hotel we found out they had double booked us (& 90 others!!) they refused to give us a room & told us to find another hotel! We were furious as we paid for a room. Eventually 48 hours later we got our room. But daily we were chasing for the rooms to be cleaned & for clean towels too. On one of the days our room got cleaned at 8.30pm?! Bedding had stains too. Fridge doesn’t work either. Hotel reception staff very rude. U get ignored & they keep fobbing u off. The truth is the exterior is very deceiving to say the least as the inside is far from as glamorous! This hotel ruined our holiday big time. Hotel breakfast was decent & do was the dinner. No evening entertainment as advertised. The restaurant staff were only nice to the french & ignored the rest of us. The pool entertainment was decent & fun though. If ur desperate only book this place or don’t waste your hard earned money like many of us did. Iv read many bad reviews about this place & take it from me whose just got back 48 hours ago, they were spot on! "
"Don’t be deceived by these pictures online! Hotel was absolutely disgusting! Bedding is never changed they only make the bed, everything is falling apart in the rooms. Towels were horrible and smelt. My hotel key wouldn’t work and they suggested to slide a card on the side to open the door!!! No fridge in one of the rooms, tv wouldn’t work, Internet was rubbish. Constant leak in the bathroom and shower was horrible too. Overall I have nothing nice to say about this hotel, receptionist’s were very unhelpful. It was my birthday when I arrived and my sister asked them to do a little something for me and no one bothered they just kept avoiding us every time we walked past. We struggled with our luggage when leaving too and no one helped!! Horrible stay! "
"First day the bathroom was dirty,also for 2 days the room was not cleaned by the cleaner. Receptionists are rude they do not know how to show good customer service. I wont be coming back to this hotel. In reality the hotel bedrooms are not nice."
"In this hotel, so many bad things happened:
- slowest check-in ever
- bathroom door NOT closable (I even called the manutentor who just told me that I was right, without even suggesting to change room)
- empty fridge, and NO glasses
- the key-card was not working, we had to change it three times before getting the chance to enter our room
- TV not working
- Safe-lock not working
- Private beach NOT close, it's actually 25 minutes by foot, they said 5 minutes
They say it's a four stars, I believe it's actually not even 2 stars standard."
"The worst hotel I've ever been in Morocco. So so so old. Needs to be closed down for renovation. Thanks God I only stayed there for 3 nights. You'd rather stay home than spend vacation there. No lights on in the corridor close to my room.  The other lights are full of spiders' nets. Dirty. Horrible food, got a stomach ache. The AC smells moisture.  Closet smells urine. I urge you to run away from this hotel."
"Some basic services are ok. Hot water, bathroom cleanliness and bed comfort.

But these essentials no. 
Useless Wi-Fi! 
No sockets.
Security at the room. 

And. 
I booked a twin bed but gave me 2 individual beds. 
Gel and shampoo scarce. 
Breakfast coffee is undrinkable, scrambled eggs dry, powder orange juice. 
The hotel doesn't take on responsibility on your ""lost"" items of the room (see pic).
The restaurant of the pool can not charge to your room and has few chances. "
"Absolutely rubbish, I would not recommend this hotel at all, first day we checked in after almost 4 hours on a coach from Marrakesh we’ve been given one room with no lights where my mother in law was staying (she’s 75 years old) and my room I had to spend at least 15min to unlock it, the receptionist sent the maintenance guy to have a look at it and he said to me “oh this room you need a *technic* to unlock it” this was my face O_o 
I did not travel all the way from London to learn a technic for unlocking a stupid door. 
Went to reception and asked to be moved right away the guys says they’re fully booked and that he will make a note and next day first thing in the morning they will change us. 
Next day I went to reception and it was a different person that had no idea on who I was or why I’m there, when I said to him “good morning, I’m here to swap my rooms as this that happened yesterday” the guy goes “no no no, you’re not here to swap the rooms you’re here to request new rooms” at this point I’ve lost it and made a scene in the reception area called hotels.com as I originally booked with them I was in reception with my 75 year old mother in law, my wife and her 14 year old niece in reception from 9am to 2pm. Because I had to wait until all rooms are clean. I spoke with reception, reception manager, Hotels.com however no one could do anything about it. People have been checking out since 9am as I’ve seen them handing over their keys, they didn’t care to prioritise our rooms. 
At check out even though I paid and had proof of it the receptionist tried to make me pay again as in his system showed a balance and I had a confirmation saying everything was paid!! 
I would recommend hotel Mabrouk which is right behind this rubbish Argana hotel. "
"Having stayed at the Organic hotel many times over the last 15 years I haven't stayed for 5 years and I was very disappointed to find that it is really deteriorated on arrival no member of staff actually explains anything to you I spoke to many people who are visiting for the first time and they didn't know that there was a bar in the garden or place to eat in the garden or that you could have shisha or that there was a nightclub it seems to be kept very secret and for local business men and ladies of the night who like to party the hotel itself seems to be dwindling I was really shocked at the lack of choice of food in the restaurant boat for breakfast and for dinner I had to say to the Head waiter a few times and he was very kind and actually had a teddy made for me I cannot fault the staff at the restaurant they do everything that they can with very limited things to offer the customer I went every day to change money and I was told everyday that there was no money to exchange so I had to walk around to The Exchange Centre which was fine my bedroom was actually fine although my fridge was actually a freezer so all my drinks throws it was cleaned every day and that was fine there is just an overall feeling of weariness within the hotel like there's no life in it it's very dark internally and the pool guy was really nice except the same song played non-stop from morning until evening every single day it was a piano piece like something you would hear in a massage centre and drove me nearly crazy I would say the best member of staff in the place is Hamza at the pool everybody was complaining about the hotel lack of facilities bad service I really felt I had to defend the place at times because so many people were complaining who knew I had been there many times and I've been to Morocco over the past 15 years I honestly I'm not sure that I would ever stay in the hotel again I didn't feel rested but I understand it's cheap and cheerful and I suppose people shouldn't expect too much it's lost its sparkle I would just like to mention the brown dirty carpets that leads from the restaurant then up the stairs it really should be replaced it gives the impression of disinterest and dirty I love Morocco I really think that they should appoint somebody to explain all the facilities that are in the hotel not one person I spoke to round the pool knew that there was a spa downstairs with the could have massage and beauty treatments and waxing etc it was well hidden and the Beautiful bar area in the garden which I have been to in the past most people thought that they were just lights that flash just nice they didn't realise it was a bar of course we all know that the ladies of the night come out to the bars that's just part and parcel of life in Morocco I've seen it for years but I really wish that they would encourage the European customers to visit this lovely bar with the shisha and the food"
"Ouytside of this hotel and swimming pool area is amazing but the rooms, were we spend our night and resting time, was very uncomfortable and did not feel clean, sheets were yellow, covering a lot of the stains, but there were many visible ones even on yellow bedsheets. The owner needs to invest in the rooms and the ratings will go up by a lot as the staff are amazing and do everything they can to help!"
"DO NOT COME HERE. The bell hop hit on me and kept suggesting that “all American women are beautiful”. When he showed me to my room he lingered. I questioned why this was and then found out that the hotel has a brothel connected to it. The room was filthy - hairs on my pillow case, the door did not have a dead bolt, the doors to the balcony did not lock, reeked of smoke, the remote controller to the tv did not work, the safe did not work, there was no information for WiFi, the light in the hallway did not work, the toilet didn’t flush, breakfast was limited 6:30-9:30 (typically Morocco wakes up late, most places I’ve been to serve until 11), there was LOUD MUSIC UNTIL 6 am. 

It’s not far from the CTM bus station and the manager gave me my second night’s stay payment back - but that is not redeeming for how unclean, outdated, and how sketchy the place is."
"This is my fourth visit to Morocco, having visited Marrakesh a number of times.
This is my first visit to Agadir, I am actually sat on my flight writing this review - absolutely seething.
Me and my family decided to choose Argana hotel from the advice of teletext holidays UK. This was A 7night holiday hence the importance of residency.
We landed on the 7th February at around 20:30 local time, our stay was half board (breakfast and evening meal incl),
On arrival at the hotel the porter (was very kind) took our luggage to our room, as the dinner was close to closing (21:00) he was very pleasant and humble (I searched for him on my departure to give him a tip, but to no avail),
The chap at the reception was very ignorant / abrupt absolutely no idea why? I was with my wife and child, he asked for the local tax which I didn’t hesitate to pay, This was 48 dirhams, I gave 100, he asked if I could call later for the change as he didn’t have any, I asked for a receipt for the tax paid, he said he would give me this in the morning with the change, I kindly said ok.
On entry into the restaurant we was received with a complete shock of the fact we must pay for any beverage we consume with our included meal - an utter disgrace In my view when the meal is included in the stay, iv never heard or experienced such nonsense ever having to purchase water for my included meal In A hotel restaurant, 
I paid the 20dms due for the water I Purchased on the night and then on Departure earlier today I was asked to pay this again, luckily the waiter who I paid was working, I had him called up and detested this payment face to face, he was scratching his nose with his tail in between his legs.
On arrival into our room, the room was decent sized, two single beds joined together to make a double which was rather annoying as x2 quilts, the water in the shower was some days hot, other days luke warm.
The extraction fans in the bathroom x2 did not extract an inch of air.
The heater in the room stunk of sewage when used, I asked for a repair for this on a piece of card hanging on my room door handle. This was never repaired.
The bath had hair in this.
In the end it took me 3 follow on visits to the reception for the tax payment and receipt, like getting blood from a stone.

My advice - if you’re with the family, choose this place at your peril. 

Mr AZAM.

"Had a week at the Hotel Argana in  December and was disappointed.  My room was nothing like the photos.  There was a fridge which didn't work, neither did the air conditioning, the only tv programme in English was BBC news and I couldn't watch that as it flashed constantly. The bath water was brown, I complained about it and then got beige until it went brown again.  The room was really cold, and even with 2 blankets supplied it was cold in bed.  The door to the balcony was so stiff to open I only managed to open it enough to squeeze through, and then had to struggle to close it again. The corridors weren't lit in the morning and as it was winter and dark until 8.30am I had to use a torch to get to the main stairs. The food is awful, don't expect anything written in English, you just have to go on the look of it.  The only resemblance to English food was dried scrambled eggs in the mornings.  The sweets were just small squares of cake with different coloured icing.  The best food was the bread and the coffee was good.  Being a sole traveller I was told not to sit at the table with dead flowers, I was moved to the one next to it without any flowers and told the one with dead flowers was for couples.  How welcoming is that.  The location is not good.  You have to go down several scruffy streets and stairs to the beach.  Unfortunately, there are beggars everywhere and it made the whole experience unpleasant.   There's a club next to the hotel which is loud. There isn't any hotel information in the room and when you ask for anything some of the staff have no English and others a bit of English.  I had to wait 2 days to get a remote for the TV.  There are some lovely local bars and cafes where the food is not only good but cheap as well."
"Please avoid this hotel, on the surface the hotel looks alright different seating areas downstairs with lovely paintings, but after that it is awful.
The reception staff are rude and dismissive, they did not want to deal with any of the problems we had from day one.
The air conditioning did not work, we requested it to be looked at every day till we went home but nothing was done even the reception Manager assured us it would be looked at but never was!!!  It took them 4 days to sort a hairdryer, on the first night  we went to try and get a snack as it was late they charged us for a full meal in the restaurant £16 when we only had some salad and drink (it was closing in 5mins). We eventually got it refunded (they were not happy).
The pool is hardly manned for towels etc.
The surrounding noise from other hotels was really loud and went on to 4am so could not have balcony window open to compensate for the air conditioning not working.
The hotel was not clean dirty worn carpets, dodgy electric sockets and constant smell in room. We even had a cockroache in our room and they just laughed.
The reception and bar staff's attitude was disgusting, especially towards women!
Avoid this hotel at all costs👎👎👎"
"The hotel has wonderful décor and nooks and crannies downstairs but having spent a week there, 3 days and no hot water, the air con was a grill in the wall that blew out air -the pool-side bar was not attended enough by staff, they never had any change to give one always had to wait, other travellers reported it was the same in the upstairs bar - only some of the staff were friendly - we left sign outside for room cleaning - did not happen, then had to go to reception for fresh towels - I enjoyed the holiday but would not stay in this hotel again and it was not the cheapest option at the time"
"After looking at the pictures and seeing that the hotel was a 4* thought we would give it a try. Lobby and entry are very nice with the Moroccan decor, but once you leave that area the hallways look like a cheap hotel in Las Vegas. The hallways are filthy covered with hair and dust definitely have not been vacuumed in months. Then when walked in the room they smelled so bad like air freshener mixed with mixed with bowl cleaner. They then got us another room that smelled better, but had balls of hair stuck on the blanket and the hair was not mine. After this I told my husband we are leaving and went and stayed at Palais de Rose. If you have allergies or are sensitive to smells or just want to have a clean hotel room Hotel Argana is not for you. One other thing this Hotel should not have 4stars and I think they should be re-evaluated immediately."
"This was suppose to be a 4 star but more like a 2.5 star at the most we spent 7 days there on half board and the buffet consisted of about 4 main dishes which were not appealing to say the least. The drinks were not included and had to buy drinks for the evening meals, they were expensive. There was only watermelon as fruit and about 3 desserts all small cakes or biscuits not all that. 

The breakfast was ok but mainly croissants and pancakes. The plates were not very clean and you had to ask for forks and knives which took about 5 mins to come, your food was cold by the time they came.

The hotel had rubbish entertainment. They had one table tennis table and one snooker table no entertainment for kids. In 6 nights we had entertainment on 3 nights and that was just average nothing wow.

The carperts were filthy not been hoovered for the whole week we were there. The Air conditioning was rubbish the rooms were ok not too bad and we had to pay tax although were not made aware when booked it through love holidays. On the first day was told you owe about £75 by a man at reception but when payed it on the last day a lady took a payment of £40 so they couldn't even work that out properly. Also said had to restaurants but when I went to the other one it was a snack bar and you had to pay!!
 
Definitely would not recommend staying here."
"We are here a the minute and to say this would not be our favourite hotel is an understatement. We arrived on Sunday had to change room because of the noise from reception area. No problem moving us.I took my beer back to our room and tonight when I want back to the bar the Bar man quizzed on where his class was I told him it was in my room and he said I had to bring it back.i reported him to the guy on reception and will go further with it tomorrow.the hotel could do with a good over haul and the carpets a good hovering the food is ok but the same every day. our waiter in the dinning area he is the most helpful person here."
"This hotel was very disappointing and definitely not a 4 star quality hotel.
The rooms are very dated with old, chipped, black painted furniture. The tv wasn't working although reported nothing was done about it. Air conditioning was not working and the room was often warmer than outside on the balcony..luckily it wasn't very hot on most days. Bathroom was clean but towels were grey and looked to be used in one of the rooms we booked. Towels were missing sometimes also.

Corridor carpets were filthy and in one particular spot you could see a thick layer of dust- not cleaned in all the time we were there!

Breakfast was very poor with no choice at all - hot food consisted of plain rice, scrambled eggs and grilled tomatoes. I was surprised that the evening meal was tasty although again very little choice. 

We stayed for 4 nights only but will not stay here again and if we had to visit again would likely stay at a bigger international hotel where hopefully 4 star is 4 star...I would say it was more 2-3 star.!! Very very poor!"
"Changed our room 3 times on arrival to find a room which was habitable. Amongst problems encountered
No air conditioning
No lights
Smell in room
No water supplied
Twin needs instead of double bed
Shower not working
Manager never available (obviously hiding in the back office)
By UK standards this is under 3 star. Advertised by Thomas Cook as 4.6 star.
Very poor meal choice. 
Is that enough to put you off ?
Any good reviews put on this site are obviously by the staff themselves. 
Only reason we enjoyed holiday was because we were determined to do so. 
Can't even get towels at the pool.
The list is endless. 
Carpets look like they were never cleaned.
Only good thing.  They have a lovely pool.
No sense of hygiene in the place anywhere. 
Staff lying to you all the time but they can't do anything else as Management not interested. 
"
"Had booked in here for one week to enjoy a week in the sun. From the moment we arrived it was the holiday from hell. We arrived to the hotel at 1am for check in, we were given a room and told tomorrow they would change it if we didn’t like it. The room was pitch black with NO electricity, there was no towels supplied and we were left looking out onto an area that could only be described as a rubbish tip. The following morning we requested a room change. We were told to come back at 2pm. I queued for an hour at reception while staff dealt with other guests of the hotel badly. I eventually gave up waiting and went down to the pool to try and enjoy my ‘holiday’. At 6pm I returned to reception to be met by the most arrogant receptionist I’ve ever encountered. He was smug and laughs at my request. Said the hotel was gull and there was no other rooms for me. Eventually he threw a key at me for another room and said this is all he had. The room was on the ground floor of the hotel, it was filthy. Again there was no clean towels available. We took this room and ended up in the local shop buying bleach to clean it ourselves. The smell of damp was horrendous in the room. The balcony was littered and hadn’t been washed or swept for weeks. I will upload pictures of the bathroom. This is what we met as we walked into the room. Mould and leaking water all over the place. All I can say about Argana hotel is stay well away, they do not value the guests in and shape or form. My partner is a very bad asthmatic and on arrival home ended up in the doctor with a flare up cause by the mould in this hotel!!!"
"Visited this hotel this month for a holiday,nothing compared to how it looks online,rooms were dirty and shabby no double beds,staff were arrogant and not as helpful.Wouldnt recommend this to anyone looking for a holiday here especially British tourists."
"- arrived at hotel for 12.00 rooms not ready 
- reception was very disorganised and incompetent, not helpful at all to guests arriving
- their attitude during the stay did not get better,the door to the balcony was not working, hair dryer broken, safe not working, complain to reception numerous times, promised but never resolved, certain instances their attitude was rude and defensive, they made numerous excuses, in the end just gave up
- beach is a five minute walk through back alley ways, stopped numerous occasions by salesman and beggars 
- when you finally arrive at the beach, the hotel is suppose to have an exclusive area, separated by a rope, but staff ignore and let various sellers in, so not peaceful or excluded 

Positive - the waiters in the restaurant and Bob the entertainer were excellent.
"
"The worst experience I have had! The hotel is described as a 4* - however it is more like a 1* at its best. We arrived at 11am and the hotel was ready for us. The walk to the beach isn't as close as they had described it. You will need to walk through many dirty and scary alleyways to get to the beach. They have works going on at the hotel with very loud banging so they put us in a room at the back of the hotel - which to be fair we didn't get to hear much of the works. But then you hear the works going on from the balcony. The balcony doors would not close so as two young women we did not feel safe. Talking of safe - we were told we had to pay 25 euros per day just to use the safe which was a shock as I have not experienced that in other hotels before. The air conditioner wasn't working, so when we rung the reception they got very defensive. they sent the technician guy to come and have a look and he got rude to us and said he can't fix it. We then rung the reception and they told us there's not much they can do as it's down throughout the whole hotel and that when the manager comes in the evening they will keep us updated on IF it will work. The bed sheets were not clean, they had yellow stains and the cleanliness was not up to par with how I would expect a 4* to be. (I only ever stay in 4/5* hotels). At the end of the first day we decided to get ready for dinner and before we could have a shower, we noticed the shower head wasn't working and orange water was coming out. We asked the reception for the second time to move us to a different room and they refused. They said they will send the technician guy up again and that to keep the water running and the orange water will go. 1 hour later nobody had come up and checked the water for us so we rung up our travel agents - they saw the pictures and spoke to the hotel and they too felt the staff were very rude and THANK GOD they moved us to a 5* resort down the road which was much better. (Palais Des Roses) - this all happened on the first day, we did not have to even stay one night - so we got lucky there."
"Watch out for the guy who works at the pool bar who wears glasses, you go to get a drink and he would say pay me later or tomorrow, he doesn’t write it down on a paper so when you go to pay he says a higher price than what you owe. He pretends to be your friend and makes you buy drinks for him. He drink in the room behind the bar. The drinks at the bar inside are a different price than at the pool bar makes you consider that he is over charging people. 
Pool is okay the towel person is friendly especially when you talk to him as he always smiles. 
Security with red hair is lovely too. 
Breakfast wasn’t great as most of it use to be empty and they didn’t too it up after 9am so you will need to get their earlier.
People selling tours are so pushy and get annoyed if you do not purchase with them
We went on city tour the driver took us to few places and we tipped him but he wanted more and got really aggressive which made us not want to do the other tour we had booked. 
Not far from the beach so in good location and food places nearby."
"Booked for a pool view was very noisy due to work men banging and disc cutting till 2/3am in the morning ,food very poor,breakfast little choice very very bad ,no entertainment through the 10 days was there as the program said ,ready to come home after 3 days. Would not give this hotel 1 star."
"We went there as a family and to be honest the room was awful, dirty, there was a strong smell of mood and the hotel sheets where yellow and they never changed them since we were there, the toilet was dirty and not keep well the towel where gray and it was plenty of mod I wanted to cry since we stayed there for 7 days. the gym wasn't even a gym all the machines weren't working like the wifi. OH but let's talk about the wifi, the hotel clearly advertised the wifi in his website but when we went there the wifi wasn't working i asked the receptionist why the wifi wasn't working he told me they will fix the next day but guess what ? they never fixed!
the Breakfast was disgusting omg the milk expired like the butter and marmalades. for breakfast, they had rice cucumber and scrambled eggs. The orange juice wasn't an orange juice but was an antibiotic.
 they advert this hotel as a 4-star hotel, but I don't give them even a 1 star, to be honest, the only good thing about this hotel was the friendly staff.
Me and my family we will never go in that vampire hotel never again we are so disgusted."
"Shown to our room with a pool view,to be woken the following morning by renovations of the pool area.pneumatic drills,squeaky wheelbarrows and numerous workman worked 24 hours per day for the following five days.despite numerous requests to change hotels we had to come home five days early at our own expense.The only compensation offered were evening meals,which were buffet style(normally cold after 10 minutes) in a curtain drawn dining room so as you couldn't see the work being carried out"
"This hotel makes our holiday so andvetorous. The safe was blokking our passports and all of ours money. The renovation was starting our 3th day... it was terrible noisy. 

A part of the staff was kind and attentive. 

It is only 2 star hotel not a 4 star."
"This hotel probably deserves a 2 1/2 star rating but definitely not a 3 star.  The free breakfast was nice but was very bland (nothing special) and the overall service was ok again nothing special.  It was a maze to find my room (no help from the staff), and the room had a dark and dreary feeling to it (no overhead light in the bedroom).  You can definitely do better in this city, and I would recommend looking for a better place.. The only good thing is that it is a very short drive to Agadir Marina Harbor (see photo); otherwise look elsewhere."
"Recently returned to the Argana  Hotel after having spent many a pleasant stay there nine years ago. What a shock we got on arrival! The place had really gone downhill and was dark, shabby and quite dirty in many parts of the hotel. 
Nobody seemed to be in charge and staff numbers had been hugely reduced....on the Friday of our stay there was nobody working at the pool and no chef working at the snack bar....when I requested assistance with lifting out a parasol  at reception, I was treated extremely rudely by the female staff member...quite unbelievable!!!
Staff in general, were very unpleasant (unlike previous years when they were lovely and extremely helpful) and were very reluctant to do their job. To be honest you couldn't blame them as they worked long shifts and no doubt received precious little pay.
Our 7 day stay there was actually stressful. The standard of food served both at breakfast and at the pool was simply awful...inedible in fact! To get a drink was an ordeal, generally there was no ice and if you were lucky enough to finally get some, it was generally given reluctantly. The bar in the hotel was depressing, dark, dreary and stinking of smoke.  What was fascinating was that just outside was a lovely terrace where with  some seating and tables , guests could relax and enjoy a drink looking out over the pool. 
The rooms were also very shabby and musty .  The daily cleaning generally comprised of a quick lick of a cloth and the sheets were not changed at all in the whole week!!!
Carpets and general decor in the entire hotel were grubby and smelly and the place always seemed dreary and VERY dark as the lighting was very very poor.
By the last day if our stay we couldn't wait to get out of the place and felt seriously let down by the entire experience. Needless to say we will never return there . 
Finally it is important to mention and thank those few staff members who were doing their best and were very nice indeed. These included a  tall young doorman, one male receptionist  and a lovely guy who helped us by the pool and who organised our taxi for us when we were leaving. "
"we travelled in 2017 .we found the facilies not as we expected in the reviews,on all levels we found everything to be shabby. we ended up having to take this up with holiday company. there was a long list of faults .we did go off season and still not good.alot of people complained "
"ROOM - The room was ok. But as a married couple you expect to have a double bed. We however had two single beds that we had to push together. 
The room itself was clean and tidy. We had trouble the last few day with the hot water, they did some maintenance work which ended up making the hot water come out a Brown/yellow color. Over all it was an ok room with a balcony view of the pool. 

Reception - Most of the staff at reception spoke English and were very friendly. However we did find that one of supervisors of the reception not too be so friendly and quite rude. Also when we simple asked for a plate and cutlery (which we didn’t think was too much) to take up to our room, we were simply told NO. 

FOOD. Breakfast came with the price of the room but was very basic, bread, pastries, cooked breakfast (not a lot to choose from) and a small variety of fruit.. the only problem we had was on the last day when I can across a small fly in my Fruit salad. Other than that, I would again say it was just ok.. 
Lunch was 120dh per person per day. 
Dinner was 160dh person per day.

We ate out most days as we prefer to do that but if like us, you were there for 1 week or more, this could be a very expensive holiday. 

HOTEL - over all the hotel was ok. We didn’t spend much time there only when we came back of an evening too sleep. I don’t think we would return to this hotel any time soon. "
"We stayed here for feb half term.
The staff are very efficient and frindly, however the heating in the room was not working and there was a very bad smell coming out of it.
The bathroom was covered in mould and the mirror was painted so the could cover the rust.
To use the hotel Wifi, we had to go to reception as there would not be any signal in the room.
this did not really feel like a 4 star hotel."
"Just got back from agina in morroco the hotel was ok the room we put  in was very dark and smelt  the next day I asked for another room that room was brighter at night the room was cold but the heating didn't work so they gave us some blankets breakfast was poor if you want saleds that's fine but all you get is fried eggs all together the food was poor what I payed for for a four star is not what I got  i could go on but not anough room on my page the best place to eat is MAXWELLS just 5min in taxie  good food  from  Manchester"
"Let me start by saying that this hotel is definitely not a 4 stars, it's a 2 to 3 stars at it's best. The furniture is very old and needs refurbishment, very slow check in, some of the ladies in reception are very little informed about their hotel, mattresses are hard and not comfy, breakfast is very limited: no cheese, no fresh juices, no yoghurt, you'll have to queue for 15 minutes to get an omelette! They only put a tiny soap in the toilet, don't expect any shampoos or little bottles of shower gel that you can get in other respectable hotels. The worst thing was the mold which was over the bathroom's ceiling corners, as someone who's allergic to mold, these bathrooms could trigger my asthma. I booked two rooms and specified while booking that I want one with double bed and another one with two individual beds. I was given two rooms with individual beds and when spoke to them they asked me to come again the next day which is what I did, I was then given two other rooms which I rejected as they were not getting any sun, and weren't having a fridge or a phone. I was told to come back again in the afternoon and the guy in reception was utterly ridiculous! He was talking over me while I was calm and explaining my booking, he then said that the hotel doesn't guarantee that customers get the rooms that they've chosen online! I found it extremely unprofessional that he was very unapologetic about it and expected me to just sort myself out. Anyway, we've decided to keep the rooms but we're definitely not coming back again. Also there's no animation or play area for children, my son was excited to see the coloured area by the pool but it was closed 24/7 so an additional disappointment. Add to that that you're not allowed to bring in food or drink from outside, we were stopped by the security guy at the door for 2 bottles of juice! The only good thing about it is that it's close to some restaurants and the beach. Seriously, pay a bit more and stay somewhere else better where you can enjoy your trip to the beautiful Agadir. This hotel is not decent enough for travellers."
"Booked a package deal b & b on a budget, hotel rating states 4 star in my opinion it's a 2 star, breakfast is less than standard breads drink salad and if you want a omelette chef will make for you, in all honesty we skipped breakfast for the 5 days here and ate out. Hotel I assume is in line with Moroccan styling quite old fashioned and dated not the type of hotel I would choose to stay in again. On arrival told i would have to pay tax for my duration here 12.76DH PP on a whole rooms are cleaned daily not bad for what you pay. Tv in room is great but unfortunately no english speaking channels. Wi-Fi is available and free to use best signal is in the lobby you can get signal in rooms on the 4th floor but its tempremental. If you are not having your meals in the hotel directly across the road there are places to eat cafe pizza hut chicken and Indian, out the hotel and to the right on the left had side about a 3 min walk there's a MacDonald, out the hotel and left there are a row of convinence shops continue to the end of the road and turn left there are some local fast food eatery shops  (not bad we ate there quite a lot) based on 2 adults eating at local food shops 85DH (£7) if you continue along this stretch of road cross the road walk down some stairs you will find more food shops walk a bit further and to the right continue straight on the right hand side and left hand side you can find decent food we had the best pizza and spat bowl cost no more than 150DH including soft drinks for both."
"Well what can I say x Booked this hotel on the reviews and the so called kids club and kids pool advertised.  We have just returned October Half term quite a few kids there but no entertainment for them - the old people moaned if the kids made a splash jumping in the pool and the so called kids pool was closed.  Nightime it was like a mortuary with nothing to do so went to bed.  Breakfast is great if you are happy to eat bread and olives. Hotel is old and dated and really needs a revamp,  The staff try there best but really they a fighting a loosing battle."
"The location of the hotel is lets say acceptable. That was with the positives for Argana.
As a traveler i have only two demands to the hotels-sleeping quality and decent breakfast. Unfortunately this hotel cannot provide this to the clients. We have had room in 4th floor with view to the ocean and the second room was on the first floor with view to the pool. In the first room the noise from the club next to the hotel was until 4 am - absolutely not acceptable.In the second room the noise from the internal bar with karaoke and live singers was until 2 am. The breakfast was just bad. I cannot understand how is it possible to have mostly Europeans clients and to offer breakfast like this.Lack of variety of cheese, cold cuts, yogurts, serials, bakery, vegetables, even boiled eggs ware not offered. On some days the finished items ware not replaced and the only available food at 9 am was baked tomatoes, cooked rice, tomatoes, cucumbers and one kind of salami. The dinner was a bit better but still nothing special.  And the other annoying issue - smoking is allowed almost everywhere in the hotel - at the reception, lobby bar, pool, rooms, corridors. Sorry but with al this issues i cannot  recommend this hotel."
"Firstly , I have written several reviews on this property , I've always been fair as I am 17 years coming to this hotel , there have been occasions when things were not perfect but they always got sorted out and I loved the location of the hotel. Sadly things change , staff mainly that I had commented on that were great in the past including the reception staff , now sadly all the good ones have left and had been replaced by dreadful reception staff, in fact they look 3 teenagers who have been grounded for been bad.  I've just returned from 10 days here booked via Alpharooms as the tour operator I normally travel with Sunway are not operating there for the summer - but I believe are back for the winter. Alpharooms had a deal on half board which wasn't the cheapest but as it was August and I had to travel I didn't have any choice , no issue with Alpharooms - booked on-line - voucher was downloaded etc. Checked in to room 4225 found the wifi ( and I needed it ) was not working - reception told me straight to my face that it was my device was the problem, next day I found several French people had been told the same thing,  I have someone close to me who's in hospital in Ireland and I had given the hotel contact number , when I called the hospital I was informed they had tried to contact me 3 times that morning , 2 times been put rooms where they said a woman with a French accent answered the 3rd they said no-one by my name staying there, the I had a call from a friend who lives in Agagir and who is Moroccan ( so no language issues) was told 2 times I wasn't in my room - I went to reception and the young male receptionist shrugged his shoulders and said no idea and walked away. I was the informed I could change my room to 2119 as it had better wifi coverage , I did this... transfered everything and then to discover the air conditioning wasn't working , this is Thursday 17th of August - the Air-conditioning got fixed on Tuesday the 22nd ( I kept been told every time I checked ""man is coming"" it was on average 42 degrees, I then informed on the 17th of August my contacts in Ireland the new room number and just to test things out I called the reception from my mobile changing my voice and again I was put through to another room I think it was an Arabic man answered and tried again to be told that there was no answer from the room , reception continued to deny they had recieved any calls. The wifi still wasn't  working and I was still been told no-one else has a problem , until then I noticed the cafe ""Argana OPain"" was full all the time ( this establishment was normally empty) and I realised everyone was using smart phones or tablets , one Arabic gentleman said he was so sick of been told ""no wifi issues"" and then discovered that the wifi in the cafe worked perfectly , reception still looked at me and said ""it's not our problem, it's yours"" 
Then on Friday the 18th I went to get money out of my safe to find there was no way of opening the door - I was told by reception that there had been a few technical issues , and where was my receipt for the safe ? When I replied it was in the safe with the other documents I was told ""oh that's a problem"" the man is away for the weekend - the safe got fixed on Tuesday 22nd , luckily I had my wallet and was able to get money out on my debit card. 
The hotel was full , the sunbeds had towels on them from 6am , you could not get near the pool area - granted it was August no-one can do anything about that except this time the Argana staff seemed relectant to help anyone. As outlined I was on half board this time , I got wise after the first 2 mornings as I can down about 8.45/9am and there was nothing left - unusually  this is one of the few hotels in Agadir who seems to start shutting down the breakfast service at 09.15 as the other hotels go on until 10am - I started having breakfast early there were no issues, the same very good staff were there as always however they also commented on the poor reception staff that everyone seems to be complaining about , the evening Buffett could be ""photocopied""  same food, same position every evening , I eat there 4 times of the 10 days as it was tasteless and bland 
On Thursday the 24th I went to get my passport and money from the safe as I was leaving the next morning to find ..yet again .. Safe had electrical failure, went to reception and they called and I was told ""the man is with his family at home , he will try to come down"" ... I explained there was no ""try"" in this situation , I was leaving and I wanted to access my documents and money and that was it , at the same time there was a Polish woman having the same issues  with her safe, this was at 21.15 - the man came at midnight ( 2 of them) and took the door off the safe and then asked me for 50dhs (€5) each for their taxi fare - I threw them a 50dhs and told them to go. 
The best is yet to come .... On checking out the sulky young female receptionist told me I owed her for 3 days of the safe as I only initially had booked it for a week , so I pointed out what about  the 3 days it was locked and could not be opened , She then slapped her hand down fully on the marble counter and said ""pay or I'll get the police"" I demanded to see Mr. Jamal the senior receptionist , at first he refused to come out and then when he came out and I pointed out on 2 different  occasions that the technical guy had demanded 50dhs from me , he said very quietly ""that should not have happened"" and said we will forget about so ..... Hang on ....why should I forget about it? I also pointed out to Jamal that he should send he 3 receptionists back to the hotel school as in particular the females were the worst I'd come across in any establishment ,  It was the Argana Hotels obniouxs staff that made my holiday miserable .... I had requested on 3 occasions to speak to Hicham who I believe was the owners son to complain about this , each time I was told ""you missed him"" "" he's just gone"" only to discover on the last day from the dining-room staff that he had been in Tangier for a month.... So he had NEVER been around , so much for the Argana - not having a holiday rep is a big disadavange , I was genuinely upset leaving that morning as the hotel treated me like I was there in a free room as a favour , I wish Sunway the best of luck in the winter with this place .... I won't be back"
"The beds are so hard, and also bad since the soft underbed makes it all strange. I have only once slept on a worse bed in 100+ hotels.

We asked about the aircondition (not working) and they changed our room. Still not working. We asked in the reception 4 times, and they just said that a tecnician will come. Nothing happened so we called our tour company. Then a tecnician came within a few hours, but when we asked nothing happened for days.. But, the aircondition wasn't working after he ""fixed"" it either. This is kind of a theme of the hotel. It's getting old and need renovation, but nothing is happening.

Apart from theese 2 things it's a good place. Good location, friendly staff, good food.

Some smaller bad things are the gym and that they insist that you buy water and things there for like 2 Euro a bottle. No food/water allowed to take into the hotel from outside.

In all it's not that bad if you can handle the really hard beds and don't need aircondition."
"The high point for this hotel is the lobby, the first thing you see. It is quite simply majestic with a wide space opening up towards the ceiling four stories above, enabling a view of the hall ways. Unfortunately, it is all downhill from there. We had to fight with the front desk to get a room with a single, queen-sized bed; they kept wanting to put us in one with twin beds. We got to the room and discover that the air conditioning didn't work, only the fan which recycled stale air. We ultimately turned it off because of the smell. We pointed this on to the front desk, who promised to check it out personally along with a technician. Two hours later, no news, so I went back and was told that a technician would be called to look into matters. Another two hours go by, still no air conditioning, so I went back and this time was offered a room change, but didn't take because of the late hour. Eventually, we found out that the front desk never had any intention of calling a technician (we only found this out because we were with a group). The real problem was that the hotel did not want to turn it on, preferring that its customers suffer rather than spending a few extra bucks. 

The wait staff in the restaurant were about as rude as they come. When I sat down at a table, the Maitre D barked at me, ordering me to move because that table had been reserved for a soccer team. Well, excuse me, but next put a reserved sign on the table and find a more polite way of asking me to move. This turned out not to be an isolated event. A day later at breakfast, I asked for spoons. The waiter huffed off and when he cam back, he literally threw the spoons on the table. Another time I asked for an ice bucket for our wine. The waiter sighed, threw the corkscrew on the table and stomped off to get one. I could go on, but I think you get picture. One of the wort hotel experiences I have ever had."
"First of all, the staff never gave us the correct rooms that we asked for. Secondly, they never arrived on time with anything that we ordered from them at all ever, be it food, drink, new towels, any hotel services from them of any kind, anything. No efficiency from them and nothing but dirt-poor treatment at every single solitary turn from the staff to the customer in everything, always. Third, they were the most rudest and most horrible people in the world to us about everything and for this reason among so many others which I will not mention and those of which only they are to blame for, I would not ever recommend this hotel to anyone. Not at all, not ever."
"I've stayed at the Argana perhaps seven or eight times in the past 20 years. It's decline has been steady - more obvious in the past 8 years or so. This time booked on internet, was led up the back stairs, then through a corridor to a waiting area and through another corridor to my room with a view. A view ......... a view that resembled a wasteland. The room (and the preceding walk) smelled of mold/damp.I didn't complain .......... just went with it!
Looking up holidays tonight - thinking of hitting Agadir in November and was truly amazed that people were talking this place up."
"For the first time ever I can't find the right words to say about a hotel, it's perhaps true that some countries tend to use tourism for a primary source of income but to use a 'cabaret' as a brothel is beyond me.
This is NOT a four star hotel, I think it's very dishonest to insist upon calling it as such when people have noted it's simply an upper tier 2 stars hotel, never even a three star.
The swimming pool is disasterous, I saw a child pooing and told the reception who simply ignored me just to ruin the whole day for everybody.
Food is alright but if given! they are treating customers like beggars in there!

In a few words, just don't go there, find something better and not too far in price heft."
"I have checked what people are saying about this hotel and i still trying to find those 4*. Unfortunately the rooms are not like on the pictures , we had just breakfast and i am really pleased because of that cause we had just eggs, olives ,butter and jam for 10 days . Internet it s just on the lobby area ,just one girl from reception speak english thanks god . People trying to be more than kind with u just because they wait for tips . Really bad hotel , really disappointed.  "
"Pictures are really tricky :)  the room don't look like 4* room should look. Breakfast what can I say!?  If u want to eat for breakfast for all holiday just egs, jam, butter and olives that's the hotel u are looking for. Very disappointed!!!"
"the hotel from outside look nice   inside very dated hotel  the restaurant manager very arrogant. at  9.30 am  he decided  no more omelettes  BREAKFAST FINISH  10.00am mister the restaurant manager . your giving a bad exemple to your staff"
"Don't stay at this hotel this is from a positive person!!for you own Health and safety!! We came for 3 nights girls holiday birthday break what a load of crap first day we got scammed from a random fake worker who took our money and never booked Any excursions yet the Hotel let him come into the Hotel and scam it's guests!! Never been so disgusted I will upload a picture of him!! Secondly why did no one tell us they have the most creepy scary beggars outside the hotel no wonder the have security didn't feel safe at all this man chased us to our Hotel had to pay a take out worker to walk us home and when we did get to our hotel we had you use our iphone torch as the hotel turn off ALL there lights so you can't not see anything!! honestly it's pitch black so if you do go take a torch hopefully you don't fall down the never ending stairs They have creepy manikins with creepy picture frames through our hotel .. We got stuck in the lift for 30mins we had no idea what was happening so scared my friend had asthma she didn't have her inhaler so she started to loose it oh we was in the dark too  after that no apology nothing like it was normal oh the cleaning staff didn't clean our room after we waited for aaaages and took forever with toilet tissue cold water also ...I'm sure I'm forgetting a few things but apart from that the beach was amazing clear sand with clear water met some lovely people long walks on the beach is a must!! Hotel has free loungers which is okay hard finding it mind have to go camel riding take a scarf gets chilly in evening haggle don't get scammed we paid £35.00 for camel riding city tour and spa while others paid £30.00  each I would deffo go back only for the beach do more excursions don't book through hotel you don't have to do anything you don't want to just say NO and walk the duck away if you do find it hard to get away from any locals trying to sell just say last few hours going home or like we did while walking off noThankyou noThankyou no Thankyou noThankyou  and walk off really fast my advise don't book Hotel especially for family and friends boring hotel more for old people maybe that's why they turn the lights off and have mushy breakfast :/  if you do want to enjoy. Night out go to naya lounge good music and entertainment good for a laugh shisha too next to English pub "
"Hotel is in fairly good location, close to the centre with many restaurants, a bit too far to the ocean and You have to go through dodgy streets full of beggars. The hotel is dirty in general, entertainment is in main hotel lobby...smoking is allowed in the lounge so couldn't even see through the smoke in there. Prices too high for the standard of the hotel and the food was extremely poor. Had to eat croissants with jam every morning. Even the tea and coffee were horrible."
"This hotel is very dated & run down no kettle in rooms they also don't allow outside beverages bought outside to be brought inside we're currently here and have actually bougt a kettle the hotel staff are rude ,oh and do not order room service as it doesn't arrive the crockery is cracked and chipped dirty coffee cups overall very bad worst hotel ever wouldn't recommend to my worst enemy the waiting staff very inexperienced & impersonal on arrival witnessed a dish returned be put back out to be RE-SERVED disgusting food here very poor if not bad"
"We arrived to hotel Saturday and i fell sick on Sunday morning with my back was very sore. Since 5 am himself was going up and down to reception all night and the attitude from reception was awfull he asked receptionist and the manager if doctor could be called reply was... BRING TO HOSPITAL NO DOCTOR he asked where and reply...GET TAXI OUTSIDE no satisfaction and pretended not to understand you ....
Himself had to carry me to taxi off we went to hospital ...on return i stayed in bed for week as back was very sore ..himself had to give me medicine asked at bar for spoon bar man replied bring it back rudely ..himself went to bar for a few drinks in hotel argana  during holiday no change back when you  buy a drink himself was talking to other irish during the holiday and the same was happening you had to ask for change back and watch your change restaurant had buffay for dinner , dinners cold and food is not nice. Restaurant staff are nice but wouldnt let a couple bring in a bottle of water took it off them ..on the saturday we were flying home a week early to go to hospital in ireland... phone in the room rang at 12pm to tell us to get out of room even tough we had paid for 2 weeks or pay extra money if you want to stay few hours extra as we were waiting for taxi to pick us up at 5pm even doe hotel had knowing that my back was sore. We been told...Sunway had taking it off us as ye not staying with us the second week. The Sunway rep Layla wasnt even concerned how we were just told us ye will get no money back from Sunway. I strongly would not recommend this hotel i hope no one is in our position to fall sick they dont care about you in this hotel all they want is your money. And you have to hide bottle of water if you want to bring one to hotel from outside. DO NOT STAY THERE KEEP AWAY"
"My self and my wife decided to spend our honey moon in Morocco. I have been here before a few years go and really enjoyed it. We booked the Argana hotel which is apparently 4star but don't get me started on that it'll just get me wound up even more. On our last day I was in the pool and my wife was sleeping in the hotel room. All of a sudden my wife gets a call from reception and was spoken to very rudely by an old gentleman who claims to be the manager. She was then told to leave the room quickly as apparently we were supposed to have checked out by 11am this is now 2pm. I was furious and I advised this ""so called manager"" that we were not advised of this when we first arrived nor were we told during or nearing our stay. This individual then advised that if we wanted to stay closer to our flight then we would need to pay 300dirhms roughly £20 I refused to pay this and again Stated  we were never advised of this. I angrily went to our room got dressed ridiculously quickly and packed came downstairs to the reception area and gave him the keys. To add insult to injury he then asked for ""city tax"" which I don't really understand this was 247 dirhams roughly £16

In conclusion Please avoid leaving late on your last day and if you looking for great customer service AVOID THIS HOTEL AT ALL COST
The photo attached is the culprit so called manager who literally thrown us out of our room. Please take a good look and remember his face he is the old man with reading glasses."
"People actually come and stay in this ""hotel "" and say oooo nice,whatttt two weeks that I'm here and I still have to see the ""nice part""
Reception service very very low man they don't give a damn about your opinion you speak  with them they say ok ok no problem but in the end you start from the beginning,useless etc.... 
Restaurant: what a sadness,in two weeks I never had the chance to eat some decent food,you must order the drinks a day before so this way you have it on time,breakfast never changed the same every day."
"Hotel itself is not bad but the restaurant and bar staff are begging on a consistent basis. There is security on the restaurant encase you take an apple or an orange away with you. You cant get boiling water in the restaurant to make a cup of tea even though you ask for boiled water you get tepid water. The breakfast is continental but, the coffee is cold tastes horrible as if it was there from the night before. The entertainment is non-existent. No pool entertainment either very disappointing hotel.
Will never go back there"
"Rooms are dated. 
Bathrooms were mouldy 
Sockets in room not working 
Lights in bathroom faulty and not working 
Beds very uncomfortable 
Some staff unhelpful 
Had to change rooms because bathroom unhygienic and could not shower there. 
Had to pay to be upgraded due to substandard facilities. 
Some hotel staff joining force with taxi drivers to over charge us for fares into the city centre. 
In all not a pleasant experience staying at this hotel. 
The breakfast had poor selection. Glasses were dirty. Bits of dirt floating in hot water for tea. 
Glad only stayed there for 3 nights and couldn't wait to get out of there.
The only positive is the swimming pool although the water was too cold and so I didn't get to swim in it. 
"
"Our first stay in Agadir was very nearly out last as we ended up staying here for 3 miserable weeks. Food inedible most nights, intimidated by minder on the door who inspected your bags for forbidden food or drink brought into the hotel and confiscated if he found any (including drinking water!). Signs everywhere: don't do this, don't do that. Lighting in public areas turned off at night so don't think of venturing downstairs before 7.00 if you don't want to break your neck. Waiters bumping up the price of wine if you make the mistake of paying cash & not signing for it. The interior reminds one of The Munsters without the humour. The only positive thing I can say is that our room, although one of the unfurnished variety with running brown water, was very clean and we had a lovely old maid who looked after us."
"On our recent trip to Morocco in April we stayed for 2 weeks in The Argana Hotel in Agadir.  We were disappointed the standard had gone down since we stayed 4 years ago.  Restaurant Staff Reception Staff Porters, Housekeeping Staff were very friendly.  The change of direction by Management with outdoor activities including loud music some nights late at night.  The noise effected rooms which overlooked the Pool & Gardens.  This was our 4th time staying in this hotel."
"Hardly any positives only ones are is that it's five minutes away from the beach and five minutes away from maccies but apart from that the hotel is a joke we payed for two a room (12of U.S.) we ended up getting 3 people to a room blanket which made me Ill smelly room they moved as away from in the end (halfway through our holiday) I took some water into the restaurant got billed the waiter was rude treat us like dirt! The massage parlour don't go there if you're a married man as I found out what happens down there the hard way half the time you can't exchange money and the safes where not very safe  awful. "
"The trips out were ok but there are always some additional costs, make sure you know whats in or out, they always give half the story
lf you need the room for a couple of hours at the end of your stay  then expect to pay top dollar
The the main problem is honesty- we asked for a safe in the room for valuables the cost 150D , we gave 200D but was told they had no change, the lady took 100D and said call back and pay 50D later, on check out she said we had paid nothing and owed 150D, nice little scam she keeps 100D and then demands full payment again.
She was adement in front of all that she was not allowed to take part payment, the bottom line dont trust unless its written down, the amont was not the problem but its par for the course at this hotel, always a problem with change so pushing to round up the cost as a tip.
In the bar in the evening the change was different on every round, they tip themselves on nationality being served. 
The bottom line is you are a target and if they can get away with it they will"
"Arrived to Argana on sat evening at around9.15,even though plane was early ques in immigration were horrendous as clashed with arrival from Uk.Checked in to Argana dropped bags went to hotel restruant to find it was a buffet not ala carte and it was closing.Food was not very plentiful and courses scarce thus my partner only had bread roll as she did not like anything in buffet I had burgers and salad as was hungry tired and looked best of bad food choice.In fairness it was ok.asked for bill and received shock as my partner was charged full buffet price  for solitary bread roll.policy seemed to be ""enter and pay"" she contested with reception and after  1 hour hotel relented.we felt under pressure whilst eating as staff hovered around us waiting to finish up. Had to complain to reception on 3 nights in a row due to noise and fighting in bar and pool area,told it was outsiders smoking in shisha tents adjacent to pool.Argana reception is open plan therefore every sound reflects all over foyer and could be heard plain as day.In fairness jamillia on reception moved us to much better and quieter room She was outstanding all through our stay.Lots of other guest made complaints re noise from bar every night seemed to be non guests/locals there till 2/3am??. Breakfast was boring same food for 7 days Abdul the waiter was very courteous but they wanted people to sit almost on top of each other which isn't nice. We had been at Argana 10 yrs ago  and hotel seemed to be drap and in need of brightening  up.it was clean maids did great job every day except towels  were hard and smelly need to be replaced  and change from white!Rooms were kept very well.Hotel next door was derlict and not very nice to look at.pool area was nice towels  available for 10 £deposit thought this was crazy and couldn't be charged to room.Overall was dissapointed with hotel except for coffe and cake shop outside  hotel def 10/10 part of hotel but different world modern clean and great staff. In general Agadir has become very shabby and dirty over past 10 years and def won't be returning again.tommy and Tisha cork"
"If I could give this a zero star review then I would. This was honestly the worst holiday and hotel of my life. We arrived with our booking number and emails and despite this, the hotel still claimed they had no record of us. They offered ho help or assistance or apologies for what was clearly their mistake. After finally convincing them that we had no way or calling or emailing anyone, they let us borrow their hotel phone to ring our travel agents. After waiting for hours we went for a walk and then told the reception staff we would be waiting in the lounge for when our booking was confirmed. After sitting right in front of the reception for a while we finally went up and asked ourselves if they had heard anything. The extremely rude woman said yes, its sorted and then thrust some keys at us. No apologies or explanations and this set the tone for the whole week. Going to our room it was dirty, dated, the lamps fell off the wall, the telephone dropped to pieces, the fridge did not work, the aircon did not work and the safe did not work. Despite us telling them of all things they only managed to send someone up to look at our safe after we had complained many times. It would appear that no one gets anything done first time despite it being promised to be done
. We were manhandled trying to get walk into the hotel with a small bottle of water and told this was not allowed. A day later we saw a group of young arab men walking in with mcdonalds takeaways and the doormen merely gave them a wink and a wave?! The hotel denies racism being prevalent but looking at many reviews this just isnt the case. Another day we got a phonecall to our room telling us we were leaving today and to get out. When I explained we werent due to leave til the end of the week I got hung up on! The food and dining was awful. For breakfast you had a giant table full of different types of stale pastries and cakes. The juice was the only place we saw that served a processed ""mixed tropical juice"". Everywhere else was lovely fresh juices with actually fruit. The service and food in the pool bar wasnt any better. 
The most serious incident of our trip was an injury my partner sustained in the pool. What I imagine is a suction hole or jet about the size of a grapefruit is uncovered and whilst leaning on the side of the pool to talk to me he was violently sucked in on his stomach. He had to force his skin from the hole and despite making a fuss and alerting staff nearby nothing was done. They ignored him and walked away. This is a serious safety issue! if it was a small child swimming underwater it could be fatal. Instead he was left with a serious injury to him, resulting in red marks and pain which had to be checked out by a doctor when we returned.
The argana seems to pride itself on the fact that is so generously ""allowed the guest to move to another room"" as though this is some kind of good service on their part! All this means is the majority of their rooms are trash that no one wants to stay in. The shower was ridiculous and we had one toilet roll to last all week. Despite ringing up 3 times and being promised some more was coming, surprise surprise, it didnt! Our holiday ended as it began with the extremely rude bald man on reception trying to overcharge us for some phone calls that we had made at the start (due to their inability to know who is staying where and when in their hotel!). When we questioned these charges he merely told us we should just pay anyway as its nothing to us!! I am not going to just give money away just because I am English, especially not to this sort of establishment. When we handed over some change for the correct phone calls he shouted at us and threw our coins all over telling us to forget it!
We walked out to the sound of another guest complaining over their room and charges...
What is even worse than the terrible stay is the awful petty attitude of the hotel after. We put a complaint in writing to both our booking agent and the Argana. The first apologised profusely and sent us a large food and flower hamper. The Argana on the other hand totally ignored us. Our booking agent also chased them up and they stopped replying to their emails. I also contacted the Aragana by email when they stop replying as soon as they realise who we are.  We were informed that they had 6 months to conduct an investigation due to the serious health and safety breaches. Well that time has come and gone and they still haven't said a word. All we wanted was an apology and someone to check the pool. Maybe they can explain here why they have ignored repeated attempts by both ourselves and our agent to speak to them.
Worst holiday ever."
"took my wife for her birthday, when we got to the hotel they gave us the worst room ever imaginable with single beds(thought them days were gone) they said all the rooms were booked and that we'll be getting another the next day, next day the room given was better but while settling in thought I'd run a bath.... The bath water was yellow, it was disgusting, had to now become strict, went to reception, through a tantrum and said to speak to manager, next thing we were upgraded to a junior suite room, after that I had no complaints, it was worth the small sum I paid for this holiday and hotel"
"We and another couple arrived after an excellent four day experience in Marrakech and were put into two appalling first floor rooms 129 and 130.  This was the exact opposite of what we requested and we had confirmed our request a few days before which, obviously, no one had read.  This may have been because we are English and not French.  The stink and dampness was unbelievable. We went back to reception to complain and it was obvious that they were expecting this.  We were told we could change rooms the next day which we did.  Reception gave us a card key to open our new room which they must have known would not work!  So we went up to the fourth floor and obviously couldn't open the room and thus had to go back to reception who told us that we had to find the maid who had the only key to the room!!  Eventually we found the maid who was the only person in the building who was helpful and she did indeed give us the key.  This room had four things wrong with it....
1 the curtain was ripped and didn't hang properly
2 the loo seat was broken, the wrong size (too small) and if you sat on it you went 45 degrees to the left
3 the hair dryer was broken
4 the worst thing was there was only one key in the whole building which would unlock our door which meant that the maid had to have it back and if we were going out we either had to find her and give it to her and then find her and get it back later.  This made it incredibly inconvenient.

Basil Fawlty (John Cleese) would have been proud of this reception.

The breakfast was the same every day and poor.  We could order boiled eggs, they may or may not come, but you never ever got an egg cup which maybe that had to be ordered separately and if two of you ordered egg cups you invariably only got one between you!  The dining room staff were on the whole miserable and favoured the French.

There were a few good points amid this disaster of the hotel.  The weather was good and the pool was excellent.  The man in charge of the sun beds etc was very helpful.  However, the whole ambience was spoilt by the appalling choice of loud music.

My wife is totally appalled I gave this two stars, she would say avoid at all costs."
"We came back from this hotel at the end of August and can only describe the experience more than disappointing. We came to Hotel Arcana after it being recommended by friends of the family and can't express how wrong they were about their feedback. 

Upon arrival to the hotel, we found the rooms outdated, dirty and small. We have two children, one was barely 6 months and finding brown marks on bath towels and human hair on the floor is completely unacceptable as these basic standards should have been addressed. We also didn't get a family room that we paid for, so extra furniture had to be brought into the room which made it quite crammed. We were told that our room would be cleaned for the night and would be able to move rooms the following day. We had more family staying in the hotel that night and sadly they too were incredibly dissatisfied with their room and we're also told that they would be moved the next day. 

Upon moving to another room, we found it to be a little better although level of cleanliness was still an issue, with black marks at the bottom of the toilet and the shower head so thick with mould we were worried if the water that came out would be clean or not! The bath tub had brown marks on our whole stay which begged the question when they were last properly cleaned, this meant that we all had to shower in flip flops including our 4 year old! 

The furniture in the room was all scratched and outdated. The light fittings moved if and hung upside down if accidentally knocked which from a point of health and safety was unsafe for the room to even be called a 'family room'! 

After moving to another room, a few days after, we were forced to move again after a French family were incredibly insulted by a 'crying baby' at 7.30am and took it upon themselves to bang on the adjoining door as well as approach our room to shout and swear at us! The reception staff were not supportive in this situation so we were moved yet again! Disgraceful! After being reassured that security would be sent up, I was astonished by the fact that no one came up despite the fact of waiting in the room for 4 hours in the room and wasting the day for my children! Upon ringing reception I wad told that it would be unfair to ask the French people to move as they may have come after us and that my family of 4 had to move once again!! The staff didn't seem to care and I was told to move room or give the key back!

Another issue for me was the hotel photographer who seemed to think it was ok to go round and take photos of little girls in their swimsuits without the permission of their parents!! When confronted he took offense and swore in French which he thought I didn't understand even though I previously asked him not to take the photos without my permission. We understood that he sold the prints but the way he took it was completely out of order!! The staff laughed it off as they saw me confront the guy! another point of unbelievably bad service!
 
The only positive things about the hotel, were the entertainment staff who were great with the kids and organised some nice evenings. Their spa also had nice treatments.

Agadir itself is not a clean place and definitely not recommended for younger children.

Hotel definitely not recommended. We had the experience from hell and most definitely won't be returning!!!"
"To put it plainly, I have never experienced such a poor level of Customer Service from a hotel in my life.  My advice to anyone going is to be your own concierge. Prepare everything in advance. Do not rely on the hotel for any support whatsoever.

The general vibe from the Reception/management staff is that:
a) You are putting them out by asking them something really basic.
b) They do speak English, but the communication barrier is cemented in their stinky attitudes.
c) They hate you (it turned into a hilarious joke between me and my boyfriend “oh haha I wonder how they will offend us today etc” or “No way, I’m too scared to ask them to change up my Sterling, you do it.”)

After a 10 hour journey through the night, we arrived at the hotel and were barely acknowledged and definitely not greeted. We said 'Salaam' to the receptionist and she looked at as if we had just offered her a poo sandwich.
Tax money was taken and forms were thrust upon us (NB bring your own pens - they won’t lend you theirs.) 

There was no introduction to the hotel, we were not told breakfast times, about facilities nor the fact that pool towels are only available morning OR after 3pm. (We cutely wasted 3 1/2 hours on our first full day waiting around for towels so we could go to the beach.) 
In the months leading up to the holiday, I emailed the hotel twice requesting a high floor room, with a double bed. I received no reply. After a 2 hour wait, we were given a room on the 1st floor, over-looking a wall of a derelict hotel, the room was coated in a thick layer of dust and the air con wofted out the smell of a dead owl.

I understand that room requests cannot always catered to, but we couldn’t stay in that room, so returned to Reception and asked to change rooms. I produced my printed emails and received blank looks, as if we had returned with double our previous poo sandwich offering. No apology for the uninhabitable room nor the fact my emails had been ignored. 

They muttered something about coming back tomorrow. We did and ended up moving to a cleaner room which was higher up (with two single beds but beggars cannot be choosers etc.) 

A really nice touch was that when we were moved rooms the Porter kept up the standard of rudeness and kept hassling us to 'hurry up' whilst we were still packing. In the rush I left my poor perfume in the dead owl scented room. I realised this and told reception if I could get it back. The answer was no. I was told to 'speak to the maid who cleaned the room directly as she hadn't handed it in.'

Weirdly enough, I did not take up the fruitless task to search the hotel for a French speaking maid and accuse her of stealing my perfume. Call me old fashioned but I believe that should have been managements job.
I decided to count my losses but I was gutted that I no longer had perfume to mask the lingering eau de dead owl from the previous room.

I cannot fathom why you would be so spectacularly unhelpful to guests who have paid to stay at the hotel. Budget holiday or no budget holiday, we all deserve to be treated with basic respect.

GOOD STUFF ABOUT HOTEL/AGADIR
- Pool is nice/clean, Ahmed is a little ray of sunshine.
- Decor in Reception and surrounding nooks are wonderful. Be aware that all toilets in public areas of hotel did not have doors or were taped off during our stay. Really weird.
- Shisha tent area by the pool is lovely for a drink/shisha but DO NOT EAT here. 'Chicken' tagine resembling a withered, conjealed sparrow and solid frisbee of flat bread is not a great dish (go to Restaurant Daffy for an amazing tagine)
- Well located
- Agadir Beach 
- Souk El Had
- Do the Berber night, it’s really fun. 
- We enjoyed smuggling wine into our room for drinks on the balcony looking at the sun set – there are shops on the road opposite the hotel, behind the parade of restaurants. Much better wine than the hotel offers."
"I have a very bad experience with this hotel. Personal is arrogant and annoying especially the men at the front desk. First we were given a room with a view of another building who smelled and furniture and everything was terrible. After I applied for a change of room was good. Personal poolside restaurant ignored us and after 20 minutes I went to the bar and asked the operator. Food and drink was terrible. Hotel.at do not really recommend this hotel just build stage so there all day I hear drilling and everywhere workers .In the evening and night times  there is a disco and rooms are not soundproofed."
"Dont do it!
Air conditioning didnt work, awful customer service, no main light for the room the hotel owners son waited for us outside the hotel at night and kept trying to get us to go in his car to make party!!
Staff around the pool made us feel very uncomfortable (the men), food was cold when finally arrived. Hotel staff very unorganised didnt seem to know what was going on. And wifi didnt work in our room even in the restaurant it kept not working we booked this hotel as it ranked really well on trip advisor I never complain but I had to warn people!"
"Stayed at the Argana hotel for a week and am quite surprised that they are considered a four star hotel. On our immediate arrival at about 11pm we checked in quite smoothly and then enquired about room service as we had missed the dinner service and after 7 hours of travelling were hungry and tired. We were told that there was no room service available and were advised to eat at the nearby McDonald's so off we went, when we returned with our food we were told we could not bring in the food to the hotel despite the receptionist advising to eat there. In the end we were advised to hide it in our bags which we did.

My first impression of the room was disappointment, very old with cracked tiled floors but the worst thing was the lack of cleanliness under the sink in the bathroom was a huge pile of dust and dirt and it honestly looked like it hadn't been cleaned in years (I've uploaded a picture). The tv did not work, the safe did not work and there was no room service menu or contact numbers for hotel services. It took two days and several visits to reception to have everything fixed and even then the mini fridge did not keep anything cool. It took 3 days to receive a room service menu which was rudely removed when we ordered food by the waitress so we just gave up on that.

The dinner at the hotel was awful, stale salads, poorly cooked cous cous and cold mains with a lack of taste so we literally ate out every day despite being half board. A huge issue for us was also the fact that housekeeping is extremely hit or miss, our room was not cleaned for two days despite directly calling housekeeping 4 times in two days where they promised they would come but never showed up. Earlier in the week when they had been inclined to clean the room they removed several towels and did not replace them so we had no towels and they did not replace toilet roll so we were forced to buy our own which is unacceptable. It appears that if you don't tip you don't get even the most basic services.

I would definitely not recommend this hotel to anyone due to the quality of the rooms and services, it was a frequent occurrence to see other guests at the end of their tether complaining in reception but the staff are pretty useless about fixing problems unless of course you tip them."
"This hotel is surely not a 4 star hotel, nothing there is even a decent 3 stars rated.
Hotel becomes a nightmare at night at night when the bad stuff start to happen in the bar.

I have just returned from Argana hotel, it's a very disappointing experience.
The health and safety standards just don't exist, I now wonder, what if some accident happened to me? I have not had an experience with accidents, but what if?

There really is nobody to take responsibility if anything happens, no life guards, nobody with any medical experience, I am glad I am home without having slipped in the pool area, or fallen down the stairs or in the labyrinth one has to maneouver when walking to the room, if anything happened to me, I would have been left to rot!

When booking, you see, I try to get the cheapest deal, and sometimes I change travel agents just because of an extra tenner, so if I have to pay another FORTY pounds as local tax, I might as well change the whole company, and opt for a hired flat instead.

I took a half board booking and having seen the food there, now I wish I took it on a room only basis, as I simply have eaten out every single day from day 2 till the end, and I also noticed that on that particular day (national food day in the hotel) a lot of people who don't take well to Coscous, they demanded to eat western food, and were given westen food, but how do I know what other food they had? I just went and put some unknown food on my plate and sat down to eat it, only to find it's too spicy, too cold, inedible, and I just had to eat the greasy spods they had, and then saw others eating fish, chicken and other food. Could that be 'a la menu'?

I also was threatened I would have to pay extra if I wanted to eat in my room, so i gave up on the hotel food altogher.
On the ad pages they claim so many things that are simply nonexistent.
The air conditioning, (Agadir goes up to about 40C) is too loud, and ineffective.
The room mini fridge is good if you want to heat food up, not to make it cold.
wifi, non existent, unless you like to mingle with women doing what I don't wish to talk about
entertainment ... what?
bar .. serves very good cold water .. they called that beer.
room service ... you mean unchanged sheets in 7 days?
in the street, you get hassled day and night by people who sell everything, and ..."
"Disastrous hotel, keep well away
I and the family visited this hotel back in December 2013 and on that occasion I wrote a more than positive review,  the staff feel the same, the hotel remains the same, and yet,  I have never seen a hotel that had gone from top to rock bottom in such a quick time. 
I booked one room for myself,  the wife and a 4 years o old kid, and that's from August 31st  till September 10th and and a second room for my wife's family,  an adult and two kids,  one 11 and the other 12 years old in September from the 1st till the 9th. The first through Travelrepublic.co.uk and the second through Lowcostholidays.com.
Initially. This is not a 4 star hotel,  not even the people who shed a 10/10 rating would claim so,  nothing is 4 star about it,  not the room size,  the bedding quality,  or the 10's of other criteria that are altogether missing like toilet accessories,  service standard,  heated swimming pool, life guards (that's a health and safety problem), entertainment, restaurant standards,  etc..a 3 star rating is a bit optimistic. 
Anyway let me start by the most disastrous bits first. 
1- from 10 in the evening the hotel becomes a brothel,  with Morrocan prostitutes filing up the entrance and having a pass at anything of the male species,  with particular emphasis at men with grey hair, i couldsee women and their clients using the lifts. 
 I can almost feel sexually transmitted diseases floating in the air!I
 2- there are no life guards, first aid, medical doctors, or even provisions for accidents, Morrocan emergency services are known to arrive only about funeral time. 
3- foods are scarce, worse still, nothing decent, on many occasions you don't find what you really want. 
4- some food like boiled eggs and omelets are only available if you order them, not on offer
5- another day I decided to give breakfast a miss,  but my wife thought she could bring me my food to the room,  so she grabbed a few bits and took them with her,  their chef went mad and spoke to her like she was stealing from the hotel,  then said,  I will take it up,  we do delivery!  And then on the way up told her that they charge for this service,  that was part of the greed we suffered. 
6- one day we were surprised to find only one towel in the room and when asked for another m the cleaner said ""you have dirtied the towels,  admin told me to give you only one towel"" . How embarrassing!!
7 - there's a Morrocan hamam in the hotel,  with prices that are 150 to 200 times the prices paid in the common hamams.
8- it was extremely embarrassing when a prostitute wanted to be nice to our child, his mom snatched him, I was then left with the task of explaining it to the child,  right in front of the prostitute!
- once you step into the restaurant, an old man assesses whether you are a resident or not, then he passes you over to a couple of other men depending on where you end up sitting, who will watch your every move, so if you're brave enough to do a second visit to the bar, they eye you in a way that would make you lose appetite altogether. 
9- even though I tried so hard to look serious and not look at prostitutes,  my wife became  suspicious when I had to go to reception area to get WIFI to check email every now and then,  as although the hotel claims to provide Internet access,  that is only in the reception area and you don't see that in your room. 
10- even though both websites have told us nothing about local tax to be paid at the hotel,  we were forced to pay about £30 and £40 extras for taxes that are supposed to have already been paid, as you can see,  the numbers feel haphazard,  and unfair, as far as I can tell,  and from previous experience,  this tax applies only to foreigners.

In short this is a mediocre 3 stars hotel that may cost you, your life,  a limb,  your marriage, your face and if not all that,  then at least too much money, so stay well away."
"This was without doubt the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. I’m not sure where to start. But ill begin with the fact that we were given a filthy room which stank, a vile smell wreaked throughout the entire corridor and seemed to form from within our bathroom. The bathroom floor was sticky and dirty. The toilet had hairs all over the seat. The bed sheets were old and stained. My pregnant wife and I actually had to buy an air freshener from the local store to cover the smell. I had to argue for over 24hours with the staff to get a better room. As the pictures they show you on the internet do not reflect the actual status of the rooms. The staffs were not friendly at all and were rude to say the least. We had to ask for the rooms to be cleaned on a number of occasions and many times toilet paper was not even left for us to use – we again had to complain to get toilet roll!
The only good thing I can say about the hotel was the location and the fact they had activities such as pool and table tennis to entertain you. But they seemed to pay more attention to the outer aspects of the hotel and completely ignored the fact that the rooms where people slept and bathed were not fit for living in our eyes. I would honestly discourage anybody from booking here."
"Waste of money, aircon not working told reception they didn't want to know not allowed to bring your own drinks or fruit in they will take it off you staff inc security are rude and never smile got charged extra taxes at the end of the stay which was not mentioned room was really dirty on first day had to call cleaners to clean room would not recommend stay away unless you want to waste money"
"Still have 3 days left here and if you are looking for a nice relaxing holiday DO NOT STAY HERE.

Arrived and were shown to our suite, having emailed previously I was told that we have a nice view of the pool area, really?  There was basically no balcony just two chairs that sat on what can only be called the bar and rest area with no pool insight.
Asked to move and fair do's this was hassle free and we now have a nice terrace area with 2 sunbeds and a couple of chairs.  Now why this hotel has one star..

Noise, noise and more noise it's unbelievable.  
There is construction going on from 10am to 6pm everyday, and we are not talking about a bit of painting here and there(although this is happening in other areas) we are talking powertools!!

Jack hammering all afternoon so loud that it vibrates the adjioning rooms.  Drilling non stop so loud that you cannot think.  Hammers smashing down walls etc etc.  It's like staying next to a fully functional construction site. 

Don't bother complaining to reception as a few have done this and they just don't care.

Breakfast starts at 05:30 so there is banging all through the halls.  The cleaner's start at god knows what time and are moving furniture around above and below you.

When we leave in three days the worst part is we need to give them their tax money so an 17.65 dirums each per day of our stay

Do not stay here, you have been warned."
"The website is very misleading when it comes to the rooms. We were given a room with 2 double beds and it looked like a cheap motel room you would find in a seedy motel. Then they showed us another one with a double bed and it looked the same and did not over look anything but a tree. Then they showed us one in the far far end of the hotel where you could see the ocean but it was the part of the hotel that is under construction and all you could smell was paint fumes and hear hammering.They finally gave us a different room which overlooked the ocean and the pool and the room was ok but still very cheap looking. The front staff on the day shift seems to have no personality. The restraunt closes very early at night so we had to go elsewhere for dinner. The breakfast buffet was average with only 2 hot foods offered, eggs and english muffin and a bunch of patries and fruit. The outside area is pretty nice though."
"The worst ever hotel we ever came to came with my wife and my 1 year old son and the breakfast was poor very poor as for the service we have to fight to get knife and forks and nobody would approach us to give us a drink diner was no diffrent 1 word to explain crap, reception staff was very unfriendly and the bar staff near the swimming pool only wanted to serve there own moroccan friends and staff who are more important and gave no care or bother to anybody else waited nearly 2 hours for a cheese burger which they said would be 10mins for my wife which I had to go out at night and get samething the staff act like the guest are an inconvenience and not once did the bar staff apologise or care just sat watching tv the front reception was taking the piss by talking in french to english guests and the stafg laugh with them, the staff are RUDE very rude and act like they are kings, dry cleaning costs £70 just to wash 8 items water in the bathroom coming out yellow which isnt right fridge is actually a freezer, ac only works 1 meter bathroom filthy the maid were the only people happy and friendly please avoid I wouldnt normally write a review but I stayed in about 50 hotels around the world and I wouldnt even rate this hotel agadir was brilliant hotel argana was terrible other english guests complained they ordered tea which never came and I watched a man who is a hotels friend abuse and embaress a tourist for being with a girl and wanted to fight him please please avoid I promise you will regret want to come home only cause of hotel this is not a 4 star it's a lie."
"I will start by saying that my review of the Argana is my first review on TA. My experience was such that I signed up in order to share my feelings.

My girlfriend and I arrived at the hotel with high hopes of a lovely week in Morocco. As we approach reception, there is little in the way of smiles. We hand over our booking confirmation only to be told that it does not exist. They did little to help, other than offer us the use of their phone to call the agent, after which the receptionist turned and said ""Its no problem, we charge to your room"". My response of ""We don't even have a room"" was greeted by a confused smile. Whilst the agent tries to fix things, we decide to grab some food and order a pizza. The pizza was very good value, but quite literally tasted of nothing so I sprinkle black pepper to taste. Still no flavour. Am I going mad? I pour more black pepper than you have ever seen in your life on to my pizza; nothing. This was an early warning sign of things to come. Cheap Cheap Cheap!! 

Room finally booked, we are ushered up awkwardly by the bell boy. The room is not in a good state, plugs hanging out of the wall, lamp hanging off wall and telephone not connected to cable (see photos). Also, the aircon needs recharging as it blows only room temperature air. At least there was a safe, but they charge you for this, a first for me. On the positive side, there is a fridge, tv (bbc world news only) and free, yes FREE WiFi. 

You can't drink the tap water here, so we go to the shop down the road and buy a bottle of water only to be stopped by security saying we can't bring in water. I was furious!! Ok, I get it, no take aways or crates of beer but a bottle of water!? Come on. We argued and got our way, but I was annoyed and thoroughly enjoyed sneaking in all manor of contraband throughout the week.

After a day we had run out of toilet roll, not because of excessive use, but simply because we were given so little in the first place. I temporarily fix the phone and call reception, they say they will send some up immediately. 40 minutes later and no toilet roll. I decide to call room service and try my luck with them. When I asked to order toilet roll, the man on the end of the phone was very offended and abruptly hung up on us. So I call reception again, this time telling them that my girlfriend has been stuck on the toilet for 45 minutes. This seemed to work, but still they were not apologetic. 

Breakfast. Not terrible, but avoid the coffee. 

After a few days at the hotel, I get the feeling we are not wanted and by we, I mean myself (30) and my girlfriend (27). We are quiet, well mannered and not shy of tipping. By now I start to get the feeling that it is because we are white. I have never felt the victim of mild discrimination before and don't say it lightly, but when observing the behavior of staff around white guests and Asian/muslim guests, there is a clear difference. An example of this is when we were stopped entering the hotel with a bottle of water. A few days after this, on our way out we spotted 4 young asian/muslim lads all clutching Macdonalds bags, heading through the car park towards the main entrance. We watched, expecting them to be refused entry, instead they were greeted with a nod from security. I couldn't believe it! Hot Food!

The pool area. Nice, clean, spacious and with free games such as table tennis and darts. The entertainment staff are friendly and seem cool, although beware of having too much fun as a photographer will come and snap you then try to sell you prints. There is a bar area whereby you can order food and drink by the pool. Very pleasant indeed, food not great though. There is one problem I encountered with the pool and is worrying if you have small children. My girlfriend was on a sun-lounger and I was in the pool. I swam to the edge and rested my arms on the poolside to chat when out of nowhere my stomach was violently sucked in to a grapefruit sized hole under the water, if I was a few inches higher, it would have been my scrotum that was sucked in. Seriously, this was violent, like an animal attacking (see photos).

Location. A little out of the way of all the good stuff in Agadir such as beach, shops and restaurants, but not too far (12 mins walking). It is situated on a dual carriageway which is very noisy and the surrounding streets are in a terrible state (see photos). Personally I will never return to Agadir and unlikely Morocco. The country is stunning with gorgeous beaches and awe inspiring mountains. The food is mostly nice and very cheap. So why would I not return? The people. My god the people. We hired a car and the lane discipline of Moroccan drivers is shocking. They see us as white meat, only after money. They have no social skills and do not understand personal space. Of course this is to be expected in Souks etc, but seriously you can't go anywhere without being seriously harassed. Example. Driving though Tiznit, a stunning market town, we stop at lights and motor bikes see that we are white and start banging on our windows ""Hello. Hello. This way, you must come this way now!"" etc etc. This isn't the worst part. I am a photographer and wanted to spend one evening with the camera, we drove about 20 miles north and found a stunning stretch of coastline with not a town or building for 10 miles. Perfect. I pull over, get out of the car and take in the view. All of a sudden an old man appears from the cliffs below, like a predator in waiting. He mumbled a few words in French ""C'est Beau"" etc. I agreed. ""Oui, oui"". I walk away. He follows. I then say ""Au revoir"". He stares in to my eyes, like a man possessed. He then spots my GF in the car, he heads over, banging on the window demanding money. I run over, push him out of the way and get in the car, locking all doors. What happens next defies belief and I work in Byker. The man presses his face up against the window, staring intently, like a scene from a horror film. He has his hand tightly clasped on to the door handle still staring menacingly. We can't do a 3 point turn in case we back off the cliff, so we must drive forward down an unknown track. What if it is a dead end? He is chasing us. Logically I knew we were fine and we did escape, but the whole lack of social understanding worried me. If we broke down and he was the only person around, would he help? No.

Ok, to sum up.
Hotel is nice enough with some lovely communal areas and nice pool. Unfortunately its policies and unfriendly staff are the problem (30 minutes writing this in the snack bar with no offer of menu or drinks, had to finally call them over, even-though they served several other people). Location is average and area not pleasing on the eye. Room a bit shoddy. The hotel is well priced, but quality of food is not great. My biggest problem is how I feel when trying to enjoy the hotel, yes this might be my issue, but it is an issue which is created by this hotel. I have traveled all over the world and this is a first for me. My advice is to pay a little more and get a nice hotel nearer to the beach. You are sure of a better holiday."
"I and my husband have just returned from the argana. The hotel is terrible. On the first day we were given a room with broken lamp bulbs and stained bedding, I took a photo in my phone and went to reception to ask for another room, I was shocked furthermore as the response I got was ""it is better you change hotel if you not happy"". Then I showed another person checking out the photos he too was shocked, the guy at reception said come back at 9 am. We went back at 10 after breakfast and was told come at 12, at 12 told to come at 1. This was getting ridiculous we wanted to start our holiday. Finally got a decent room on 4th floor. 
Breakfast is also very limited, scrambled eggs, but we did notice if the waiters like you they will offer you omelettes or fried eggs. If your not there by 8.30am expect things like fruit salad and honey to have ran out. They make tea in a six cup Thermos with two teabags, its like drinking coloured water with no taste.
I will not be visiting this hotel again and definitely not reccomending it to family and friends."
"Lovely hotel, lovely staff but beware when you are eating in the restaurant in the evening. What I saw going on has shocked me and made me rethink this eating in this hotel. I saw a waiter taking the glasses off the tables where people had been drinking out on them wipe them with a serviette and then put them back to go out on to the table for new customer. I sat watching for a while and the same was done for side plates. I think that this is so disgusting  I will never drink from a glass there again. Never in my 25 years of catering have I seen anything like this. It must be stopped."
"Have just arrived at hotel Argana with a group for 2 nights.
After a days travelling I was looking forward to a nice hot shower, no such luck, water lukewarm.  Phoned reception who advised me they were fixing it!!!  One hour later, water even cooler.
Noted on bathroom wall, 7 suggestions to help environment, but the hotel are using plastic bags in the bathroom waste bin, of which we have seen many spread around Morocco during the last week.  The hotel should practice what they preach!
Bed in room 1114 also soft."
"We've been in Argana Hotel for two weeks. I'll begin from pros: good localisation near the beach. Now cons: 

terribly boring breakfast menu (two weeks of scrambled eggs anyone?)

Very loud music all day long till midnight, and i mean Ibiza style loud! Impossible to get some rest.

Uber uncomfy bed which will wake you up with backpain every morning. Every spring wants to get to know you. But hey! Time for breakfast.

Small 13"" crt tv that remembers old times. You could watch it if you have magnifying glass. But wait theres more! There is only ONE english speaking channel.

You should order paid water or drinks to the food or waiters will serve You morrocan style."
"We arrived and the hotel didn't have our booking. The lady at reception was lovely enough to take us to the office to see if I could get online and see what happened. We couldn't find it and I wasn't charged originally so we paid cash. This is where the good experience ended. We were forced to pay upfront which is unusual, and weren't given the option to opt out of breakfast - which we didn't want.
We went into our room, the toilet hasn't been cleaned from the previous guest even though it had a sign to say it has been disinfected, we called reception to come up and clean it. We then decided to take a shower and we couldn't take off the plug for the drain so the bath was filling up with water so both my friend and I couldn't have a shower without being in each other's dirty water. We were told 15mins as they were breaking fast. (we travelled during ramadan). We understood this and waited. We called again and they said 5mins, 40mins later. We left the room for dinner. We were dirty and hadn't gone to the bathroom!
We came back after dinner and the toilet was clean and they fixed the bathroom by removing the plug. 
They had music playing all night till 1:30am, called reception and they turned the music down for 5 mins and it went up again. We should've been advised this was a noisy room.

The next morning, the breakfast staff were very friendly but breakfast was very average.
We went to the pool and were asked to leave a 100MAD deposit (about 13 Australian dollars) to use a towel for the pool. Which is ridiculous considering the price of the hotel.
I complained to reception about all the problems and I was offered a different room, which didn't help me as I needed a room last night when we had the original problems. 

Our room was facing the pool and the hotel entertainment (volleyball match) sounded like it was being playing in my room. The room had thin walls and I could hear everything in the other rooms (moving furniture etc). The cleaner forgot her cleaning products in our bathoom, while I was trying to nap, the door opened and I thought it was my friend but the cleaner entered the room without knocking and collected them. Very unprofessional.

Besides all this the walls in our room were dirty, the tav was tiny and at least 15 years old. This hotel looks much better from the outside then it does on the inside.

On check out, I wasn't even asked how my stay was and the staff did not offer to help us get a taxi. 

I would not ever recommend this hotel, I feel like I was totally ripped off. A total waste of money. If this hotel was a 5th of the price. I would expect more. 

The only positive about this hotel was in general the staff were really really nice but slow to action most of the time (except the breakfast staff who were great) and it full of package tourists. 
If you want any value for your money do not stay here."
"First of all, in no way, shape or form is the hotel 4 stars, at best three stars. 

Amenities - old and dainted - they have an excellent photographer so please disregard them. When we first entered our room it smelled of paint and in the new one everything looks as if its about to break. Not what you expect from a four star hotel.

Food - tasteless. I feel as if I have left Morocco when I stepped foot here. Besides their terrible salad, their breakfast was limited in choice and it feels as if they've bought the cheapest food to save money.

Computers - I felt transported to the mid 1990s when I tried to log on.

Others - staff are all right though not overly hospitable, pool seems fine and location is ok though it's like a 25 min walk to the beach.

Conclusion: look around and perhaps spend a bit more on a hotel in Agadir. The town seems to be a bit more expensive than Marrakech and fez so perhaps you need to spend more to get the same level of comfort."
"I've just got back from a 5 night stay at the Argana and overall I was disappointed, it's a long way from 4 star. My room was quite dated and could have been a lot cleaner - the balcony railing didn't look as though it had been washed this year and there was so much dirt in a gap around the edge of the dressing table top that could easily have been cleaned. The air conditioning was also very temperamental and for the last few days would only work at all if I selected heat! The linen was clean but the room generally could have been much cleaner. It also looked very tired, especially the bathroom.

The food was poor too both in terms of variety and quality. The Moroccan night was nice but the other nights left a lot to be desired - flavour for example! The breakfast selection was probably one of the poorest I've ever seen in a hotel - scrambled eggs, pancakes, cornflakes, bread and croissants and for some reason salad! It's the first time I've ever seen grated carrot, cucumber and pepper on a breakfast buffet! Many of the restaurant staff were also quite surly, particularly the chef who would glare at anyone who dared to put the buffet tray lids down the wrong way. There was absolutely no atmosphere in the dining room, holiday hotel restaurants are usually buzzing but the only things buzzing in the Argana were the flies.

On the first three nights I had a drink in the hotel bar. Despite being a nice area and very spacious, I never saw more than two other people in there and the barman made no attempt at conversation. There was a nice outdoor terrace but no lights were ever switched on in the evening to make anyone want to sit out there.

The pool area was the probably the only outstanding area of the hotel. The pool is big and clean and there are plenty of sun beds  around it so it didn't feel crowded at all. Unfortunately they like to play horrendous music very loudly around the pool area but otherwise it is nice. The hotel also has an area on the beach but after having my 'hotel passport' scrutinised by the man there I was told I would have to pay to use it. As it's not the nearest beach area to the hotel I can't really see the point in paying to use it, I paid the same price to use a much closer part of the beach.

If the hotel had been marketed as a 2 star or possibly a 3 then I would have been quite happy. It still should be cleaner and the staff could make an effort to be friendly and create an atmosphere but my expectations of a 4 star hotel are much higher than what's being offered here."
"We stayed in this Hotel Argana for two weeks in August 2011. The hotel is classed as four stars, although Thompson state they have classified it as three ‘T’s’, it is at best three stars, but probably only really deserves two stars. On the transfer to the hotel from the airport we realised that only one other person was staying there, on reflection this doesn’t surprise me.
We booked our holiday at the last minute, four days before we travelled; we asked for a quiet resort and it is worth noting that Agadir is definitely not quiet. Agadir is a busy seaside resort with a vibrant nightlife. 
We arrived at the hotel late and although check in was smooth and staff suitably friendly we were soon to have a disappointing start to our holiday when we got to our room. The room was basic, dated and the television black and white. However the room and the hotel in general can be described as clean. Once we settled into our room we decided to get an early night, although any hope of a good night’s sleep were soon to be irradiated. We found that the bed was old and particularly uncomfortable. A little later the very loud music from a nearby nightclub started, the noise from the nightclub could be even heard once the balcony doors had been shut. 
The next morning we had to endure a further disappointment when we went down to the restaurant for our breakfast, which was included in the price of our holiday. The buffet breakfast consisted of dry pastries and bread, tinned meats, tasteless (also possibly tinned) fruit, average yoghurt, undistinguishable egg products (omelettes and maybe crepes), watered down possible freshly squeezed orange juice, undrinkable coffee and just about drinkable tea. The disappointed with the breakfast was amplified due to the fact that the representative from our holiday company, on the transfer from the airport, had described the vast amount of high quality fruit and vegetables the country produces. Needless to say we eventually decided that we would start eating at local cafes for breakfast or not having breakfast at all. 
Fortunately we had declined to go half board and didn’t have to eat in the hotel restaurant for our evening meal. I say fortunately because the one night we decided to eat at the hotel we found the food of an extremely low quality and very expensive.  We ate in many local restaurants where the food was excellent and significantly cheaper. For example we eat a restaurant specialising in Moroccan and Italian food, the menu prepared by a cordon bleu chef, it only cost us a 200 dirham more.
We did mention our various problems to our representative the next day at the welcome meeting and they did offer to move us to a different room and provided us with extra pillows. When I mentioned my disappointment in regards to the breakfast, our representative told me that they had 97% satisfaction rating with the food in the hotel. I would have been very interested to see how they came up with that particular statistic. 
One of the things that we were particularly looking forwarded to was having a daily swim in the large swimming pool at the hotel. Although the swimming pool looks crystal clear on the promotional photographs what we found when we arrived what can be only be described as ‘murky pool’. The water in the pool got worse and eventually was inspected. Notices were then put up around the hotel, it seemed that the pool had failed this inspection. The pool was then cleaned thoroughly and on the last few days of our holiday you may have considered it okay to use. 
If I had to find some positives to the hotel I would say that it was very clean, the location was where we had expected and most of the staff were friendly most of the time."
"Being a regular visitor to Agadir, recently I stayed at Hotel Argana for a change. I have stayed in Argane previously and had enjoyed the experience. However this time I noted a big drop in standards. The room needs updating and the fridge was broken. The internet connection in the lobby was very hit and miss...more miss than hit!  However my biggest disappointmet was with the staff. Although some were are friendly and helpful, one young lady at the reception overcharged me for the safe for the week and when I asked for my recepit ( twice) she would NOT give it although she asked me to sign before keeping it. The poolside was disappointing as it the week I was there it was hard to find anyone at the pool-side bar let alone be served.  Needless to say I wont be back to the Argana."
"Before you book the Argana hotel please read this review and don't be fooled by the other good reviews. We read them, believed them and actually had to check them again when we returned home as we thought we had checked out the wrong hotel. We booked this hotel based on the trip advisor reviews and in future I will take the reviews with a pinch of salt. We arrived on Saturday 11th September and after our key was thrown at us by the very rude reception staff, we proceeded to take the lift to our room. The lift went down and would not go up again. After 2 calls to reception to get us out - the second one answered with 'We said we are sending someone down' we were eventually helped out by the maintenance man. This man, as it happens we got to see very regularly that night. The first room we went into, the balcony door would not lock. The second room, the water in the shower came from the wall and not the shower head. The fridge in this room was filthy and the air con stank. We moved to our third room at the help of the rep as reception was reluctant to move us again. In this room the air con also stank and the one only working socket in the room, was the one for the fridge. We complained again on the Sunday and got moved to our fourth yes fourth room. The room was an 'upgrade' which meant we had a bit more floor space. The air con still stank and despite complaining to the rep (who did ask the hotel to fix it as we were not the only ones complaining) nothing changed. In each room there was a maintenance request and on Tuesday and Wednesday we hung this request on our door. The hotel made no contact with us and did not even acknowledge they had received the request. At this stage we gave up. The smell was really disgusting and no amount of air freshener or candles could get rid of it. Despite the rooms being clean, the smell was in your clothes so even when you left the hotel, you still got it. Every morning you had a choice of waking up feeling sick if you left the air con on or not sleeping because it was too hot. Our ‘upgraded’ room was on the ground floor so we were reluctant to leave the patio door open.
 The reception staff were probably the rudest I have ever come across. Everything was a hassle to them. No matter what you asked them, they would sigh and haul themselves off their seat and bark the answer to your question. I asked them to book a restaurant for dinner and I was charged 3.5 dirham (aprox 35 cent) for the phone call. The bar staff were not great either and as soon as you looked at them you were expected to tip them. The music in the bar was too loud and full of cheesy pop music. The hotel signature song that was played every night was Kiss Kiss by Holly Valance. Need I say more? There was 4 internet p.c.s and most of the time they did not work. When you did managed to get a ticket to log on and get a computer that was actually working, you actually spent most of your time figuring out the keyboard. We were lucky enough not to be staying 1/2 board as the quality of the breakfast was very poor so I dread to think what the lunch and dinner were like. There was a cold meat in the buffet that looked to me to be canned Spam. Needless to say I didn’t taste it to be sure.
The walk to the beach was not too long but any time you walked by a shop you were hassled to come in. There was no way you could browse in the shops as you felt under too much pressure to buy. Someone should explain to these shop owners that hassling people to come into a shop only makes them walk away.
The taxis in the resort are like death traps. No seat belts in the back of the car and in fact most of the seats were loose as you drove around. I would say that most of the drivers obviously went to the same charm school as the hotel reception staff.
You go on holiday to relax and enjoy yourself but unfortunately the Argana is NOT the place to do this. Then to top off the ‘perfect’ week we were delayed 10 hours on the way home. Although this had nothing to do with the hotel it couldn’t have been a more perfect ending to the most disastrous week. I have never been so glad to eventually be back on Irish soil."
"A week in this hotel is 7 days too many! Some of the reviews are very kind in the extreme and I wondered if they were referring to the same hotel we stayed at last week. From here on I won't be trusting the reviews on TripAdvisor - usually so reliable but what has happened here???

The poisitives first. A good pool area. Rooms can be decent though many people complained of a strong smell of sewage from their rooms or inadeauate air conditioning. And the cleaners were reasonable. And there it ends.

People staying half board were the unlucky ones. One couple changed to breakfast only after one night. The food is atrociuous, even our Rep admitted that she was sick of hearing these complaints every week (she suggested we write to our Tour operator directly). Many of the regular goers acknowledged that the food has gone downhill in recent months, but if you cannot even provide fresh bread for breakfast then lunch / dinner is clearly too much to cope with! Worst breakfast we've ever had at a hotel.

The 4 computer internet area would be ok were it not for the keyboards with the letters rubbed off, and the usual broken terminals.

The location is well off the beaten track. 10 minutes from the sea, in an area where my wife did not feel at all safe. A mugging on the laneway by the hotel was witnessed on the first night - great!!!

The bar staff expect tips for smiling at you! The drink is expensive in the bar but not objectionable.

The reception staff were surly, refusing to explain or apologise for failings. Amongst those were the exchange desk opening when it suited and not when advertised.  The constant recommendation of a restaurant which we were all warned about (why let good food get in the way of making pals a little business), and this got in the way of requests from us that they book other places for us (they refused). The final straw was when we missed a pick up from a restaurant we had booked, because the doorman and counter staff failed to tell us that the pickup was outside. They blamed the restaurant but it was evident that this kind of error has happened at this hotel previously.

Final word on the resort itself. Not recommended but we were put off by a dreadful hotel (cheap usually means crap I'm afraid) and very poor weather (3 days of clouds). Sorry Morocco but we won't be coming back."
"I have stayed in Argana the start of October and I have to say it is definitely NOT a 4*Hotel! It's clean, but very old, staff doesn't speak English, towels and toilet paper was often missing from our room and we had to request it several times from the reception to get it. TV didn't work. Staff expects tips for looking at you (I mean they expect tips for everything). Swimming pool is freezing, bottle of water in the hotel is at least 6 times more expensive then in a local shop. I didn't like breakfast either - every day same little poor selection of old pastries and sweetened orange juice, not to mention only white cheese and some hossible ham-ish thing. Really dissapointed. I would never recommend it!!!!"
"I Was There In July 2009 - With A Cosmo Morocco Tour For 5 Nights .... 
This Was Not A Four Star Hotel - Rooms Are Basic - Air Con Is Rubbish - Complained But Was Told It's The Same All Over The Hotel Not Just You're Room .....I Did Not Know That They Still Had 10 Inch TV With An Antenna Sticking Out Any More - But That's What Was In The Room ...... The Staff Are Sometimes Over Bearing To Help As They Are Only After Tips From The Foreign Tourist  ...... Even The Hotel Snake Charmer Posing With His Snake Around Your Neck So The Hotel Photographer Can Take Your Photo ..Whispers In Your Ear For 50 Dirham's .... Some People Paid ... I Told Him To Get Stuffed..... Breakfast Was Very Poor - The Only Hot Food Was Watery Scrambled Eggs & Pancakes ...... I Lived On Bread & Jam With A Cup Of Coffee Every Breakfast .... But The Evening Meal Was Very Good / Plenty Of Meat With Vegetables ...............The Snack Side Poll  Was Expensive For Basic Fair ---- They Sold You A Bottle Of Sprite With The Manufacture Price On The Label ( 3 Dirham's ( 21 Pence ) ) ...But You Paid 22 Dirham's ( £1.54 )............Massive Greedy Rip Off .............................The Bar Prices Were Expensive £2.50 for a Half Pint Bottle Of Beer ..........................They Need To Get Wise If They Want British To Come ... They Must Stop Over Charging ... Improve The TV Sets In The Rooms ... Sort Out The Air Con ...... 
The Beach Is Just Down The Road -- But It Is Public Beach With Thousands Of People On It  ....... God Only Knows Where They Went To The Toilets ... There Was None Around Only The Bars And Restaurants Had The Toilets And You Had To Buy Something Before They Let You Use Them ...... And I Know They Never ............We Never Used The Beach"
"Hotel was very basic. Pure waste of our money. Paid for a 4* hotel & got a 2*, only classed as a 4* as it has a swimming pool. Pool was not cleaned so we could not use it. Cats were everywhere & one couple had a cat go to the toliet on their beach towel which they left by the poolside. Breakfast very basic, consists of cheese & bread & pancakes which were prepared very unhygenically. No entertainment on site. Do not book any excursions without the help of hotel staff as they rip you off. Not happy with the overall experience & we would certainly not consider returning. Complained to Sunway 8 weeks ago & still waiting on reply....
.."
"ok well the argana hotel is not a 4 * hotel at all. I have just come back from morocco myself and my boyfriend went, and to be hones firstly i wouldnt reccommend morocco it is so boaring, theres nothing to do, the tours that there are to do are really bad, everything over there is money, money, and more money, they try to rip the tourest off so much, you have no idea, if you are ordering food make sure you get a reciept as we found a lot of people were trying to charge us without showing a reciept, so be carefull of that.

anyway about the argana hotel, we arrieved there and were waitring at reception for the guy to get off the phone to check us in, after about 6 mins we got checked in, we went upstairs to our room...... there was two single beds in it, so we asked to be changed to a double room, that was ok, went to the next room which was a connecting room, it was reallt small, there was no fridge in the roon, it was only average clean, there were tiles in the room not a bit of carpet in sight - horrible, there was a tv we thaught this was great, when we turned it on everything was in arabic apart from sky news so this was abit crap not a goos start to the holiday the only good thing about our room was that we could see the pool.  

we could hear the couple next dooe snooring and what ever else it was horrible.  when we asked at the reception about haveing no fridge in the room the guy shrugged his shoulders and siad nothing, we didnt even bother saying anything about the connecting room because we were so discusted we just kept saying - it cant get any worse but believe me it did.

people working at the hotel were great if you TIP every single time you order something and if you dont TIP your totally ignorred, the cleaners were the same if we TIPPED we go an extra pillow and our clothes were nicely folded if we didnt the pillow was gone.

as you can see i wouod not reccomment this hotel, seriously it is not a 4* theres a gym and a sauna and a spa but you have to pay to use everything, and there way too over prised.

i wouldnt reccomment this atall

good luck"
"We travelled to Morocco from Ireland in July - there were three of us, and all of us were really looking forward to the trip. Based on reviews from this site, we thought we were in for a treat. It turned out we really weren't. On arrival, the coach service was great, collected from airport and dropped to hotel, had a talk from tour rep en route. All was well. The hotel lobby is impressive, full height ceiling (I think the hotel is 5 stories high) in the atrium, etc. The rooms however, were a different story. I am conscious of giving a fair review so I'll keep it simple. On the first night, the full height atrium, which at first looked so attractive, proved to be a disaster in terms of noise. Our rooms were on the fourth floor and we could hear everything in the lobby as the sound travelled. That was manageble, except there was a Berber night beside the pool (the other side of our rooms) and that continued for hours, at a deafening rate. Noise aside, and bearing in mind that noise in itself is not the main issue, the problems with the hotel became apparent immediately. The beds were very well worn, the shower was broken so I requested it be fixed - three maintenance men came into my room at 11.30pm, and my very poor French was stretched to the limit asking them to leave it til tomorrow, but they continued (which was actually ok, as we all need to shower). I got up to see what the shower problem was and nearly got sick when i saw them removing what looked like huge amounts of hair from the shower head. Don't ask me how it got there, I take pride in my ignorance of Moroccan plumbing. Anyway, that was actually all ok. We moved rooms the next day due to the noise. Also due to the damp pillows and mattresses.  On a positive note, breakfast is lovely, there are two fresh food stations every morning, one serving omelettes, eggs, etc and another serving doughnuts or some other freshly cooked speciality. This is on top of the usual buffet breakfast which was lovely. HOWEVER we had chosen half board, which meant dinner every night. Were we sorry. My god. I have never seen boiled onions and hard boiled eggs served as a main course. ON THE SAME PLATE. We ate out about 3 nights of the 7. It was horrendous. And we're not fussy. Well, not much. Really. Anyway, the pool was nice, but music is piped continously throughout the day so if that bothers you, don't go here. There is also a very enthusiastic pool entertainment team, who are hard to shake off. Shades on and looking the other way seemed to work though. This is very much a Muslim country, so as three females we found it difficult to be alone on the street, not in a threatening way, more in a bothersome way. We walked home from a restaurant one night (at about 8pm) and there were literally men hanging out of cars honking at us (and we're not that hot, believe me). To echo some of the other reviewers, two of us got incredibly ill. I am reluctant to place any blame on the food in the hotel, as I have heard stomach complaints are very common in Morocco due to the change in diet so I couldn't comment on that any further. I do know there is a helpful (and I reckon very profitable) pharmacist about 10 metres from the hotel and he was brilliant in recommending potions to alleviate the suffering. 
We summed up the entire trip by saying none of us would return if we were given free flights, accomodation, food and spending money. But maybe that's just us."
"We stayed for two days at this hotel. Let's not be harsh and say it was OK.

On the plus side are the pleasant service (except the restaurant  and its amateurish waiters), a couple of nice-looking lounges (look for the oriental room) and a good swimming pool.

On the minus side, well ... some rooms are very noisy with a  furniture that looks cheap.  Bathrooms are somewhat crudely decorated (see exposed water pipes under the sink). Waiters at the restaurant can be rude (girlfriend scoffed at by staff because she used a coffee cup to put some jam in. So what ...).

Actually, on second thought, this hotel is just terrible.
"
"This hotel had a outbreak of food poisoning while we were there. A majority of the guests were very sick and the staff did not seem to care at all and put it down to 'climate change'. It was not just the European people who were sick but a lot of the Moroccans and Algerians holidaying there were as well. So how can they say it is climate change. 

When I tried to make a formal complaint, because my travelling companion had been sick in bed for two weeks, they would not accept it and I was told to put my complaint in the 'suggestion box' . Appalling. I would not allow my children to eat in the hotel from the second week and we spent their meal times in Pizza Hut and McDonalds. Hardly Moroccan but I was terrified that they would get this nasty virulent food bug. Anoither couple went home early for the same reason. Almost all the guests we spoke to had the same bug. Nothing was done and the hotel staff did not give a damn. 

We also met a honeymoon couple who had been sick in bed all week. 

DON'T GO THERE.
"
"We stayed at this glorified youth hostel this month supposedly for 2 weeks but cut our holiday short due to this hotels' severe lack of basic cleanliness, service, amenities, food.....need I go on? We and many other people there were extremeley ill with severe sickness and diarrohea which I have no doubt was caused by the unhygienic conditions in this hotel. There is no way that this hotel is worthy of 4 stars. For a backpacker on a budget expecting the worst then yes, but for a family expecting a nice relaxing holiday in a clean environment, then no.
"
"My self and my travelling companion Seamus booked a 2 week holiday in this dump. It felt like 2 months and we thought we would never get out of it. It was supposed to be 4*, 2* more like.
The biggest problem, apart from the hordes of beggers on the streets and freeloaders in the bars, was the food.
It was just a well we brought plenty of immodium. Poor ould Seamus was destroyed entirely. he was running morning, noon and night and I was'nt much better myself. No matter what we ate it seemed to go straight through us.
So be warned. brink a cork!
"
"The staff was ok till some problems appeared... Some day i came back to my hotel room and found it opened, checked everything, fortunately nothing was stolen. I reported the case at the reception, they promised the situation would not repeat again. I didn't have to wait long, the very next day it happened again and repeated untill my flying back ??? !!!!! The maid having cleaned my room never lock it !  They did nothing ! (maybe they wanted make me pay for their safe?) 
      The second thing is that you mustn't invite any friends who are not the hotel guests to your room. If you come here with your family you won't probably find such a problem as mine but i went there alone for my second part who is the citizen of Morocco. I got a present from him and we wanted to leave it in my room. The moment we came to the lift the guard appeared next to us announcing IN ARABIC to my fiance ""if you wanna enter her room you can go to the (he gave him the name of the other hotel) "" Can you imagine how i felt when my love translated that for me ? When you're there you're under their arabic laws. Till the last day i felt  awful staying  and seeing them every time. They assume that if you're an european and came here as a single you had ""a bad aim"" to do so!  But that is nothing if one wants to know what happened the last day. All my group was waiting in their waiting room till the coach came to transfer us to the airport , naturally we were there together For God sake those were the last minues spending together, but after some minutes the guard came and this time told my love to leave this place immediately. Imagine how  would you feel? i WILL NEVER COME BACK THERE AGAIN , NEVER and none of my friends go there either
     If you're a single forget about this (-) hotel ! (sorry ,i can't find a better word) 
     You can be 100% sure of the honesty of my story I hope that i will help at least 1 person to make a good choice.
"
"came back on the 13th july... hotel very expensive £1.50 for a coke !! not able to bring any drinks or food in from outside - they search you.

"Agadir is a touristic location, tranquil, safe and has a pleasant beach area. There are many hotels in this area and we choose to stay at Argana 4* hotel in our 4 day stay in Agadir. Argana hotel is located about 500m from the beach and realistically it takes 15-20 minutes to get to the actual beach. The staff are nice and friendly but there is a general feeling that they are underpaid and you need to tip....everybody will kindly hint to you! 
 The greatest dissappointment is the food! It is generally bad compared to any normal 3 star hotel. In the morning you are offered very few choices that remain the same the rest of your stay. The most exciting thing is scrambled eggs and pancakes which look and taste like bread rather than pancakes. We went with two children and on one of the ""Italien nights"" my daughter who is generally not picky did not want to eat anything except melon. The only evening with good food was the Morrocan night which included musicians. However, that will be your only night of palitable food. Dont expect anything extra special. We would like to recomment to the hotel that it would be a worthy investment to train one of the chefs to learn to cook continental food because all the evenings we ate there was a tasteless bland experience! 
  The rooms are clean, however, the bed for two adults is really good for two children!
  The pool area is clean and people are helpful bringing towels. The little cafe restaurant near the pool we used during one lunch period was also not impressive!
  The beach at Agadir is nice and sandy and we went on an excursion with camels which cost us 350dirhams (35 Euros) for two camels (2 adults and 2 children). It lasted 2.5 hours. It was a nice experience and the children enjoyed it!
  Generally prices and tips expected are the same as anywhere in Europe so to eat you would need minimum 10   Euros per head not including drinks! 
  One restaurant we felt was good was Le Jardin which is 100m from the hotel. They have very good fish plates! 
  We have returned recently and three of the members of the family have a serious stomach pain and diarrhoea. However, we still dont know what may have been the culprit....the food or the water?
