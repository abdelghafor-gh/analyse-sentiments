"Booked a superior garden / pool room for 9 nights. 

On arrival was told they are full but they kindly give us an upgrade to a suite. 

I’m now sitting in a small room looking out at the air conditioning units and a roof top. I have complained but they tell me it’s an upgrade and they have nothing else. 

Totally ruined my wedding anniversary. 

Very overpriced anyway and even worse when you don’t get what you booked."
"Starting with Positives, Hotel garden and pool areas are very beautiful and our room Opera Suite was really spacious and elegantly decorated with lots of storage space. Hotel location is good just outside of key attractions and markets. Also breakfast was very good with multiple live cooking stations and large variety of high quality items. Check-in was very quick and efficient.

But behind this beautiful surface, hotel has major issue with the service as many other reviewers have also pointed out, so seem management is not acting on the issues noted in these reviews. Let me give some highlights:

In the breakfast you are asked for coffee and orange juice when you arrive, but after this it is impossible to get refills. Even if you manage to get hold of one waiter, there is no change they will actually bring something. Last morning I tested and waited 20 mins after my order, but then left with the family...

One evening we arrive in hotel around 18 and asked door staff how long pools are open, we were told that until 8PM, we went to pool around 18.45 and some 5-6 other travelers on pool, but no towels. We asked the pool staff for towels and they said they will bring, but then 19 all the staff left and no towels were delivered!

And thirdly on the morning we were checking out I was asking reception that they would  collect our luggage at certain time, but gentleman behind the desk said i need to call the porter when I want to get them to be picked. Seem even this kind of small task is too much for them to do!

I could continue with many more examples...well matching with other reviews.

So if you like to wonder around wet in the dark corridors after the swim and are happy to take care of you own luggage and do not need 2nd cup of coffee this is your hotel;) 

Otherwise I would select some other option. And finally if someone in hotel actually reads these reviews I am still waiting clarification of extra 130eur charge on my bill. I have now asked 3 times for the receipt to check what this charge is so I can see if is ok. Next request goes directly to Accor Legal and the CEO.

"I recently stayed in a Junior Suite at the Sofitel Hotel in Marrakesh, and while the property has potential, there are several areas that could be significantly improved. My intention with this review is to highlight some issues that other guests might want to be aware of.

	•	Noise Levels: Unfortunately, the rooms are not soundproofed, and the music from the on-site outdoor club was extremely disruptive. On one night, I couldn’t sleep until after 2:30 a.m. because the music was so loud, even with earplugs in. The club operates until 4 a.m. every night, and the noise really affected our experience. Loud music is also played by the pool during the daytime on the opposite side of the hotel, meaning it’s noisy no matter what side of the hotel you stay on. Guests sensitive to noise may want to consider this.

	•	Food Quality: The restaurants were disappointing, with inconsistent quality and limited options. For example, we tried the Moroccan food by the pool, but the meat was overcooked and lacked flavor. The fries were not what was advertised—just bits of fried potato. For a hotel of this caliber, the dining experience fell short. I was really disappointed that there wasn’t a decent on-site dining option. This became a bigger issue than expected, as the hotel has a policy of no outside food or drink. If you’re planning a relaxing pool day, you won’t have the option of enjoying tasty food.

	•	Inconvenient Access to Information: The hotel uses QR codes for all information and menus, which was frustrating due to the unreliable Wi-Fi. I would have preferred paper copies to avoid constantly using my phone, especially since some menus were mislabeled between English and French.

	•	Housekeeping Issues: Housekeeping service was inconsistent. You need to have a “do not disturb” sign on the door whenever you’re in the room, as staff would enter without knocking, which was intrusive. One day, our room wasn’t cleaned until after 6 p.m., which made it difficult for us to get ready for dinner. The turn-down service also lacked the attention to detail I would expect from a luxury hotel. Additionally, I thought it was cheeky to charge for using the Nespresso machine in the room—other hotels of this standard offer complimentary coffee machine use.

	•	Pool Area: Service by the pool needs improvement. Staff were not attentive, and the advertised number of pools was misleading—there are two main pools, not three. The third pool is reserved for members, but this is not made clear in promotional materials. A buzzer system for poolside service would be helpful, and I also felt the hotel could offer water coolers, as many five-star hotels do. Considering the price, this would be a nice touch.

	•	Staff and Management: There seemed to be a lack of effective management. While there were many staff members, they often appeared disengaged, and several were on their phones. On two occasions, I felt uncomfortable when staff asked me to leave positive reviews with their names included, which didn’t feel appropriate. It appeared management was asking them to do this under the incentive to make career progression within the hotel. If management was more present there would be no need for this. Additionally, when I asked for simple guidance about taxi fares, I received a rude and unhelpful response.

	•	Final Night Experience & Lack of Management Response: The most disappointing moment was on our final night when a restaurant reservation arranged by the hotel wasn’t honored. Despite checking multiple times with the concierge, we arrived at the restaurant to find no reservation had been made, and we were told there was a dress code, which the hotel had misinformed us about. The hotel’s handling of the situation was poor, with a receptionist laughing when we briefly returned to the hotel to change and express our disappointment. It was only after we became upset that they arranged a hotel car to take us back to the restaurant, but this didn’t make up for the stress or the hours of our final evening lost. The restaurant, in contrast, was incredibly professional and made every effort to accommodate us despite the mix-up. Despite multiple requests, I never got to speak to a manager, which made it feel like the hotel didn’t really care about resolving the issue. This lack of responsiveness from management was particularly frustrating and honestly ruined our last night in Marrakesh.

While the hotel has some appealing features, including its location, decor and large pool area, these issues greatly impacted my stay. I believe significant improvements in management, service, and attention to detail are urgently needed. Personally for the price I would seriously consider staying elsewhere in Marrakesh."
"Hotel booked a private event with no courtesy of notifying their guests. My family wasn’t allowed to use the pool or bar area for the day or the night and the music BLASTED until 1am. Hotel manager absolutely no help other to say it’ll stop soon. 
There are plenty of great hotels in the area and if I would’ve known this I’d be elsewhere to be up early to enjoy the beauty of Marrakesh not listening to this garbage."
"A beautiful hotel in a great location but the experience was ruined for me due to the insanely loud volume of music playing until late every evening. I was unable to sit on my balcony and have a conversation, that's how loud it was. And my suite was at the far end of the hotel, away from the sound system by the pool which echoes around the whole hotel. Music went on until at least midnight, sometimes later. I don't know how the hotel can call itself family friendly."
"The hotel facilities are fine but our stay here was very disappointing. 

It’s the small things that make a difference at supposedly high end hotels, mainly around service, and these were very much lacking. 

Starting with check in, we arrived early, 2 hours before the check in time of 1500, and whilst the room was not available, we did do all the paperwork. 

We didn’t expect an early check in, but then we were left to wait in the lobby for a further 1.5 hours after 1500, supposedly because we had requested adjacent rooms as we were travelling as a family.

When we got to the rooms they were not next to each other, but as we didn’t want to wait any longer we just accepted it.

Shortly after, one of the rooms lost all electrical power. These things happen, but what is not acceptable is having to report it 3 times and being left for an hour in a sweltering room with no AC (it was 40 degrees that day), before someone came to fix it.

Other examples of the sloppy nature of the management and service were; a failure to replace coffees sachets each day, even when asked to three times; the breakfast buffet starting at 0700 but not being full prepared at opening, which is not convenient when you have to check out early to catch a flight; room service taking a very long time for a simple request for ice; turn down service is random, so nights you get it, others you don’t; and more…

We tried to take our issues to the management and were fobbed off, told we would be contacted , but nothing materialised. Eventually we gave up chasing it, it was clear that no one cared. In general, a lot of the staff seem disinterested and not service oriented, and that’s a reflection on how they are being led in my opinion. 

First world problems I know, but when you have one annual holiday to look forward to, and are spending your hard earned cash on a special “5 star” experience, one would expect better. I would seriously consider whether to stay in a Sofitel establishment again."
"I am writing to formally express my dissatisfaction with the billing process during my recent stay 
Upon reviewing my bill, I noticed that I was charged more than what I should pay and I had to pay cash  at the property after stating the matter to the management they told me that their colleague is right and I’m the one who’s wrong that I didn’t count properly .more than this they asked me to get my money back as a favor from their side to hide that their colleague stole me intentionally 
These issues significantly impacted my comfort and overall experience and what surprised me from a 5 star hotel that no one cares about their guest  or about the customer service or trying to assist,  the most important thing is their colleague and of course always the guest is wrong 
That was the most important issue more I order only water in the morning and I had to wait for more than 45 min no one assisted me until I found a lady by mistake by the door who assisted with the water plus a lot of amenities are missing in the room"
"A very bad experience with one of the staff tried to use his power over me although I'm a platinum member. Definitely not coming back here for being mistreated and the un polite behaviour, had to change hotel although I'm still in marrakesh
For more information I request management to approach me as this is definitely not acceptable "
"Disappointing Experience at Sofitel Marrakech

Our stay at Sofitel Marrakech was extremely disappointing. The service at check-in was poor, and the issues only continued from there. We requested a soup for our infant, and it arrived with fish bones, spilling all over the platter. We had to send it back. When we also requested a glass of milk for the baby, we were charged for it. We requested a crib for our baby upon check-in, but it didn't arrive until midnight, causing great inconvenience.

Our pool experience was also terrible. We had to find a place ourselves and fetch towels on our own, with no waiters available. It took an hour to get our food.

The most frustrating part was the manager's response during checkout. Despite showing her the issues we faced, she was dismissive and acted as if our complaints were unfounded. This was the worst experience I've had at any All Accor property. We ended up checking out the next day and moving to a different hotel, even though I am a Gold member with All Accor. They clearly don't care about your membership status.

To anyone considering staying here, I highly recommend choosing a different property.

Lahouari R"
"I am currently staying in this hotel, and I wanted to let people know that this hotel is far from a 5 star hotel. Not sure where to start from, when we arrived we wasn’t greeted with the friendly staff people have stayed in there reviews. I have travelled with my elderly parents and even then we were given a room which involved so much walking. I have stayed in many 5 star hotels around the world and honestly it’s not even been 24 hours and I have a list of things which aren’t what 5 star hotels offer, like room slippers haven’t been provided, we have asked many times and we still haven’t been given any. Towels didn’t get replaced, we opted for half board and we understand that drinks aren’t included in this, but when we brought our own drinks from a supermarket we was being refused firstly to even take the drinks to our room, the hotel charges around £7-£8 for a glass of milk for you to make tea in your room which is ridiculous. If anyone is thinking of coming to Marrakesh I would not recommend this hotel if you are looking for a 5 star hotel. Even a small bottle of water is around £5, I wouldn’t mind paying these prices if the hotel was upto the 5 star standard they make them self to be."
"After a great stay at this hotel ,the whole experience has been ruined by not receiving a refund of my room deposit.
I have returned from this hotel and nearly 5 weeks later still no refund.
After numerous phone calls and constant emails i still find myself in this position.
   I feel completely let down by this hotel ,and terrible customer service."
"Totally underwhelmed and unimpressed staff and reception staff do not react when you have a complaint, they nod heads and then walk away. Ordered a meal which took an eternity to arrive and when it did it was cold (trio burgers and chips), corridors were dim struggled to see to get to room. Ironed a shirt and rust came out of the iron and stain my shirt this was cleaned by hotel but no apology, I have stayed at far more high end hotels and never experienced such slow service and poor attitudes by staff (rudeness TBH)."
"We’ve never given such varied ratings to one property, e.g., a spectacularly good breakfast buffet, probably our best ever and with super great staff (see restaurant ratings, including we started a new thread on that Jardin restaurant).  And we’ve stayed at multiple Sofitels and loved them!  Still, we have to be frank and fair about the non-food issues as we are rating the hotel with this review.  Let’s start with our explicit arrangements by my wife that were all triple checked before leaving the US to get picked up at the airport by the Sofitel’s arranged concierge staff.  Were they there? No.  Did they show up 15-20 minutes late? No.  Did they try to contact us on our cell phones? No.  We searched back inside the terminal where baggage claim is coming out, and then again just outside the door many times to be sure.  Nope, our name was on no one’s piece of paper.  We called the hotel.  No one answered.  Called again, and someone hung up without answering.  Called again and someone answered.  We explained our predicament.  The staff asked about us looking for a tall guy.  Again, around the ring of ~30 folks standing there with mostly poorly visible handwritten signs to transport others, and no one there.  Back and forth, more phone calls, and the hotel staff eventually called his guy who allegedly said he was “on his way” and  allegedly “5 minutes away.”  It’s now ~01:45 AM early on a Sunday and about 1.5 hours since we started looking for someone. 15-30 minutes later, and no driver.  Finally, a guy shows up.  We think well, things happen and we proceed thinking this was a one-off to forget about.  So, we try to check in.  Lo, our prior explicit written and documented requests for a suite with a balcony all were ignored and then refused at the front desk.  We had to take what we could get.  A room at ~02:45AM.  Again, we think we’ll be ok, and things will work out.

Up to our room, a beautiful suite room.  Lots of granite in the bathroom etc.  it’s now of course late, yet we note the obviousness of considerable noise/music thumping away outside easily audible in the room.  Some sort of restaurant/outdoor venue, and our room has 2 different walls and 3 sets of windows facing this venue.  We were so exhausted that we fell asleep any ways and the thumping stopped about 03:00 AM.  The next night, a Sunday, we now have the same treatment with intrusive noise into the night.  So, Monday AM, we ask the front staff about it, and they implied it was unusual and describe it as a “birthday party” that prior night.  Knowing that we are planning to be at this hotel 5 more nights, we still ask to be moved to another room on the opposite side not facing this music venue.  We are told that they would do that.  My wife stayed in the room and went back and forth to/from the lobby for the entire day, repeatedly checking with the concierge and front desk staff on the status, and who were invariably reassuring.  So, by ~18:00, it was becoming beyond weird that the request was not accommodated.  I came back from a conference, and went to the desk, the staff had changed over, and they allegedly called the prior staff by phone while I was there, and then told me that there were No rooms open, and we would not be moved.  So, down the sewer went one entire day of vacation in Marrakech for my wife while I was at a conference/meeting.  We got a bit lucky in that that Monday PM, the room was tolerable, as the venue was not as noisy.

Lo, on to Tuesday. We again asked to be moved because we were sure by the weekend, our luck would run out.  Back and forth again.  I asked about upgrading to a larger room, or downgrading our room, including we’d gladly pay a different rate.  Eventually, the answer was no, we would not be moved.  At one point in all this, I asked whether anyone in the hotel had checked out, as surely these answers were making no sense that there was 0% room turnover. The answer was “no”, although we could trip over some luggage in the lobby of others if not careful.  Well, the “weekend” came a bit fast that Tuesday night. 

Tuesday PM, the noise started up by about 21:30PM and then ~22-22:30PM it became even Louder than it was on Saturday PM.  By this point, with the completely unreliable responses from about 8 different reception and concierge staff above over 2 days of queries, with the music volume going up in decibels by the hour, we felt we had no choice but to make a reservation by about 23:00 PM that night to move to another hotel the next day.  

We eventually figured out that the noisy perpetrators are actually the Sofitel itself, and it is from the So Lounge. Still, the unwillingness to move a couple to another room when their plans were for 7-night’s stay is intolerable.  This is our worst rating ever out of hundreds given over the years, including another 300+ from another TripAdvisor account we had. 

Key question, would we overlook the noise etc. and stay here again because of the breakfast, other amenities?  No, we would definitely not. Visitors who are late night partiers may completely disagree with us and find this 3AM noisy room/party atmosphere to be exactly what they want.  Otherwise, buyer beware if you end up stuck on that side of the hotel for $500 a night.

Solution(s) for management:  1) turn down the volume at the lounge and/or 2) put in top notch multi-pane windows similar to those at the Frankfurt airport and elsewhere that cannot be opened and thoroughly seal the windows as that should help. Solution for others considering staying at this sofitel:  not sure what to recommend, as insistence on where you have a room may be futile (see above)."
"Somehow, this property does not live up to expectations. 

Let's make it short - The only bright spot is the breakfast. Excellent and plentiful, that is if you show up before 9am, at which point it becomes a zoo.

If you are an Accor All member, you might as well go elsewhere, as there is zero recognition, zero upgrades and zero perks. Being Doamond I was very surprised.

The pool restaurant has the worst service of all. Food is overpriced and not good. You have to beg foe someone to take you order.

Room service is quite quick. Warning, they charge for coffee pods.

Housekeeping is a joke and I had to call five times for a couple of towels until I stepped out and found some on a cart.

Our room was not a suite despite being called one. It was a long room ending in a small balcony. Every evening there was a lot of noise from a band playing by the pool or some conference event.

Summary - not good at all. Poor value. Crappy ""suites"". Good breakfast."
"Public areas well designed and laid out - very photogenic!
Staff throughout hotel are unhelpful and lack any interest, charm or in some instances any politeness.  This is especially true around the pool or as we call it the 'the ask 3 times area'.  On first arrival it is unclear how the pool area works.  There are no staff explaining where or how to secure towels or how the poolbar restaurant works.  It actually uses a QR code which links you to an unhelpful app which does not always load on the patchy hotel wifi.  Most of the pool staff are gathered around in groups of 3 talking to each other and studiously avoiding any eye contact with customers presumably for fear they may have to do something. They are herded by men in blue suits who throw their arms around and achieve nothing other than confusing the already reluctant staff.  One day we ate at the pool restaurant.  Walked up to table area and stood for several minutes as staff worked around us but did not acknowledge our presence or ask if we wanted a table.  Eventually we sat - another 25 mins before anyone came to the table - another 35 mins before our food arrived.  You really just have to keep asking if you want any service.  On another occasion we ordered some tapas - after an hour we tracked down a waiter and asked when the order might turn up.  He checked.  That menu not available during the day (not that the QR/website says that) his colleague was new and should not have taken the order - even though no one had bothered to come and tell us the order was not being progressed.
The standard of food at the pool bar was average and the menu not that exciting (if only they did tapas at lunch!) Breakfast food choice more impressive and a shout out to the omelette chef - the only smiling staff member we met in a whole week (not joking!).  We didn't eat dinner in the hotel firstly as we were not at all sure where this was but we think there was only a buffet option and secondly the lack of service made us look elsewhere - so glad we did.  Had super food and service across the road in the Nobu restaurant and sky bar as well as other places.
Used the Sofitel spa for a Hamman which was ok but again the service with a smile was lacking and a towel might have been nice.
Our room was comfortable and the bed very comfortable.  Housekeeping could have consistently topped up tea/coffee etc - some days they did some days not - mystery.
All reviews are personal and based on expectation vs delivery.  That is the power of a brand - you supposedly know what to expect.  We have stayed in several other Sofitel's both in Morocco and in other countries.  All are far better than this one.  We will not risk another Sofitel.  A head office emergency team should be sent to Marrakech to fix the service in this hotel before too many customers realise the issues.  It is leaking potential revenue by its terrible service - guests are eating and drinking elsewhere.  We spoke to other guests who felt the same as us."
"A tired hotel in a good location. The staff seemed disinterested when any negative comments were made. A few key front line staff were rude and didn't seem to care about the service they offer.  The hotel looked tired and run down and the staff gave the impression they were not very happy. main issues were:

1. We paid over £300 for an 8am check-in and 6pm check-out - which was not honoured.  11.30 check-in and 4pm check-out.
2. Pool attendants cleared away towels with items on them each day whilst we were at lunch.  Couldn't get a lounger after that.  This happened every day!
3. Only 2 restaurants were open. Buffet which was £60 per head excluding drinks.  Food was cold and dry and no English translation as to what the food was. The So bar only offered suchi as it was a reduced menu due to Ramadan. 
Would recommend Nohu rooftop restaurant over the road. Amazing service, great ambiance and superb food. They appreciate the business .
4. The pool service was dreadful.  Huge delays and mistakes made with each order. Not one smile or apology.  Why wouldn't you tain front of house to be more customer friendly.

We were a family of 5 and for a real treat I booked a presidential suite and a luxury suite.  We were so excited to stay at the luxury brand Sofitel for a long weekend in Marrakech but sadly felt let down.  Apparently we were given a butler for the duration of our stay but didnt actually meet her until we left.  When I explained the issues she seemed disinterested.  
As the service was so awful i suggested removing the 5% service charge, but was swiftly told its non negotiable as its part of the price.  
Its a real shame that sofitel put their name to this hotel.  I am top tier status at a number of chains but would not consider moving my loyalty to them on the basis  of this experience.  It would have been so easy to have some empathy and make amends with an apology or discount for such a bad service but sadly it was not to be."
"Apologies Sofitel for the bad review but you need to make sure you sort the AGGRESSIVE abusive illegal parking attendant outside the hotel. I arrived with my girlfriend, we enjoyed your premises, we had a drink. Leaving we have been literally harassed by an abusive parking attendant which stood in front of the car and didn’t make us move, we wanted to call the Police but thankfully paying a high amount of money we managed to escape. You should offer security to your customer and I will never come back to Marrakech as abusive parking attendants are everywhere and extremely aggressive."
"They stole our jewellerys !!
We went to this hotel for 1 week as a family spent almost 4000£ just for the hotel which btw has only breakfaat included nothing else! Also be careful when going to this hotel as they may steal your jewellerys!  But we saw the photos and the reviews and since we are also content creators we decided to go here .when we went there the umbrellas of the swiming pool as shown on the advertisment were completley different colour and not vibrant at all! most of the images as shown on the website were not in reality ... the hotel said “we are under construction “ and we have removed lots of things.. ! But they still charging a lot for that hotel! there was dirt all over the pool since the constructions were continued during the day with loud noises as all the guests were relaxing on the kids swimming pool instead of the main swimming pool as that one was super cold and the kids one was heated and was overloaded with people! Anyway service at the swimming pool was so slow and no one paid attention at all! Every time we ordered something would come 2h later! the staff everywhere were careless..! The only people who were doing a good job were the ones holding the entrace doors.. It felt like 3 star hotel not 5* at all!! No entertainments like on other resorts or holidays where hotels keep their gusts entertained this hotel had nothing! Not even music played on the background on swimming pool or anywhere only silence and we were hearing construction all the time! We also travel around the world all the time and visited the best hotels and always was really good. None of our stuff were ever stolen! Anyway besides all this bad experience we also got stolen on our room lots of gold jewellerys!! we were so sad and we told the manager about it! Most of those things were engagement gifts! She suggested to go to the police station and report it as we did! I spent the day reporting at the police station and they came to investigate at the hotel.. But none of the staff were actually doing much about it… we let that go although the amount of the jewellery they stole was 3000£ and we were trying to enjoy our last days from our holiday and leave that to the police to investigate..! The jewellery was not found and we came back home very disappointed from this holiday! Definitely never going back there or would not recommend this hotel!"
"I am really upset that I have been charged 70 Dirhams for milk so that I can make English tea in my room. I used 5% of the glass of milk, I might take it back home with me now because of price of milk.this should be free of charge for all customers, especially when you are staying in the presidential suite (room 405) for £700 a night. It’s just wrong,"
"Hotel has a modern and traditional part. We stayed in a suite in the modern part facing the Atlas mountain and pool. Hotel charges extra fee for certain Spa areas. Room size is ok with basic furniture and equipment. Check-in took an hour and WiFi did not work. Staff does not pay attention to details. They did not notice that the arrival day was my birthday. Never again - much better places in town."
"Not a good hotel for a group - in fact very poor. They took the best part of an hour to check in my group of 15 people (in contrast, the Sofitel in Rabat did it in a couple of minutes), and their rooms were scattered all over this very large property. Several of the group had complaints - room service wanting cash payment immediately, an excessive 1000 dirham credit card deposit etc - and the management and desk staff seemed arrogant and unconcerned. Only the porters seemed to be on top of things. Never again."
"I have to say that I never thought I would write a review like this and that I would feel so unsafe in a hotel from the staff that work there. I have chosen to write this review only once I’m home safe.
We arrived at the hotel quite early (12.30pm) and asked about the possibility of an early check-in and were told that this might be possible but that our room wasn’t ready. We didn’t hear from them so we made our way back to reception at 3pm after having lunch by the pool and a swim. The receptionist seemed instantly angry and said “it’s our discretion as to when you can check-in and you’ve been told your room isn’t ready”. We said that we’d been told this over two and a half hours earlier and our booking stated that check-in was from 3. She said “well your room isn’t ready you’ll have to wait 10 minutes”. This wasn’t ideal as we were all in swimgear including my disabled son and the reception was busy. After 10 minutes we asked someone else what the problem was and were told “be patient it will be ready when it’s ready”. It was really embarrassing sat in reception in very little clothing and my young daughter found it especially humiliating as people were staring.
After 25 minutes a male receptionist slid the key to us and said “it’s ready” and didn’t bother to tell us how to get to the room so we wondered around looking for a lift.
When we got to the room we unpacked and settled the kids. I went to make a tea when I noticed the teaspoons were filthy. This made me look closer and I noticed the carpet looked filthy too. As did the coffee table, the desk, the bathroom floor, the sinks, everything! It became obvious that our room had been tidied but not cleaned. I took pictures as it was so shocking. When we spoke to housekeeping they sent us a hoover and a damp cloth to clean it ourselves, so we did.
I’d been in the room a couple of hours when I kept thinking that things didn’t seem right with the room, I’d booked a suite with a separate sleeping area for the kids, a bath for my disabled son and lots of other amenities that didn’t seem to be there. My partner when to reception and luckily spoke to someone lovely who didn’t seem to hate us. She explained that we hadn’t been given the suite we’d booked as the website had incorrectly mixed up the prestige and junior suites so we were told we could move to the suite we had booked if we wanted. So we packed up all our things and moved to the suite we’d booked you. You’ll see on the pictures of the filth that we’d been put in a junior suite which is really just a room.
The next morning I was on the loo when someone forced their way into the room with no warning, they saw me on the look and left very quickly. I called to ask why it had happened and they said it just does but the person should have announced themselves.
We bought some rugs and were having them delivered to the hotel and so went to reception to ask if they could receive them for us. The same people were there from the previous day. There were 6 people behind reception in total. We waited 10 minutes and eventually guest services said to one of the receptionists in Moroccan “Won’t somebody help them”? They all refused to speak to us. So guest services helped us instead.
We later called reception to check if the rugs had arrived and they kept calling my husband madam, which they did throughout our stay. He’s a 6 foot south Africa and it would be very difficult to confuse him for a woman.
I feel strongly that this was all done because we are a gay male couple. The treatment we received from the beginning was extraordinary. You can pick up on hatred and animosity and it came at us in waves from the entire reception staff.
Upon checking out, we expected problems and of course there were problems. They added about 400 pounds to the bill and when I showed them my booking confirmation and they price they just shrugged. Again, we managed to get someone from guest services to help us who was able to get them to accept they’d overcharged us. They did, however, refuse to give me a copy of the receipt despite the fact that I’d actually paid the incorrect, higher bill. I am waiting to see if this transaction is cancelled and I suspect it won’t be.
We messaged accor during our stay to alert them of what was happening to us and they ignored my messages. We tried to cancel the room and stay elsewhere as we felt increasingly unsafe and were told we could not cancel the room unless we paid the full price.
I’m sure the hotel will deny all of this or say that they’ll investigate. They’ll deny the wrong room but you can jump online and see if for yourself, they still have the wrong description so you won’t get what pay for. They’ll deny homophobia and calling my husband madam and smirking and being rude to us, they have to, it was so unprofessional and intimidating.
My advice is if you are gay or in anyway different then book this hotel with extreme caution. I’ll never know why they barged into my room the way they did but given the abuse that was happening then I don’t think it’s unusual that we all felt afraid.
I’m a gold accor member now and I can’t see me staying in their hotels again after this, I gave them a chance to help and they ignored us."
"Overall, this began well we arrived early and they were super accomdating in getting us a room on early check-in without any extra cost.  Staff generally lovely / polite smiley and helpful.  Breakfast was awsome.  So Lounge, was our fav chill location post 7:30pm.  It all went teribbly wrong for us in out final few hours.  We checked out in sufficient and settled the account (even though it was no explained with clarity) £350, time to allowance to have breakfast and the drive to the airport for out flight.  However as we about to get into the cab, the doormen staff told us reception wanted a word with us.  We were spoken to like schoolc children being reprimanded, telling us are we are aware we took half board and we were only allowed to choose between a lunch or dinner option each day ( which we know, understood and adhered too) however we were told we have double used this option on one day yo yhe amount of 200 pounds, we explained this is not possible for numerous reasons, however the man was instance.  He could see were in duress, as we were getting late to leave for our flight.  We paid, just to exit on time and not miss our flight.  Just as well as the earthquake struck that very evening.  Bottom line, try not to book half board and pay as you go for your own sanity.    Take an Iron as well. Staff generally are a bit weak in english, so brush up on your French."
"Mismanaged room situation, no clarity on smoking or non smoking since our room (which was supposed to be cleaned “WREAKED“ of smoke)

Also waiting hours for checking in (with just one person working the desk while 4 other people were standing around saying they can’t help) 

the food and pool are the main redeeming qualities of this hotel"
"This is my first ever negative review of a hotel ever.
We have never experienced a bad stay in any of our travels so far but this one I felt I had to mention as it was a huge let down of our trip to Marakesh.

We stayed at Sofitel lounge and spa Marakesh in August with our kids and found the reception staff very rude.
My husband asked for water for my son at the reception and was told rudely to buy water from the bar.
Which 5* hotel does not provide water for guests in the lobby area?
So my husband went upto our room and got a bottle of water for our son.
Even if they do not provide water it would have been nice for the reception staff as a one off to get us some water out of courtesy as a gesture of looking after their guests.

Then the night before we checked out my husband payed our room bill so we would could have a hassle free morning, we were over charged for room service which they claimed we had ordered that same night which we initially thought may have been our son as he was in the room whilst we were downstairs, so we continued to pay the bill.
When we came upstairs our son mentioned that he did not order anything.
When we approached them the next morning they realised it was their error but refused to give us a refund and told us that we would be discounted on our next stay, we told them that there was not gonna be a future stay as the service we received was awful, so he finally agreed to give the refund but did not give us the entire sum. It was about £20 short, the point was not about the £20 but the fact that we were not treated with respect and had to demand a refund and that too we were not reimbursed the full amount when it was clearly an error from their side.
Despicable service from the reception staff.

The rest of the staff were amazing, especially the poolside staff the door keepers and welcome staff were excellent, concierge was amazing with hotel recommendations and made us feel so welcome.

The hotel is beautiful but some of the rooms are extremely outdated old and dirty. 
We booked a suite but were given a room which looked nothing like the pictures of the suite we had seen on their website before we booked.
The manager we spoke to she was lovely and gave us the room we actually booked.

It was mainly the reception staff.
We were not made to feel comfortable at all. We felt they were very unapproachable if we needed to discuss any issue.
We will not be returning to Sofitel Marakesh in the future."
"I have going to Sofitel since 8 years and I could not believe the terrible experience with had me and my son.
It used to be a Lovely hotel with great service but I must admit that the level of service has changed a lot! This is definitely not a 5 star level of service!

I booked a Junior Suite 6 weeks in advance and specifically requested a beautiful view on the garden and Swimming pool so I can check my son.

Instead we had a junior suite very dark, I felt in a cave with view on a concrete roof of the parking. I mediately requested another room.

We arrived at 5.30 pm after a long plane journey and my son was looking forward to jump in the pool. Instead it took
2 hours and half to check in to finally placed us in a decent room they charged us 1,500 Dirham extra per night!

We were there to relax on holiday but instead we had the laundry service knocking at our door and stepped in directly inside our room without our permission at 8am! And to make sure we were not going back to relax then they called at 8.15 am to explain why they entered our room without permission!
This happened also in the evening when I showered before getting ready for dinner and I heard voices in my room. It was the room service checking from inside my room if I needed something !

And just to wrapped up the quality of service: I made sure our luggage and taxi from the hotel (which is 3 times the price of a normal taxi so you would expect high service.) were ready exactly at 4.45 pm to take us to the airport. However nothing was ready and I had to chase everybody around to ensure we were not late. Taxi and luggage finally arrive 20 mins after chasing the car service from the hotel.

Also they had so many corporate events with big groups and I did not feel right to have breakfast with my shorts or  pool dress while everybody was wearing suits and talking business.
The hotel remain beautiful but this whole experience has been stressful and definitely not enjoyable.

I would strongly recommend to try another hotel in Marrakech."
"I was supposed to stay at the Sofitel Marrakech for my birthday. I arrived the day of my birthday after 7 hours of travel to learn that my reservation had been cancelled. I received no notification of this cancellation and I was left stranded. After around 2 hours I found a hotel far outside of the city to stay for the night. If you’re traveling to Morocco, I’d recommend finding a different hotel. Apparently reservations mean nothing here. 

I think it’s also worth noting that I am gay and felt the need to jump through extra hoops when finding new accommodations, as it is illegal to be gay in Morocco and I was leaning on the safety and comfortability I have with the Sofitel brand. I chose poorly."
"If you are a Muslim or accept reasonable modesty at the swimming pool then this hotel is unsuitable. It is not geared for families with children as this hotel allows nudity and topless sunbathing. Women openly walk around with their breasts hanging out. I asked a waiter serving lunch whether this was acceptable and he informed me everything was acceptable at this hotel. Shocking as I had expected some level of modesty as Morocco is a Muslim country. This would not be allowed at the Four Seasons. Disgusting to see whilst having lunch by the pool. Even in swimming pools in England this would not be acceptable. Anyway  my husband and I stayed at this hotel for 5 nights. Spacious rooms with beautiful views overlooking the pool and gardens. Staff not overly friendly and warm but not rude either. Hotel caters for mostly French customers and very little English spoken and understood on the grounds. Limited menu at breakfast. Got a late check out. This hotel should advertise it is mainly for adults and allows nudity near pool areas"
"Starting with the positives, reception staff friendly and welcoming, cold towels and moroccan tea on arrival, the hotel itself is beautiful, clean and impressive communal areas, stunning pool and gardens with comfy sun beds and 10-15 minute walk to main square. 
The food (lunch) is nice and fresh, cooked breakfast not great but lots of other really nice breakfast options like pastries, fresh juice, sushi/salmon, fruit etc. 

On the down side…. 
* Drinks are VERY expensive, 100/110 dirham (£9) for a bottle of beer, same for a large bottle of water and 60 dirham (£5) a can of coke. 70 dirham (£6) for small bottle of water that costs 5 dirham in town. I get you pay a premium in upmarket hotels but 12 times the price is excessive! 
* Slow service; prepare to wait a long time to be served when busy. Our worse experience by the pool was 2 hours and 5 reminders to the waiter in order to get a can of coke but we regularly waited 20-30 minutes for drinks to arrive. 
* Other than reception staff, we generally found a lot of staff to be quite rude, it felt we were inconveniencing the breakfast staff to ask for a coffee, the pool side waiting staff regularly fobbed us off when we asked for things, a number of times part of our order never arrived then receipts were rushed into our hands to sign it to our rooms then they became aggressive and confrontational when we we challenged items on the receipt that never arrived. A barman/waiter at So Lounge came over to me twice asking for a tip which i refused as the service has been poor. 
* Housekeeping were ok, a couple of times they only turned down one of our twin beds and forgot to leave water in our rooms. I also think they should implement what many hotels do whereby you leave towels on the floor to be replaced and they leave those hung up your happy to use again. 2 of us were showering twice a day for 3 days and they replaced towels that were hung up each morning/evening so we got through 12 towels over 3 days which was excessive and not great for the environment. 

So overall a nice hotel in a good location with quality food but room for improvement with customer service, speed of service and prepare for too whack prices."
"Very appealing property.  The service was slow and indifferent.  Shower was oscillating between hot and cold mostly cold.  Very noisy until 11 pm.  Food was average at best.  Having stayed at fairmont properties this is more like a holiday inn express in comparison.  Sofitel as a brand is off my list for future stays."
"We paid €500 per night for 2 nights which is quite expensive but this is supposed to be a top hotel. Very impressive building.  We had a room at the back of the hotel on a noisy road with no decent view. After a long drive looking forward to  a shower, as my wife showered the water flooded in to the toilet & bedroom,  called reception & asked for another room but were told no rooms available.  Workman came to unblock the drain and had to wait for housekeeping to mop up the mess which took time and delayed our evening. When returning after our evening there were many children screaming and shouting on the ground floor at 11pm which is unacceptable.  Next day we had the same problem with the shower so gave up & had very short shower. They didn't replace tea, coffee,  sugar, mini bar next day, again unacceptable for supposed 5 star hotel. Sunbeds have bags and towels on early morning however a lot of them are not used meaning latecomers have no chance of using them, very selfish & needs to be addressed by management.  All this meant we did not have a good stay despite paying  a lot of money!"
"After looking forward to a day pool pass and being quoted 600 dirams at Sofitel 2 days prior, we arrived to be told a pass was now 150euros! Then it was reduced to 100euros! We didn’t stay and went to El Saadi next door with 3 course lunch for 600 dirams! Shame on you Sofitel"
"In my experience, I found that the Sofitel hotel in Marrakesh was not a good value for money when it comes to using their pool. They charged a fee of 100 euros per person just to enter the hotel and access its amenities, which I believe is an exorbitant amount. Moreover, I noticed that the prices seemed to be higher for Western guests, which is unfair and can leave a bad impression on visitors.

Overall, I was disappointed with the service provided by the Sofitel hotel in Marrakesh, and I do not recommend it to other travelers who are looking use their facilities."
"U promote a Spectacular Sunday Brunch all over the internet and your own website but it doesnt exist.  We had planned to celebrate a very special occasion at the brunch but were laughed at by reception.  Ohh brunch we havnt done that since b4 covid.   We are like are u sure look here are all the links.  We even booked.  More laughs no no no.  We dont do brunch. Try somewhere else."
"I booked a tour through the concierge at the hotel lobby.  He seems ambitious and knowledgeable.  He told me the private tour for Marrakesh is a wonderful choice.  With Sofitel brand, you put such trust in them, so decide to do this.  Starting by concierge asking for all cash payment, I paid him $150 Euros.  He promised me with private driver, and private guide, it gonna to be great tour with focus on history buildings ( I told him I am an architect). 

The day of the tour starts at 10 AM, they starts to drive me around neighborhoods outside of the Medina old town, later on I realize this just to kill time and demonstrate the car is “useful”.  So the guide took me briefly visited  the Dar el Bacha, then ask me either need to visit Ibn Youssel school, I told him, you are the guide, he said it is very similar to Dar el Bacha. I persisted to visit it.  It turns out it is unique and not “similar”.  The guide shows no interest to do his job as guide rather passing the time and get rid of this duty. After this he took me to the carpet shop, furniture shop, and oil shop, even after I told him I am NOT interested in shopping.  It was totally waste of time.  I told the concierge that I am architect and solely interested in buildings and history culture, it doesn’t seem the guide gets the message.  After passing the market, the final stop was the Saadien Tomb.  I asked him if there anything else after this. He said nothing.  I was surprised that the city has such little to see.  But later on it proves wrong, the city has way much to see, such as the palaces and many other places.  We barely used the driver and car, and the guide showed me only three landmarks, plus his planned shopping which I told him at beginning I am NOT interested to do.  All this for $ 150 EUROS?  I have to call it a total rape off, and surprisingly enough it was from Sofitel concierge recommendation.  It is a shame for such international brand, as customer in a new place, you put all the trust in them, it is quite an unfortunate.  I will never stay with this brand again."
"Even before arriving it seems hard to find a right email address to contact the hotel about our booking. Sent a message via email days ago (unless wrong email although on this page) no reply. Even a DM via Twitter no reply. Doesn’t seem good for a five star hotel. Disappointing!"
"This is the worst hotel ever. Our reservation for the room was suppossed to be a prestige one. The room could not be checked in. They never cared for our waiting, not even told us to come back in a few hours. The luggages were not brought up. The safe in the room not working, we told three times but no one cared to come and fixit. no one gets the calls at the reception. There is no information in the room. The room is 10 minutes walk to reception and I went three times just to get the QR code. I will make a complaint to Accor"
"An absolutely filthy hotel.  I was given a filthy hotel room with mold all around the bathroom, dirt on the walls, various liquid stains on the ground, and stains on the bed.

There was constant dragging noise from the upstairs neighbour all night, like someone was dragging a couch or chair across a wooden floor.  I found it really hard to sleep.

The staff's attitude was horrible.  Staff were so unfriendly.  

On check out, they accused me of taking something from the minibar.  I told them I didn't, as I hadn't.  They kept asking me, and asked me to sign a CONTRACT saying that I didn't use anything from the minibar.  A horrible experience."
"I stayed at Sofitel Marrakech the first time around five years ago, and had some very fond memories, that’s why before booking this time, I was somewhat surprised to see the average and negative reviews. 
Facilities: The facilities (pool lobby etc) are nice but the rooms need updates. No kettle, no nespresso machine, no brochure to figure out how to call the reception etc. tried room service and the food was poor / very basic. Breakfast: the hotel is huge so the breakfast is like a canteen with stuff rushing around, no smiles. The food selection is ok.
Other: Had a blow dry done at the spa as well. While the result was ok, the spa is extremely dated and dark. The hairdresser didn’t speak English and was absolutely not motivated to be there. 
Checkout: had to wait for 10 minutes to check out with only one person ahead of me and one staff member checking out. She clearly could have called another member of staff to help or send me to another reception but she was just not bothered. This was at peak checkout time at 12. Again, poor service and disappointed. Sofitel, please train the staff properly if you want to call this hotel a five star. "
"The hotel fails its 5 star status on several accounts.

We arrived at the hotel around 11AM, securing a booking for the previous day. Upon arrival, we found out that we didn’t have a room ready. Our room was finally ready around 2:30PM, by which point we were completely exhausted and tired of hanging out around the lobby and waiting for our too to be ready. The room that was provided to us was absolutely dirty (bathrooms were completely unclean and had several stains on and around the toilet bowl and the floors) and the room wasn’t what we paid for (we paid for a king room with a garden view only to get a double bed room with the view of the outer wall). It took an additional hour + to switch rooms.

Another oddity is the fact that the minibar check walked into our rooms at the most random and oddest times unannounced. Upon checking out, we were assessed $180 for minibar items that we never purchased. The issues took several minutes to resolve at the reception.

On the second day during my stay, I asked the concierge about getting train tickets to visit Fes and inquired if there’s an online method to purchase. The Concierge informed me that there’s no such me thing and that he’ll send a valet over to the train station to buy my tickets and all I had to do was give him 800 dirham (taxi back and forth for valet + train tickets). I later found out that I was exorbitantly overcharged - two train tickets to Fes cost no more that 300 dirham and there was a method to purchase tickets online. It doesn’t feel good to be hustled and duped by the concierge in this fashion at all! 

Lastly, nearly $1100 worth of items were stolen from us during our stay. I’ve contacted the hotel several times and not received a single response back.

Beware when staying here. There’s much to be improved in the hotel’s overall guest experience"
"since there is this platform to say our  opinion, well I want to state how shameless and disappointed your service was, especially from a guy there, there is no respect, no welcome at all i would like you to change this kind of employees cus they are making this hotel's reputation one of the worse hotels in morocco"
"Visitors with non-local credit cards should be aware that the hotel now automatically charges you in foreign currency, but for a 3.5% markup. They do not ask like any other merchant would. In the current era where travelers often have no foreign currency fee cards, it’s an unpleasant surprise. Staff informed me that the automatic conversion without asking the customer what currency to pay in is policy.

I stayed here twice recently, and rarely post negative reviews, but this otherwise acceptable hotel had too many basic, fixable issues. Staff and managers do nothing to actually fix problems, but will dig the hole deeper and leave you frustrated.

Also prepare to either spend time confirming billed amounts are correct, or just not mind being overcharged. Value of a guest’s time seemed a foreign concept, whether when resolving issues or just waiting for something like a drink by the pool.

The hotel otherwise is acceptable, with clean, spacious rooms that work for multi-day stays and a very large pool. The gym is what international travelers would expect at a 3-star, but might get one by. Housekeeping are very attentive if you go to them directly, but seemed not connected to the desk.

This hotel could deserve 5 star reviews, but especially for a place operating under an international brand, has a lot of work to do to be competitive. I would think twice before staying here again or recommending it to anyone else."
"I really do not like writing bad reviews, especially as many of the staff seemed to be ok people. But it really is difficult to express just how bad the service was during my stay. We arrived at 2:00 pm 4 June and were asked to wait until 3 pm. Fair enough, we went to the lobby waiting for the room. Service was horribly slow no welcome drink or tea. We got our room at 4:00 pm. I had requested a twin because I was with my mother. Unfortunately, the easy answer is we are fully booked and we don’t have rooms. 
I had requested a rollaway bed which was not set up when I went out to dinner at 8 pm. I reminded them. When I got back at 11 pm it was still not set up. I called them again and was promised: ""within 10 minutes"". A bed arrived very late. 
The breakfast was a good professional staff and smiling during the service when I’m back from my breakfast I found out that my rollaway bed is gone. really, I fell myself in a tent, not 5 Start Hotel. 
After c/out I got my car from the valley was damage, when I asked the staff, they told me to go to fix it and we will pay you, what amazing service at 5* Hotel?????
I spend my money to get my Hight bled pressure during the weekend."
"We decided to book the sofitel after reading the reviews.

The first thing when we arrived was we were not offered any drinks or refreshments however people arriving at the same time as us were offered these. 

We had booked three rooms for our holiday. Upon arrival they were trying to put myself in a connecting room to my parents who were celebrating their anniversary. The receptionist was very rude and stated that we could have the door locked for the duration of my stay. If I wanted to have a connecting room to my parents I would have booked that or stated it in the special requests. 

Check in was meant to be at 15:00 yet one of the three rooms was not available till 16:30 and even then the housekeeping was coming into the room to put towels and water bottles.

On the morning of the next day myself and my sister in law woke up to none of the bathroom lights working in both rooms. We tried to phone reception through the phone provided in the rooms and they were not picking up. Upon which I came downstairs and spoke to the gentlemen at reception who informed me the technician would not be available until 9am when he starts work the time at the moment in question was 8am. So I was expected to have showers in the dark. I had to request the gentlemen at reception to have someone come to my room to check the lights before then to which the guy who came said the lights ""had to be charged"". We complained to the hotel manager Marianne about this and she did provide us with 4 spa massages as a good will gesture. There was five of us on the holiday.

During out 6 day stay majority of the time was spent at reception trying to sort out rhe various problems we were facing. Please bare in mind if booking this place you will face ridiculously long queues at reception and even when you manage to speak to someone they will be beyond rude. 

Within the hotel there are four lifts half of which do not work. The doors within the lift do not open if there is a presence at the door so if being crushed by lift doors is what you want from a holiday then this is the place for you. 

On the last day of our holiday our flight was at 10pm so we spoke to the hotel assistant manager the evening before whose name was Mariamme to ask if we could have our lunch on day of departure included within our half board. As we had not spent anywhere near our allowance during any of the days we were staying there  She said that was fine. The morning on day of departure we had a conversation with her within which she stated that she had told the L'oasis resturant that we would be having lunch within our half board. 

When it got to lunchtime we went to the L'oasis restaurant. Every single day this is the location we had lunch as within our hotel deal we had a half board offer. Bare in mind if you go for the half board deal with this hotel you do not get any drinks included within the allowance you get. Not even water so be prepared to pay for all beverages despite paying very large amount for the hotel stay.

Every day the service within the L'oasis bar was slow and delayed we would have to request every thing twice if not more times before it arrived. On the last day as they believed we were paying customers the service provided was quick, efficient and very sweet. Abdelulah the resturant manager in particular changed over the level of service provided on the last day.

After our last lunch abdelulah told us to come with him to reception as it turnt out our lunch on day of departure was not included. The manager we had spoken to in order to confirm our lunch was included within the half board offer had left due to sickness. However when we messaged the number she gave us she replied back saying she was in meetings all day. We spoke to multiple members at reception including sukena and imen who all said that it was a misunderstanding that the manager said our lunch was included and forced us to pay for the bill as otherwise they would automatically debit the card we provided them during check in. Why we had to pay for lunch despite there being a misunderstanding on the manager part is unbelievable especially as we never used the full allowance on any of the days. 

If you are booking the hotel due to the infinity pool the pool will not be ready until September due to some brick work problems which was another misleading advertisement on their website. The main reason for why we booked this hotel was due to the infinity pool upon arrival we were told that it was out of bounds. 

On checkout they were trying to charge us for drinks out of the mini bar when we have not drank any of the drinks within the mini bar. We would walk over to Carrefour the supermarket 10min away and buy our drinks from the day. Despite this they charged us for mini bar drinks even after persistently saying we had not drank any of the bottles or drinks within the bar. The hotel staff members were so rude and abnoxious I have never experienced coming to a 5 star hotel and having to pay for drinks that we have not used. 

Overall if you prefer your holiday to be spent in the hotel reception speaking to unhelpful and extremely rude receptionists. Who all stand in a line speaking about you and the issues you are facing instead of helping. With lifts and facilities which do not work. Along with restaurants which offer very limited vegetarian options then this is the hotel for you.

If you would actually like to receive the 5 star service you have paid for then this is not the hotel for you.  If I could offer them less stars than a 1 I would as this hotel has completly ruined our holiday."
"This place is supposed to be 5 star !!!! Pay £120 for the day to use the pool and this is how they keep the place over run with cockroaches !!!!!!!! Do not go here it’s an absolute rip off !!! Drinks are expensive and the food is cold and just about bearable !!!! Never again would I visit this hotel and if you have any sense nor will you !!"
"Despite good reviews and (for Marrakech) quite good price indications, I cannot recommend Sofitel’s pool deal. It costs 60 € per person (!) and that does not include anything. Service is poor and food/drinks super expensive. Even half the price (online it says it is supposed to be 30€ per person) it would be too expensive."
"The hotel was nice and clean but the room was located very far from the entrance and reception area. There are two hotels together but due to works the entrance to the Imperial palace was through the Lounge & Spa which was a 5 minutes walk through the back garden and past the swimming pool. The lighting at night is very poor. When we asked to be moved the answer was no. We then asked to speak to the General manager or even a duty manager who failed to get back to us despite several requests through guest relations. Very poor customer service . The staff in the dining area Abdul Karim and Rashida were very helpful"
"The hotel obvious slogan is "" We don't care"".

Upon arrival to the hotel at 7:00pm the reception staff at turtle pace provided us with terrible disgusting rooms overlooking the hotel's Airconditioning compressors and claimed these were superior rooms? They are nothing but inferior rooms unfit for any guest.

We were it informed that the hotel was undergoing renovation and that we had to check in from a second side lobby? Any hotel that respects its guests should clearly state on their website and on all hotel search engines that renovation work was undergoing. The Sofitel did not even bother to leave an apology letter in the rooms to make up for the inconvenience their renovation has caused etc.

All group members complained that they cannot reach the reception or concierge or housekeeping or telephone operator from their rooms as all those departments simply DO NOT answer their phones.

If a guest staying at the Sofitel Marrakech is facing any kind of trouble or has a fire in their room - who cares?

We have stayed here brining several groups before but we certainly will never come here again.

"The check in @ 3 pm which is preposterous now the front desk ask wants to see the transaction for booking whether it was a valid transaction 😒 only because we were Indians rest of the Caucasians were not subjected to the similar treatment so much for “Live Limitless” when their heads are quite limited!"
"no vegetarian food only pizza at lunch by the pool time the  staff seem stressed no time for guests at all hotel restaurant the supper big tennis flood lights are blinding could not see the very boring menu so sad"
"We had two rooms booked for a work trip, check in was good and the rooms clean and tidy. 
Upon check in we both had the same issues, no air con working and also no power sockets were working. Reported it and was told to wait in the room, and someone would be there......after 3 hours, no one came so reported to reception again.

The power sockets were finally sorted late evening ( had to sit in reception to charge phones until sorted).

During our 4 day stay, the Air Con was never sorted in either room, was always told would be ""tomorrow"". Upon checkout was shrugged off when asked to speak to a manager to complain, and told to do it online as no manager onsite.

What was supposed to be a 5 star stay, ended up 3 star as had to sit in a public place to carry out private online meetings rather than privacy of air conditioned rooms!"
"I had an early morning flight and was told the Sofitel would be a nice place to stay for a night. Wrong! My room overlooked the pool, which had a bar/lounge blasting awful, bass-heavy pop music. When I requested a room change, I was told there was no such thing as a quiet room in the entire hotel. They all face the pool party. What a horrible design for a supposedly classy hotel! There are plenty of nice hotels in Marrakesh that somehow manage to have separate areas for fun and rest. DO NOT BOOK, unless you like sappy, thumping, pop music shaking your walls."
"This hotel is a real disappointment from the rude bartenders to the worn out furnitures in the hotel rooms. Add to that nosey staff and slow check in process.  I strongly suggest to stay a way from this hotel if you want to enjoy Marrakech."
"Awful service, came for lunch and the staff were so rude and could not wait to get rid of us. Kept disrupting us and the pool man on this date (19/03) was just terrible. 
Would never stay here and the lunch was so bland and the service just the worst in Morocco"
"We just stayed at Sofitel last night, and had a disappointing experience. 
We’re regular visitors to Marrakech and usually stay at other locations, but decided to join couple friends who booked here, and a lot of things went wrong, this is not the Sofitel I visited in the early 2010’s…
- service became really bad. Calling reception for 25 minutes without an answer, and being obliged to go down to ask for an iron, was some of the things we faced
- the legendary Sofitel top-bedding is definitely not there anymore, instead, a blanket in a pouch delivers a very average sleeping experience…
- reading here some people are happy with the view. Definitely not our case, with the 460->470 rooms facing an amazing double Parking space. Definitely not Marrakexh vibes. Be careful with the room you get, and if you’re nice like us and too lazy to complain, you’ll get a poor view room for sure…
- the kids club is a joke, don’t go with kids if you expect them to spend some time there or if they like kid’s clubs. They (4 and 8) both complained after 15mn about the lack of activities, the darkness of the place, and asked us to take them to the four seasons or fairmont ones, their favorite in Marrakech. Also, it closed too early at 16:00 on Saturday, while it’s supposed to close later 
- last but not least, someone from the hotel entered our rooms yesterday night while we weren’t there and while our kids were sleeping with their nanny, at 9:30pm, scared them, shortened our evening (we were out dining and came back as kids were crying), so basically made our date night out a complete failure…
Won’t step into this hotel again for sure, and don’t if you expect a quality experience, you’ve got much better options in the city"
"I want to encourage you to improve service according to hotel standards and your customer service!
A lot of electrical appliances did not work. When we called reception for help, we had to call multiple times in order for someone to actually come help us, even though they answered and said they’d come every time."
"I would like to make a complaint and am totally dissatisfied with my stay at the Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial.
We booked and paid for Luxury Rooms 
After emailing to say we would like to check in at 3pm we arrived at the hotel at 3.30pm to be told our rooms were not ready and to come back in half an hour.  We did this and was told again sorry it will be another half an hour until our rooms were ready and the hotel was very busy.  The hotel did not seem busy at all?
We had been up since 2am and were so tired.  We were pointed to the other side of the hotel and not taken to our rooms. Once we caught up on sleep and showered, we realised the room was not luxury.  There was a pile of cut pubic hair left of the ledge in the shower. The shower glass curtain did not contain the water and floor was flooded wetting all the towels.  There are only 4 coat hangers in the wardrobe, and you are only given 3 coffee sachets for 2 people. Trying to get more coffee was impossible.  The carpet was coming away from seam and there was all white cream/powder around the door handles.   The tiny balcony was so small you had to take turns to sit down on the chairs to both fit in to sit down.  I phoned reception for 30 minutes before giving up.  My daughter called them from her mobile and again no answer.  If there was any emergency, we would have not had any help at all. After complaining to reception they said they were dealing with an incident at that 1 hour we were trying to ring them.  The next morning we got moved to then main nicer side of the hotel in a better room, and given a bottle of bubbly ( we left it in the room as we do not drink alcohol) and some chocolates to apologise but again, in the morning on closer inspection the same again. Only 4 coat hangers for 2 people staying a week.  The tissue box cover was covered in thick dust. The telephone so was sticky and filthy I had to take a picture.  The carpet had so many stains on so to sit down next to the mirrored wardrobe to apply make-up we had to put a clean towel down on the floor.  This is totally not luxury or 5 star . 
Also having chose a spa hotel,  we wanted to book some treatments.  However on trying to contact the Spa reception you can never get anyone to answer the phone, so I went down to book treatments.  The spa opens at midday.  So midday I went down to the spa and was met by the PT gym man and he said they don’t open until 12.15pm so I said I would wait.  I wanted to wait by the main water feature, but he didn’t want me to sit there for some reason.  He also said do not go in the pool as it costs 500MAD  I said I was a guest at the hotel and he said yes I know   the indoor pool is not free!!  When the spa receptionist arrived she informed me there were not free appointments today and tomorrow only 1 appointment left at 4.30pm. which I couldn’t make.  No apology or anything.  To say this is a 5-star hotel is a lie. I have stayed in cleaner Premier inn rooms.  We paid a lot of money for a much-needed break and we were totally disappointed and feel as though we have been totally conned and overpaid for a basic unclean and dirty room. Please find attached photograph of evidence"
"First of all I booked a room in Sofitel the imperial Which is dearer than  lounge Sofitel and I’ve been given a room at Sofitel lounge and spa because the hotel was in renovation. Why do you let people book and overcharged them instead of just explaining the situation at the reception. 

Second thing, I was at the pool and I wanted To order a drink I had to wait for an hour and I’m not even exaggerating AN HOUR !! all the waiters were hiding in the shade at the pool bar and when you speak to them, it’s just like they’re doing you a favour. 

The hotel room is so outdated comparing to other 5 star hotels in Marrakesh

The only good thing About this hotel is the location and the hotel entry. Appart from them I would’ve gave it 1 star"
"Bad service is an understatement. Don’t be fooled by this hotels surprising reviews because it is just BAD. Bad service, Rude Staff who have not clue. Try ordering something and you get passed from one staff to the other because no one wants to do their job. It’s just a JOKE. STAFF DONT WANT TO WORK SO you pay for service but no one to give you service. It’s ridiculous. Staff are just waiting for tips and when you tip them that’s the end. No more service. The staff Farah - Who kept coughing and grunting at breakfast buffet. How disgusting. It’s better to go to the bathroom and grunt until you’re throat is clear than to do this for 1 hours at breakfast - especially during Covid season. This is common teaching that you don’t grunt continuously at food/restaurants. And when we informed her manager because it was obviously unappealing someone coughing out cataar when you are eat for over an hour, she gets upset and won’t serve us and won’t do her job. I mean honestly so your job. I’m not here to be your friend pleaSe do your job! The service at lunch by the pool is appalling. Staff keep passing the job to other staff and you end up getting no service. This hotel is to be avoided. The new bald head security guy is so rude. I mean I am your guest and a paying guest. I’m not here to be your buddy please do your job. Politeness is unheard of in this hotel. AVOID THIS HOTEL AT ALL COSTS"
"My partner and I have had a really bad customer service experience with this hotel particularly reception and the reservations team. I would not recommend staying at this hotel if you value anything even close to a five star service."
"Checked in today after a long journey and I'm regretting booking the hotel. The rooms are not in great condition for a five star hotel, carpet burn marks, and in general do not have the feel of a luxury hotel. They feel unclean and dusty and when you take into consideration the current climate - it makes you feel uneasy.

By booking one of the most renowned hotels in Marrakech you would expect much better quality. Not particularly looking forward to the next five days - may even consider moving to a different hotel.

There pictures presented in the site and the actual 2 rooms we are occupying do not look the same. It's difficult to get away in such testing times - and after a long journey, to say I'm dissatisfied is an understatement.

Naman"
"Arrived at mid-night with my wife and my 18 months baby, The balcony's table and couch were inside the room ( a total disaster ) Their was no water in the room at our arrival ( Only one used bottle in the dirty mini bar and another used bottle of sparkling water on the table). I asked for a cot for my baby, they could not provide it after an hour and a half ( being tired and with all what happened i asked them just to ignore it because the baby was already asleep). Last but not least, as i'am an accord frequent client i've used points to pay for my stay which they don't know how to handle. The points were deducted from my account at the time of booking. I was surprised at the check out with a totally different amount to pay, they did not take into consideration my points. At the end they rededucted the points from my account ( i ended up having the points deducted twice). They really need to reconsider that hotel being a 5 stars. It is a shame"
"Having booked to stay for 5 days from 30th March my trip was cancelled because of Covid.
However I have been waiting 3 weeks for a refund, no replies to my emails , nothing ....
Accor hotel - disgusting"
"We booked this hotel almost 8 months in advance l, only to arrive here and wait for hours in order to check in.
Don’t let yourself foooed by the beautiful pictures and reviews. Most of the things you see in the pictures are very deceiving.
First of all, the service is very slow. You ask the waiter for tea, he’ll tell to another waiter, and the other waiter will tell you another one, and so far and with everything else. By the time you get your tea, or whatever service you need, you might as well just go and make it yourself.
Second, the hot water in the shower is barely dripping. No pressure at all. Guess what, this is my third day at this hotel, we complained numerous times, talked to the manager of the manager’s manager (at least 3 managers, two of them called Hanna and Imam). All we got was: “Qui, madam”... and nothing else. Nothing was fixed.
Third, first night after trying to somehow to shower myself waiting for the hot water to make it to our focet, I realized there’s no hair dryer in the room. Called the reception and they sent us a hair dryer. When I plugged it in the shower socket it wasn’t working. Called the reception once, they said as always: “Qui, madam”. Waited for an hour, nobody came. Called again, the same story. For 2days in a row I called several times, went to reception talked to 2 managers, and until this day I cannot dry my hair. I had to dry my hair in the dark hall of the room, on the floor, since that was the only mirror and working socket in the room. At all my complaints, calls, requests, the management did absolutely NOTHING. They finally sent a guy to check out the socket. And here’s another interesting development. It seems the Sofitel Marakesh hotel showers are not exactly for women’s needs. The socket is the shower is only for men’s beard shaving machines use. NOT FOR HAIR DRYERS. Now, the funny part, when I asked where I’m supposed to dry my hair, I was told to go somewhere else. And use any other socket in the room. Once again, there’s only one mirror in the room, in the hall which is very dark even with the lights on and small. This is outrageous!! I have never seen or heard anything like this before. 
Fourth, the hotel has a beautiful pool, which is not heated. In fact, the water it’s so freezing, that nobody is getting into the pool. The pool is always empty. They do have a smaller heated pool for $50 a day per person. 
The bar and restaurant prices are ridiculously expensive. I would never recommend this hotel to anyone. Don’t waste your time and money, this hotel’s not worth it. 
There’s a construction going on in the building so prepare yourself for the noise and the dirt around."
"This is the worst hotel I’ve ever stayed at. 
Beautiful grounds and good facilities ruined by terrible service. 
Everything was unbelievably slow with multiple requests to get anything. From over an hour for a salad at lunch, to asking for tea 7 times at breakfast and took over 40 minutes before it arrived. Check in took well over 30 mins once they were ready for us and although some staff pleasant (but incompetent) others quite rude. 
Lift 3 block rooms are adjacent to a disco and are incredibly noisy late at night. Hotel would not allow us to change room following a sleepless night. Had to threaten to sleep in quiet hotel corridor before they moved my room. 
The only redeeming feature was the weather - the hotel staff couldn’t ruin that!"
"I arrived to a fantastic looking reception it all went down hill from here
There was a plain suite awaiting no elegance or luxury at all of which I had been promised I would receive due to it being the largest suite the hotel provided at a fairly high cost of £5500.00 for 2 adults 2 children for 7 days not a budget hotel cost by any standard no food provided which I knew but at such a cost I did expect a bit of luxury.
There was construction work going on through the day for 5 of the 7 days I was promised daily it was going to stop it didn’t. The room at night time was so noisy people above on tiles floors coming in at 3 till 5 in the morning not there fault but the noise was horrendous ,televisions so loud until at 3 in the morning I had to complain .There were men in suites constantly hanging around outside the bedrooms very weird to say the least.There were small items that went out of our room on a daily basis which only became apparent on the last couple of days glasses,children’s clothes ,children’s camera, all of which we put down to being misplaced then on the last day adult clothes went missing out of the room I went to reception and was basically told if it wasn’t at concierge it wasn’t there nothing that could be done 
I was fobbed off stole from and felt the hotel was awful
However we loved Marrakesh and would go back again but never to this hotel
You can get much better for your money

"I reserved this hotel for two nights because I am familiar with the Sofitel brand and I was willing to pay for a clean space and great service. The hotel itself is very clean but the staff knows nothing about customer service. It’s embarrassing that Sofitel would not invest in proper training for their staff. They would rather argue with a customer instead of finding a resolution to the simplest of issues. The staff is RUDE and mean. Do not go to this Sofitel if you expect any type of customer service. "
"We are actually out to marrakech for a relaxing weekend . We choose sofitel to be sure about the quality and cleaness as we use to get to this hotel branch all over the world . However big surprise, in the reception the table was dirty with cigarette Durst . We said it may happen . But the worst ever was the outdated room . It is 7am I am up because of a horrible mattress and my back is all hurting . I can not even understand how they get the 5 start not providing the basic which is a comfortable night sleep.  They turned out weekend for a nightmare . As we wanted just to relax and stay for the whole weekend in a good hotel and now we have to change it with all the movement and stress around .

The food was great , the people in the reception welcoming .  But the room far from cory not comfy.  

Run away if you want to have a rest , bad bed and dirty rest room .

"I went for dinner with my mum after spending a lovely 4 days in Marrakech in the Medina and we fancied some nice restaurant cuisine and the whole thing from start to finish was terrible. No drinks menus given, when my mum ordered wine the waiter walked away and asked me 'Do you not like wine?!' I thought this was rude and insulting, for all he knows I could be a recovering alcoholic (I'm not I'm just doing dry January) but more politely he could have asked would I like a glass or something less intrusive. Also the wine requested he said we dont have then brought the first choice out as per the original request. The bread plates weren't cleared away and the table was spilling over. I had some mint tea and another waitress came to pour some and it was empty and so was the glass and the  just left it on the table without taking it away! The starters were wrong and when the right one did come the foie gras was awful. I ordered a medium rare veal and it arrived well done. My mum ordered shin of beef which was really fatty and looked like something from medieval times and adding to that they almost put the mains at the wrong table . At this point I said forget the main we just want the bill and I have never been looked at like this in a restaurant and asked 'Is there a problem?!' And the tone was rude. And yes there is a problem, the whole thing was awful. We did only get charged for the starters and the drinks which still came to 900 dhs. All in all very uncomfortable and unenjoyable experience when I expect more from such a well known reputable chain. I have had better service in a McDonalds! Would not recommend in the slightest "
"My booking agent booked a nonrefundable rate BY ACCIDENT and called to ask to change it immediately.  They said no.  They constantly said no to changing it.  It was a $1,300 reservation and they caused SUCH HASSLE to do this.  In the end, my booking agent lost the money not me, but it caused so much stress.  They should have allowed us to change because we called IMMEDIATELY.  VERY mean spirited of them, and they should learn the lesson not to pinch pennies today because tomorrow they will realise that they have no more friends to pinch from."
"Rooms are spacious with good view -but team is not professional in dealing with guest expectation -restaurant staff horrible in service each time we went there -breakfast was chaotic and breads are kept in restaurant's one corner -check out was horrible -one desk pushed to other desk because of their cashier available in old part of hotel only -reception team /cashier were rude -concierge was more helpful to taxi driver than our welfare !hair dryer in room was missing it took few hours after visit to room by HOUSEKEEPING staff that we are telling truth that no hair dryer in there in room !!constant noise in night from unloading of material in hotel"
"Very poor experience 
We arrived at the Sofitel Spa  hotel after a wonderful ten days in Morocco . 5 days in the Ryad Dyor in Marrakesh which was exceptional in every way and 4 days in Casablanca Four Seasons hotel , again a wonderfully comfortable hotel. So, we were looking forward to our last night’s stay here . Not good from the start ,sadly  , there was some confusion over the booking which we did resolve quite quickly and the young man dealing with it at reception offered us a free breakfast to make  up for this , a nice gesture. He then went off duty and two rather rude female  receptionists took over . They quickly retracted the offer of breakfast and asked us to prove we had been made this offer. She was more than rude and I can honestly say I have never been treated in this way before , checking into a hotel . It was embarrassing, dismissive and poor service on every level  . Having virtually accused us both of lying She then abruptly dismissed us , we went to our room to find someone  else’s case in it and a welcome note  that was not for us on the bed . We went back to reception , again the receptionist was dismissive , no hint if an apology either . They removed the case . The room we were given was old and tired looking and needed a revamp , the bed uncomfortable , stained carpets and grubby floors . There is a new section  to the hotel and you need to ask to be here as the old part of the hotel is not good . We had a good meal in the restaurant but were served out of date flat  beer , again no apology or replacement for  this  . We hoped to have a swim in the indoor pool but were informed there was a charge of £25 per person for two hours , don’t think so ! 
So we will never stay there again and it definitely tarnished what had been to that point a wonderful stay in Morocco .  I think some staff there need to understand what real customer service is and how to offer  the high standard if care I am  sure the hotel would want . So disappointed and upset by the whole experience ."
"As we booked our trip through Pin High because of the golf, I wasn't able to add the points to my membership - which I understand. However, being an Accor long term member, I've never felt so unwelcomed in a hotel, let alone 5 stars one. The first disappointment was during the check-in. 

We were greeted by an unfriendly lady who asked for our passports and a credit card - no more word about anything or further information. We were offered tea, a very talkative concierge came to offer tours and gave us a map. After waiting for over one hour, we asked another receptionist (this time a friendly guy) what time we would be able to check-in and that we would like to have our documents back. The unfriendly lady was rude to the guy telling him that she had already told us that the check-in would be after 3 pm - WHICH SHE DIDN'T - as she didn't speak to us and we were waiting since noon.  We asked for our luggage so we could change and go somewhere until we were able to check-in.

We came back around 4 pm with the hope that our room would be ready. Another surprise and another receptionist asking for our passports and credit card because he didn't have a clue that we already had done that, and couldn't find anything under our names. In the meantime, a third receptionist came with a machine and asked us to put our pin code to guarantee a deposit on our credit card. When were almost using our pin code, to my surprise, the credit card wasn't ours - it was from another guest. After waiting for this joke to be over, we were given our key - but no luggage, as it was stored in the hotel since noon.

We gave the luggage ticket to the receptionist who said he would take care of that and the luggage would be sent to our room. Another 40 minutes wait, a call to the reception and the luggage was brought by someone who said the receptionist never told him to bring the luggage. 

Unfortunately, it was not the end of the joke, as both suitcases were wet on the back, including the cover, with something that smells like alcohol. We called the reception and a lot of funny questions were asked. My husband went to the reception with his suitcase and showed to the ""chef of the concierges"", who questioned whether something wasn't broken in the suitcase because it wasn't possible that this could have happened there etc and that the suitcases were already like this when we left at the hotel. 

My husband is a very patient person, but he got very annoyed and brought the other suitcase to this gentleman who insisted it didn't happen there. Very bad service for a 5 stars hotel. 

As nothing was damaged inside our luggage and the golf bags were fine, we let this go for a moment. After less than 30 minutes, the suitcases were dry, which means that it definitely happened in the hotel, and possible, just before the suitcases were brought to our room. I spoke with this ""chef of concierge""  that it was almost dry and it indeed happened at the hotel. I had to hear from him that people start to use their minds and try to investigate things to find out what might have happened. At that stage, I was looking for a hidden camera.

I have to admit that luckily, we had the chance to meet nice people at the hotel: the lady who makes pancakes and three friendly waiters in the breakfast room. 

We booked a tour to the Atlas and were given a price in EURO and were told that we should pay by cash - which is a bit weird -  by a guy that was at the concierge's desk, but wasn't the concierge or the ""chef of the concierges"". I asked for the price in Dirham and said I was going to book later. When we went to book the tour, we gave the cash to the concierge and were expecting the change. When I asked for the change, we got offended and threw the money on the desk and asked me to get it. It doesn't matter if the change is one or one hundred, what is right is right.

I could carry on but I will conclude at the check-out. We got the bill and noticed that they charged us twice for the Christmas dinner: one on the 22.12 and the other one on the 24.12. We explained that it wasn't correct and after a lot of talk between the receptionist, the lady who booked the dinner and another guy, the concluded that we were indeed correct. 

Our trip to Marrakech could have been spectacular, however, due to the lack of hospitality and proper training of the staff, it wasn't. I can't recommend this destination neither this hotel.

The close this long story, during my stay, I contacted Accor Customer Service one day after we checked-in to complain about the check-in/ luggage experience and never heard from them. As an ALL member, it just got more disappointing.

At the Sofitel Marrakech Lounge and Spa the customer is always wrong! Here is a customer who will never come back."
"This is an enormous hotel. Far too big and impersonal. We came to golf and the concierge knew nothing of our booking. 
The restaurant Orangerie is dark and service is slightly muddled. 
Rooms are greAt and the breakfast a feast even a little OOT. 
If you like the rich and snob this is your kind of hotel. "
"The room had a stench of guttering once called reception we found out the sink was blocked ! And then after the toilet wouldn't flush I was very dissapointed especially  paying for a junior suite.  The smell from the room the was bad I complained but nothing was really done apart from a little fragrance  squirt in the room, I've been a member for along time this situation was the worst ever!!"
"Stayed here for a couple of nights before staying in Adajar for 4 that turned out to be worse. However we felt this was a good base for the Desert Camp and Casablanca. How wrong we were. 
Food was drink terrible probably on par with a wetherspoons and rooms were scruffy.
Was disappointing that we could not watch the rugby anywhere either as nowhere had it on.Just glad it wasnt the final I missed.
Decent kebab shop nearby but that was not enough for me to make a decent holiday.
Dont be fooled by 5* rating, would rather stay in the 1* sea hotel in my home town."
"We went there to have dinner with friends. Lovely place and they booked a nice table for us. However you are seating on sofas and it is not comfortable at all to eat.
It took a while before to order but the food was very good so worth the wair. Service was very slow and not specially friendly.
It took us 20 min to get the bill which came wrong, and another 20 min to have it sorted. The waiter who took the payment said he could not type the dot on the credit card machine and had to round it above, which is very weird as his colleague could do it?!
Overall good food but the service brings everything down."
"During an exhibition I stayed for 6 nights at this property. The hotel and its facilities Are ok and I would rate that with 4 stars. But when it comes to the service level I must admit that was the poorest experience for a very long time. With the exception of the housekeeping lady (which was excellent) and one person (in charge of making the fresh juices at breakfast) the whole team significantly underperformed. As an example - while we were having dinner and eating our main course a server came and asked us to fill out a form on our preference in room categories. Ordering tea without sugar basically a mission impossible. Overall the service level was unacceptable. "
"The hotel was beautiful and some staff like Soukaina and Ihram were genuine. However, we had a terrible experience with the rest of the staff and it ruined our trip completely. 
On the first 2 days we waited 15minutes just for a sun bed whilst other French-speaking guests were offered and shown sun beds instantly (they arrived after us). Then another guest took pity upon us and offered his sun bed to us as he saw we had a baby with us and were completely ignored by all staff at the pool. We then entered the pool and were inside for 1hour 30mins simply because staff at the pool could not be bothered to supply us with towels despite asking on 4 occasions (twice to the same member of staff who told us he is ""tired""). This is the kind of service from a supposedly 5* international chain - ridiculous! This happened on 2 days so we felt victimised as we don't speak either of the native languages. We then complained to a manager called Yaseen, who offered us complimentary access to the VIP pool for the rest of our stay along with free lunch for the day. This was lovely of him. However, even though Yaseen has explained to staff at the VIP pool that we had access, we were then questioned and denied access every day for the duration of our stay. Each time we had to then ask the pool staff to call the manager and confirm that we were allowed to use the VIP (extreme) pool. This was extremely embarassing and made us feel as if we were not worthy of using the facilities. 
Upon check out, it took 30minutes just for concierge to send a bellboy up to our room to collect our luggage. Then as we were settling our bill, the hotel had charged us for usage of the VIP pool and for the free lunch for the day that we were offered. We then spoke to manager Yaseen again who told us ""there's nothing he can do."" On further debating and arguing, he then decided to waive the cost of the access and lunch that had been offered to us for free. He then went to consult a colleague and was gone for more than 15minutes and left us sitting at the reception. We went to find him to see that he was having lengthy conversations with guests and waiters at the breakfast lounge, whilst we were left waiting and needed to catch a flight. Due to this inconcvenience, we then arrived at the airport to find that the bag drop counter had been closed, we were sent to various counters only to find them closed and responses we got from staff were ""it's not my responsibility."" Therefore we missed our flight.  I have never seen such lazy and incompetent staff in the world, as I have seen in Morocco, both at Sofitel and at the airport. They have cost us an arm and leg due to their sheer arrogance and incompetence. 
I cannot believe how a 5* chain such as Sofitel is allowing this to happen as usually they are great in other countries and I frequently stay at Sofitel in different countries. It had ruined my holiday completely and this was to celebrate my anniversary. Thanks Sofitel for an awful time, you will definitely be hearing from us further as this kind of disgusting behaviour and service is not acceptable."
"We are a family of 4 (sons 16 and 14) who have traveled all over Africa and the Middle East.  We had a wonderful week in Morocco beginning with 2 nights in La Mamounia (highly recommend: excellent service: very discreet and professional) and closing out (after doing a desert camp, and overnights in Dades and Fes) at the Sofitel.  We were really looking forward to this as our last night but what a disaster.  Service was as some others have noted: disinterested and/or unresponsive.   We were tired after coming from Casablanca and decided to eat in at the Terrace restaurant.  Big mistake:   First question was not how we were, or would we like a drink but would we like a Sofitel credit card?! No.  Second issue was the giant TV screens showing circuit loops of the nightclub (tacky) but worst of all by 1am my husband and I had dreadful cramps and all the usual food poisoning signs.  Called the front desk at 7am to tell them and to ask if they had any pharmacy suggestions.   The woman could not have been less interested  and made no comment apart from saying she could call a doctor.  I said we had a long day of flying ahead and needed to leave within the hour.  She said there was nothing she could suggest: there was no apology, no concern, no questions.  Hugely ironic that we’d eaten at random places all week with no issues and we got laid out on the last night in a supposedly 5 star hotel!    I rarely write negative reviews but this was just not good and we had a very rough travel day.  Would not recommend."
"Not happy with the fact that after being asked to write a review the lady takes my phone and inputs special mentions with different members of staff who I hadn't even had a conversation with. I found this so unprofessional. I felt like there was a pressure for me to write a positive review as she lingerd over me. With disappointment we left and felt like the worker 'Soukaina' had just used us for the review. She imputed in the review as follows 'thank all the staff especially soukaina siham souhaila Nouaamane Omar khadija Wafae and the manager Wiam.' How can a worker take a customer's phone and input more information  so that they get praise. This is rude and unprofessional."
"Went for drinks in the outside lounge to start with. Hostess spent the entire time there taking Kim Kardashian style selfies, of all the waiters there only one seemed to be actually working out of around 15. A vodka martini isn’t that hard... it was for the barman. Dry with a twist came back as a vodka martini mix with an olive. Tried the bar at the back. Just as bad. Tired, slow service, insipid cocktails and stupidly over-priced. A must not experience "
"Do not book with this hotel. Ruined our recent visit to Marrakech.

Booked this hotel through Alpha Rooms. Upon arrival to the hotel we provided our voucher showing proof of payment. However, the morning of check out Sofitel informed me they had not received the full payment from Alpha Rooms and were holding myself and wife accountable and demanded that we paid the full weeks accommodation directly to them. This was as we were leaving to get our flight home. 

I completely understand they want to be paid for the service they provided, but this is an issue with Alpha Rooms and the hotel themselves. We arrived on the 15th May, departing on the 22nd and Sofitel decided to deal with the issue of non payment as we were leaving for our flight home. They had 7 days previous to resolve this. We refused to pay as we had already paid in full and found it completely unfair to demand us to pay again before letting us leave for our flight home.

After a discussion with Sofitel front desk they agreed to let us leave to catch our flight and agreed it was an issue between with Sofitel and Alpha Rooms and they would follow up with them.

The day after, 23rd May I checked my account to see Sofitel have taken the full amount out of my bank account! I have already paid Alpha Rooms 2 weeks prior to arrival and now because of the incompetence of the booking agent and booking department of Sofitel I have now had to pay this hotel twice and I am £1600 out of pocket.

Who knows how this will ever be resolved with the agent and hotel both blaming one another!"
"The hotel is very poorly managed . We reached hotel at 10 Am and the room was not ready before 4.30 PM .  There was no rack to keep the luggage and when asked for they came up with soiled dirty one . There were no water bottles.  Forget about the staff who have difficulty to say Good Morning or Hello .  Rooms are Old and not very functional .Poor amenities in the bathroom . Some Novotels or Ibis are much better . Too expensive for what it is ."
"A huge hotel, well located with a great pool area. But most of rooms are old and in bad condition. 
A superb breakfast buffet, but like for the rest of the hotel a quasi non existing service . Medium quality restaurant on first floor with a very arrogant lady management.
Nice terrasse bar, but again total lack of service .
Room cleaning is Ok and staff friendly , like f.e. Mrs Hayat. Concierge for taxis is also fine , but all overall this SOFITEL is lacking a good management ."
"The photographs on the website and those included in promotions are completely misleading as these rooms are in the Spa wing. The general rooms are quite small and dark,although adequate.

The service is appalling - 30 minutes to get a diet Coke at the pool bar- seriously.

Only food available in the evening is either room service of the fine dining restaurant, which is, to be fair, not very fine. My food was cold and tasteless.

Worst of all,I had two items of clothing go missing frrom my bedroom. While I spoke to the duty manager at the time, who promised a full investigation, I have still not heard a word from the hotel (3 weeks now), despite contacting them by email and telephone. 

Really shocking customer service!"
"A group of 7 couples booked rooms after a thorough search including website evaluations. We were totally mislead by the website which showed beautiful rooms only to find out they existed in the spa only. Our rooms were outdated, dingy, and dirty.  The site totally misrepresented them. When we tried to discuss with the manager he was “not available” the entire stay.  In fact the entire staff showed zero interest in helping us nor did they offer any reconciliation. The breakfast was horrible and the service poor. I recommend you reconsider other hotels before you book here.  "
"1.never make me feel that i am a platinum member. service very ordinary
2. lighting in suite very bad. being 65yrs old, difficult to find my things.no lights in ward robes 
3. only given 2 bottles of water. its takes nearly an hour to get more water"
"This lounge bar service is worst and nothing. I and friends visited here and they didn't accept the visa card at all. 
For 30mins they said nothing and no excuse. Should we come back here again?
Their reaction and treatment is worst ever."
"We spent a disappointing week at this hotel. Wanted to be able to say better things but it doesn’t match up to 4 or 5 star standards. Weak 3 star is probably a fair assessment. Coffee at breakfast took 5 or 6 requests and 30-40 minutes. Room was decent sized and had nice view of the mountains but was very dark, had extremely limited electrical outlets, bad shower and service was inconsistent and poor. 
Would seek a better option."
"Very bad experience for a five star hotel like Sofitel Marrakech
I handed over the passports of mine and my wife and had to wait for almost an hour to check me in even though it was about 8 pm
Will never go back to the same place..

"
"We are platinium members of the Accor hotels and regular guest of Sofitel across the world.
During our stay in Sofitel Mareakech we experienced the worst service level ever in à Sofitel.
Our stay started with the staff lying to us about our room being ready then not ready then being cleaned then not, etc. Afterwards, everything we asked was too much effort. Many staff members look like you bother them when asking for something : coffee, clean napkin, dry cleaning,...
It is true that some do their work properly and with smile. Unfortunately it is far from being the majority. 
For the ones used to Sofitel high end experience, this is a NO GO."
"Don’t expect much from this hotel regarding service. Checked in 5 rooms in the morning and had 2 guests to join us later on because their flight arrived later on and they suddenly refused to check them in and refused to listen. 

Being a Accor Platinum Member I have never seen such a low standard for a 5 star hotel. The First surprise was that they are not able to retrieve your status because their system is not capable to do so. I have travelled a lot but such a attitude and rudeness I have hardly discovered. The management should train their staff better and teach them that in the Hotel Business it’s all about customer service. Giving a good experience and being polite creates a good experience for the guests who will return again one day.

We wanted to stay for 5 days but decided to check out today. We are not willing to pay 400$ a night and get treated badly. There are many better 5 Star Hotels who will appreciate our business more."
"Had a few issues staying at this hotel. First gripe, housekeeping repeatedly made the room up for 1 person (1 water, 1 towel, 1 side of the bed turned down) after several complaints to reception and reminders that there were two people staying in the room, as per the booking.
Second issue, are in the french restaurant and had bad unorganised service (appetisers arriving after mains, non smoking table sat next to smoking area, inattentive waiters), we even moved tables at the end of our meal and no one bothered to check if we were okay, just smiled to acknowledge we’d moved, very strange restaurant service.
Booked a private trip to the Atlas Mountains through the concierge, the driver was uninterested in us, constantly on his mobile phone and had to be prompted to stop for photo opportunities. The trip included a guided hike to see the waterfall but we were asked to pay a separate tour guide upon arrival, very rushed, literally up and down in under an hour; it’s meant to be 45 mins hike each way.
The hotel is beautiful, pool area is very nice and well kept, as was the spa. We didn’t have a terrible experience, this hotel just isn’t up to the usual Sofitel 5 star standards.
It’s just a shame that these instances occurred, which I put down to lack of attention to detail and management organisation.
I complained to the Director of Guest Services on our last day, he seemed typically uninterested, took my contact details and promised to follow up... I wasn’t ever never contacted."
"I have stayed at Sofitel before and this hotel is definitely subpar and brings down the reputation of Sofitel! 

Let me start with the negatives 

1. There are 2 Sofitel hotels with separate lobbies. The Sofitel Lounge and spa reception is closed most of the day so you have to go to the neighboring Sofitel  reception (female staff are extremely helpful and probably the only good thing about this hotels service)

2. There is no organization at reception. Pretty much chaos. I was being helped to check-in and receptionist stopped half way and decided to help 2 other people. 

3. We were told to wait in by the bar for room key. Don’t even get me started at bar service. Please go somewhere else for drinks. The pina colada was watered down. Even if drinks were subpar it’s ok but the staff is not up to par with service. 

4. We were at the bar for half hour and no one delivered luggage to our room. We went in first and 10 minutes later luggage arrivistes. They were probably waiting so we could tip them. 

5. We requested a check out and it took them 25 minutes to come help get our luggage.

6. We requested a cab and the hotel staff picks a number for cab price and not the cab driver. So I guess the cab driver and hotel staff have a commission going on. 

7. Elevators were not functioning so we took the stairs. 

Positives

1. Breakfast was an amazing selection. With mediocre service. The staff is usually chitchatting. 

2. So Lounge service staff and the longe was pretty good. 

3. Rooms were very clean "
"The holiday in the hotel was going really well until one night during our stay at Sofitel my boyfriend and I decided to spend the night at a friend's. Since we were late and in a rush to leave the hotel for dinner, I forgot to leave a very important necklace in the safe, where all the other valuables were kept, but left it inside a bag instead. The next day we came back and the necklace was not in the place where I left it anymore. Call me stupid for not remembering to put it in the safe, but it is unacceptable that these things happen in a 5 star hotel. A hotel is given 5 stars if it makes you feel at home... these things in my home do not happen. Obviously even after the denunciation the cleaning lady was kept working there, so you might want to watch out if you're planning a trip there."
"So booked here for the last night of our trip. A bit of luxury and lose to the airport for the flight. We arrived over an hour ago still don’t have a room (which was pre-booked). Sitting in reception and using their WiFi to write this review. Going to give them 5 more minutes before I cancel it and go somewhere else. In two words ‘bloody awful’. The worst service from the most expensive hotel! Classic!"
"Location: 

This Sofitel Hotel is located in an exclusive part of Marrakech.

We have booked a double bed room of the category Deluxe Koutoub.

Check In:

Upon arrival late evening we have not received a warm welcome.
No water, drink or sweets were offered.
But I was forced to give them my credit card although the room rate was prepaid. 
After a longer discussion I got informed that they wanted to charge me in advance in case that I would take something out of the Mini Bar.
I have rejected this wish. Then I needed to pay the City tax in advance!

After this Check In we got guided to our room.

Room:

The room (176) was at the end of the building.

The room was dark like in a hole although the light was switched on!

And more important: The so named Deluxe room was as simple as in a 2 Star Hotel.

It has a small balcony facing a part of the garden and the street.

Bar at 1. Floor:

Then we visited the Bar, located in the first floor.

The music was playing very loud like in a Discotheque.

It was almost impossible to hold a conversation.

Most of the staff was caring about themselves.

They were playing with their cell phones or holding a small talk.

 Even when they stand in a group 3 meter away from us they have not cared or paid attention at us.

We ordered a bottle of Medaillon rouge red wine, charged with 440 Dirham, (about 45 €).

In other exclusive restaurants in the city of Marrakech we got charged with 260-340 Dirham for the same wine.

On another day in the Bar of this hotel we had the same problems with the staff! 

The day before our departure we have asked for the bill.

We got presented the booklet, opened it and it was empty!!! There was no bill inside!

Breakfast: 

Upon arrival we got asked for our room number.

Then a young waitress wanted to guide us to our table. 

But she did not know where a free table was available.

After walking together more than 5 minutes I have asked her if she does know where a free table is. 

She said yes and disappeared and let us stand alone.

So we went back to the entrance, made a complaint and a supervisor brought us to a table which was not cleaned.

 It took almost 10 minutes until it was done.

Even the table was not cleaned in a proper way. 

Still bread crumbs were left. Then I got a cup for the coffee (out of a cupboard) which was still dirty.

Now we saw that 90% of the plates were empty and not refilled.

In general the choice of cold cuts was poor.

When trying to get strawberries out of a pot at the same time (!) a cook also tried to catch the rest of it to prepare a juice. He was unwilling to wait till the guest has picked his fruits!

The ambiance of this breakfast restaurant room is very simple.

Cheapest sofas and chairs are available in this 5 Star Hotel.

In general we found chaos in organizing this breakfast.

There is enough staff, but most of them are unorganized and not well trained and not well organized.

Most have a very limited knowledge of English.

Finally I cannot recommend this hotel.

My subjective rating:

Check In: 1 point

Room: 2 points

Value for money: 2 points

Look of public areas: 4 points

Service: 1 point

"Doormen took our luggage, but did not give us a receipt, so when we were finally ready to go to our rooms, we had to search the lobby for our bags  It took nearly an hour for them to check us in -- while waiting, no explanation what was taking so long, no beverage offered, nothing.  We had 2 rooms booked on 1 reservation -- they did not give us adjoining rooms, in fact, my single room was far away and a terrible location.
No one staffing the concierge desk for more than 20 mins.  I asked for help, they ""called"" concierge, then disappeared.  When he finally came back, and I expressed my displeasure, he just sneered at me and grudgingly barely answered my questions.  I had to ask twice to get a city map.
At breakfast there were tons of employees milling about, but getting a cup of coffee or glass of water too ages.  And we had to ask for refills.  We were missing a place setting for one person, but even after pointing this out - nothing.  We had to steal one from another table.
My husband had his Bachelors and Masters from the Cornell University School of Hotel Administration and he would be rolling over in his grave to have seen such awful service from a supposed 5 star hotel.  Will never stay in a Sofitel again."
"The hotel is very old and not (in my personal opinion) worth the 5 stars and the high price. The location is great, but the service is extremely slow. I ordered food from the room service it took so long, checking in took around an hour and half, calling my car from valet took very long time. Slow service is the hotel’s culture (in my experience)."
"This hotel is a 4 star maximum. Friendly staff, however if you want to relax at the infinity pool as a hotel guest you have to pay 400 dirham. Which is approx 37 EUR, per day. Furthermore the room was ok. The tv was hanging with an angle, stains on the carpet. I was sleeping on the yardside but there was music every night. Can be good, except if you have to sleep.  And last but not least, i had to leave two nights earlier and the hotel wouldn’t refund me two nights, i have sent an e-mail requesting this but zero response. If the manager reads this, don’t reply with your standard apologies answer, get back to me on my e-mail and think with me to at least refund one of the two nights i haven’t slept in your hotel."
"The hotel itself is very nice and has a very good location. We had booked a Junior Suite and one Deluxe Double Room, but I have never seen a more unfriendly, condescending and arrogant Reception and especially concierge in my life. At arrival at the hotel, we have been greeted with a gesture to sit down at one of the lounges. The reception was crowded with staff, but none of them made an attempt to check us in. So we waited and waited. At some point I just lost my patience so I went up to the reception and asked one of the ladies, if she could kindly check us in. All I got was a ""yes yes we will"", but she made no attempts to do so, instead she waited for another guy, who was still busy with other guest to check us in. We counted six employees plus one concierge behind reception at that point and there is only one person, who can check in guest? Seriously? 
Later on that night, two of us went to the reception again to get some money changed. I know what is coming is my own fault, but please learn from my mistakes. We handed the man each 400 DHS to get changed into some smaller bank notes. He counted the money behind the desk and then just threw it in front of us. As I HATE counting money infant of people I just took the money and went to the bar, where I counted the money. Here I had to notice, that they had only given me 300 DHS although I gave them 400 DHS. 
However the unfriendly and most arrogant concierge topped it all. We had different tours booked through our travel agency, who left the pick up times with the concierge. So the day before our first trip we went up to the concierge and asked him for the pick up time. He didn't even bother to look if there was a massage but just condescendingly informed us, ""No, no information!"" So we called our travel agent who informed us, that they had called reception two hours ago, to inform them about ur pick up time. So the next morning we waited for the pick up and as after 20 minutes no one arrived we called the emergency hotline to ask when we will be picked up and where informed, that they had called the hotel again in the afternoon and informed them, that the pick up will be later. Nothing of this had been passed on to us. 
We played the same game with the concierge again for the next tour, after we confronted him, that he had received the information but had not passed them on he just sent us away with a hand wave. However 20 minutes later at a quarter to eleven we have been slipped a note under the door with our pickup time. Every time we went up to the concierge his fist questions was, did you book through us or agency if you told him, that you booked through the agency he made no effort looking at all just straight away said his usual sentence ""No, no information for you"" it was just as if they are withholding information from guest who have not been willing to book excursions and trips to their ridiculous high prices. 
The service at the Darkum Bar has been very good, although the prices are relatively high, also compared to other hotels here. However there was one thing that really bugged us. It is without any questions, to leave a tip, but we do not want to be reminded to leave a tip every time we are handed the bill. By the third day the waiter knew our order by hard and he should have also known, that every day we left a tip when we paid the bill. But still every time we have been handed the bill, it was handed to us with the addition ""also, service charge not included!"" I think this is rather rude to do so every single time. 
The service at the pool was a whole other level. Prices are way too high and you have to wait ages for your order. We paid the waiter in cash and waited for the change for over an hour. After asking the waiter several times, we just decided to leave it and never pay cash at the pool again. 
Breakfast is good, but service is very uncoordinated and the are just standing in the way of each other. There are so many employees standing around, and orders are constantly passed on from one waiter to another. So how do they expect to get it right in the end? Wa have been waiting for a glas of orange juice for over 30 minutes until we decided to get it ourselves from the service station. Three white collars have been standing on the terrace and watched us, but never made any attempt to actually do their job. 
If you wanted the minibar to be refilled, you literally had to beg at the reception for it. Also there seems to be a difference in service people received when booking a suite or a double room. At the suite we received a turn down service every day, shampoo was refilled regularly, etc. but not so much at the Double Room. Here after eight days we received the first and only turn down service. Some days the shampoo was not refilled, so we had to take the soap, cotton pads etc. were at the room. Every gust pays a fair amount of money, so at least the amenities in the room should be the same for all guest.
It is a nice hotel, but with a lot of room for improvement."
"Arrived today at the Sofitel. Hotel is beautiful! There’s no doubt about that. But as our room weren’t ready we decide to go for some lunch in one of the restaurants. Buffet restaurant we was told to be seated and someone would come over. We waited 45 mins and no one came. So went to the bar restaurant and waited 2 hours to be seen to. After placing our order we waited a further hour for a bottle of water to arrived. Followed 20 mins later by food! Not a good start. Finally gets to our room and so disappointed. This hotel states 5star luxury and we booked a superior room. This is a birthday present for my sister. There is nothing superior about this room! There’s a travel kettle, shabby dated furniture. The bathroom is dark, tiny and one robe. When I called to ask could we be moved I was told that was the room I’ve paid for! This is my third visit to Marrakesh and always been impressed in other hotels visited! This I would never stay again or advise to come."
"First the positives:

Great location within 5 minute walk of the medina and thus convenient for exploring the main sights in Marrakech. Also a short 10 minute taxi ride from the airport ( don’t pay more than 100 Dirham ).

The pool area is very nice with plenty of beds and lounging areas. 

The pool bar / cafe also had a nice lunch menu and staff here were friendly and engaging. 

 Now for the negatives:

Emails to the hotel prior to arrival required chasing several times to elicit a reply. Taxi transfer from airport was quoted at £50 for 4 of us ( regular taxi is £8 for a 10 minute ride ) I specifically requested non-feather duvets and pillows due to an allergy. I finally got an acknowledgement and confirmation this would be provided but on arrival in room this request had not been fulfilled. A quick call to reception I hoped would resolve matters. Sometime later housekeeping attended to the matter. However later that evening I realised they had simply replaced feather pillows and duvet with , you guessed it, feather pillows a duvet. Finally resolved by 1230am.

In general we found the reception staff to be abrupt, arrogant and very unhelpful. Restaurant staff at breakfast were similarly inattentive .. we had to ask for coffee rather than it being offered and we got a distinct impression guests were seen as a bit of a nuisance rather than there to be served.

I left feeling that the majority of staff would benefit from some serious customer service training, how to smile and engage with guests and proactively seek to meet their needs. I would not recommend this hotel sadly, which is unusual for the Sofitel group where elsewhere I’ve have found to be excellent. Marrakech misses the mark by a long long way. 
"
"We had an awful stay when we arrived we were greeted with a finger pointing to a sofa to sit there. I had a feeling this was going to be the start of a bad stay. We had to continually ask for towels face cloths etc... and a hair dryer -these aren’t in the rooms.

At breakfast the tables were dirty unset I asked for tea 4 times in two occasion and finally gave up and drank my husbands coffee. 

The hotel is impersonal, unfriendly and I would never stay here again. As a chef and a regular hotel user there needs to be some serious attention to staff training and customer service. If you want to operate large hotels make it personal other wise you won’t compete. 

"
"Hotel is beautiful but at every turn they aim to exploit the tourist by charging extortionate prices for food and drink. But you have a choice to eat and drink their. Our issue was we were charged £10 for three warm 330ml bottles of water delivered to the room. This was not explained at checkin but only when checkin out, not part of the mini bar and not even cold. We raised the issue but arrogant staff simply shrugged shoulders and say they would pass on the complaint. Simply a way to exploiting guests, very disappointing. Also failed to explain the tourist tax at checkin so you will be billed for this also when checkin out."
"I am a very frequent traveller and have been in alot of different hotels throughout the years. I was very dissapointed from this hotel. We booked a suite and certainly had also high expectations. The size of the suite was very nice but there where things like big ugly stains on the carpet as well as broken washbasins. Things that are completely unacceptable. The general posture of the service staff like concierge etc. is rather snobby and arrogant and not really caring. The price/service-quality ratio was one of the worst I have encountered on my world wide travels. To be fair: I had the same impression of the whole country Morocco.

Good points: The hotel has an impressive and nice pool. So if you do not have overly high expectations and like to hang around the pool this might be a good spot for you. I would not return anyways."
"My family stayed in Sofitel Marrakech during my traveling outside Morocco, the hotel is tired and old, newly renovated rooms were small and tasteless, the pool area is nice but everything else is not 5 stars, staff are not friendly and rigid, I wouldn’t recommend the hotel specially for the price, the only good thing about the hotel is location, heart of the city and walking distance to papular restaurants. "
"The hotel was beautiful but the service was poor. We ordered food by the pool, after 20 minutes we had to continuously ask where it was after an hour we finally received. When we checked we were requested to provide a card, which wasn't a problem. They took £329 for a damage deposit which was fine as we were advised we would get the money back when we checked out. However, when we checked out we were advised that we would get the money back within 24 hours. It has now been a week from checking out and I have still not received the amount back. When I called the hotel to find out what is happening, I receive poor service and attitude. I am truly disgusted with how I have been treated by the persons I have spoken and I would not stay at this hotel again."
"As a platinium member of Sofitel, I am extremly disappointed of the way a reservation agent has been talking to me. I called to make a reservation, and she seemed like she was doing me a huge favor. She was so rude, and kept cutting me, she even hung up on me. I have never been disrespected like that in any Sofitel that I have been too. They just lost me as a customer."
"My boyfriend and I have just got back from the Sofitel  Marrakech spa and lounge 
When we arrived everything seems perfect, we were sat down brought tea and hot towels which was lovely 
We checked in which was simple enough and given out room key.
We went up to our room which was lovely clean modern everything I was hoping for really.
The first day we went to the pool someone showed us to a bed and gave us towels.
The pool is beautiful.
The next day by the pool we wanted to order a fruit plate and water.
As one of the waiters walked by my boyfriend asked and the guy pretty much ignored him but we thought ok maybe he’s just busy so 15 minutes later the guy has walked passed us a few times have a laugh with the French people and ignoring us I said excuse me we ordered a fruit plate and he said yeah yeah it’s coming
Another 5/10 later I went to where the food is coming from and said excuse we order a bottle of water and fruit plate nearly half and hour ago and nothing I would mind if someone came and spoke to us but it was like we were aliens, after a very expensive but not existiant fruit plate came defiantly not worth the wait!!!!
At breakfast the next morning we went down for breakfast I’m vegan so of course there was not much for me to eat but I asked if I could get a morrocan salad but I just got looked at like I should speak French.
So I thought of I’ll go and get vegetables and make my own salad but the tomatoes were old bit fresh so I asked if I could have some fresh tomatoes and of course I waited and waited while the waiter walks passed it’s like I didn’t ask him it was strange 
I felt so angry as I was hungry and we were going out for the whole day so I wanted a good breakfast.
Overall I feel so staff need to make effort it seemed he French people got 100% more attention 
As an international hotel the staff need to be able to communicate with everyone"
"Poor service and poor quality of food.  We also got charged for a bottle of water from the mini bar when we didn’t take it. 

The ‘perfume scent’ in the hotel is sickening. 

I expected a lot more out of this hotel and was really disappointed. 

Hope this review is published as I truly feel there are better hotels in Marrakesh that are less expensive that offer a good quality of service."
"We booked a suite there because we only had a 3 night stay in Marrakech. We arrived 10 mins after check in time and were told that our room is not ready and that we should wait at the pool. After 1 hour I went to the reception and asked for our room again and it was still not ready. We were given a different room with a twin instead of a large double but they said they were gonna change this, don’t know how they thought they gonna change the bed?!?!?
Long story short. I spoke to the receptionists 5 Times in total with no help at all. This stay was a complete disaster when you take into account how much money you pay. 
"
"My husband and I came for a nice dining night to the restaurant at Sofitel. Actually I am a big fan of the sofitel in general because normaly it's always best quality and very friendly stuff but this time we had a very bad experience.
Around nine o'clock we came for dinner and the weighter offered us a buffet for 40€ each. We asked him how long the buffed will be open and he said until midnight, twelve o'clock. We went to the buffet, took a plate and sat down on the table outside, just five minutes later I went inside again to take something else to eat and the whole buffet was gone, just after five minutes!! I asked the weighter about the time, as he said midnight and he said he is sorry but the buffet ends now but if we want something he can ask for it in the kitchen. We tried to explan that we took the buffet to enjoy dining and choose from different meals but he said that's all he can do. than he left and didn't come back again.   He didn't offer us anything for compensation and we had to pay together 80€ for actually two small plates of food. 
Besides that the food was completely cold, very fatty and old. There were even flies sitting on some of the dished. I would never go there again!"
"I booked the suite at the hotel. The room was extremely nice however the service throughout my stay was extremely disappointing. Toiletries were not refreshed, laundry bags were not replaced, on one of the days the do not disturb sign was removed and never came back. The most disappointment can when it was raining one of the nights I requested the hotel personnel standing with umbrellas to help me with an umbrella to my car and they refused and said I needed to go to concierge and take their permission which was ridiculous. I finally chose to sprint to my car. On my return that night I had a similar experience, I had an elderly lady and a 8 month old kid in the car. The hotel staff refused to help with an umbrella to usher them into the hotel. After I went in and had to raise my voice I finally got some assistance. Even after this no one came to assist me with my luggage. After this incident I called for the hotel manager to visit my room and highlighted all the issues. He assured me that everything would be sorted out going forward. To my surprise absolutely nothing improved. Toiletries were still not refreshed, the laundry bag still not replaced nor the do not disturb sign returned. 
I doubt I will every stay at this resort again."
"Visited for two days in April which coincided with French school holidays. That should not be a problem but it was....1-2 hours wait for food during the day; cold coffees; too many suited managers and not enough front line staff around the pools who were totally overworked; run out of towels; etc etc.. Complete disorganisation and chaos.
Have stayed at other times when ok- so avoid April at this hotel."
"I am not one for writing reviews and my husband and I are pretty easy going when it comes to these things. However, we were really not impressed with this hotel and do not consider it to be deserving of it’s 5 stars. It looks beautiful and the breakfast was amazing. There was more choice of things to eat than you could expect each morning and everything was fresh. The pools were also quite inviting even though one was freezing cold. These are the main good points about the hotel. We could have put up with the fact that the food wasn’t that great at the restaurant in the evening or that the lift was broken or that our toilet leaked or that we found random toast on our balcony when we hadn’t eaten any toast but what we couldn’t put up with was the terrible service! The toast we found was never cleaned up. Sometimes our room wasn’t cleaned at all even if we were out all day and left the sign on the door to ask for it to be cleaned. Service was extremely slow whenever food or drinks were involved and staff were very rude to us and to each other. The first night one member of staff at the restaurant kept shouting at the other staff all of whom moved around a lot but never seemed to know what they were doing. During every meal or drink all we saw were staff arguing with each other or discussing things without actually doing very much because often people didn’t seem to know who was doing which job. By the third day we finally got good service at breakfast and there seemed to be some sort of organisation but it was never consistent in the 5 days we stayed at the hotel. People were rude, perhaps because our French wasn’t very good, but we did at least try and persevered rather than speaking only in English. I also asked for a hairdryer which was supposed to be included with our room and we were told I could have my hair dried at the Spa by one woman at the front desk. The following day I asked another employee and he said it’s in the draw. When we said it wasn’t there he said he would get one and it never arrived. These things made our stay very disappointing. It seems we were staying in the new side of the hotel which was only just finished so we understand it may have some problems like the leaky toilet and wall paint that was splattered places due to a quick finish and this would be acceptable. But it seems that this hotel can not cater for the amount of people that stay at the hotel and service was a great disappointment. I hope that once they get used to the new building being open the staff at this hotel will settle into what they doing. I would not stay here again or recommend it to anyone. I would recommend staying in Essouriara! Lovely people everywhere."
"Well I don’t know how shall I start 
The hotel itself just great and located in a very good location in town. Right next to the most important thing to do during your stay in Marrakech it’s also a beautiful place but and it’s a big but. The service in  
the hotel is No less then disgraceful
0 value for you money 
I visited in many Sofitel hotels in my life  it always was a big pleasure to stay with them until I tried Sofitel Marrakech 
So bad service so bad attitude 
And yet Morocco it a great place to visit with the  most amazing nice people they all so nice and friendly as well as welcoming 
Just stay away from Sofitel and all will be great in this magical wonderful country"
"Although located very centrally, this hotel is very old and has rooms spread around inconveniently.
Lobby looks good on pictures but the furniture is old and needs replacement. At check in we were given wet towels but they were not very pleasant to smell.

Checking in was easy and staff was good but the room was not worth a 4 star rating. Toilet seat had scratches and rooms had dim lite and I understand that may have been intentional.

Restaurant was good and had good choices. But overall if you are looking for a grand experience in Morocco, this is not the place."
"Maybe the mistake was mine... I should have read before booking that the Hotel is huge, I mean really big! And this is something I don't like in hotels. You fell like you are in a busy train station at rush hour all the time! The lobby is big, noisy, busy and with a lot of people smoking. When I say a lot, I mean A LOT! We got there at 4:30 pm and the room wasn't ready. Strange as the check out when you have to leave is 12:00. Anyway it didn´t take long to get into the room. And then the nightmare started... The room was old and outdated with a heavy decoration and dirty carpet but the worst of it was the smell!!! I thought I was inside an ashtray!!! Horrible cigarette smell! The following day I asked the reception if we could change the room due to the smell. They showed us another room but the smell was the same. In fact, the whole place smelled like that. Maybe I am not used to people smoking everywhere anymore because where I live it is not allowed. But there it seems that not only it was allowed but it was incentivated.
My husband suffers from rhinitis and the whole experience was just awfull.
The pool area is nice but again always crowded with people. Staff is polite but not kind and service in general is very slow. Breakfast offers many choices of food. Definetly do not recommend this place!"
"I’ll be concise, hope it’ll be helpful. Stayed there 6 days during Christmas, in a room on the first floor.

The good:

- working WiFi throughout 
- large sun beds
- outdoor pools & grounds 
- the staff at breakfast’s omelette station 
- the raspberry cocktail at Lawrence bar

The bad (long list):

- the long freezing corridors to get to room (10mins walk each time)
- pricey drinks (140dhs cocktail) and food (190dhs salad)
- the bedroom’s old and dusty decor
- walls not soundproof, you can hear everything from kids club to people next door. Cannot rest properly.
- the bed which was too small for the frame causing multiple leg bruises 
- the 30cm gap between the bed and the nightstands, impossible to reach for anything (see picture)
- the small bathroom with dripping oil/paint(?), a bit gross. (See pics)
- lack of body lotion
- products not being replenished each day (had to call twice to get cotton swabs)

The unacceptable :

- the Spa manager’s disdainful attitude and 
total lack of service. She was my trip’s biggest disappointment, the reason why I didn’t buy any products in the end, didn’t swim once, and the reason why I shall never go back to this hotel. 
She (short hair, glasses) does not deserve her job.
- the lack of skill and courtesy from unhelpful concierge (the big one)
- one night we came back to room without a drop of running water. Hence cannot wash hands, cannot shower, cannot go to WC. It took 3 phone calls and over one hour of insisting and speaking to manager to get the issue fixed.

Conclusion :

- a 3 star hotel at best
- not good enough to be named a Sofitel 
- not coming back, so many other great places to stay in Marrakech 

@management: please do not copy and paste your usual reply to this review. Use the time & effort to just get better."
"Arrived on Friday 24th of Nov with two other couples (our friends); we checked in slightly later than them. We were allocated a horribly positioned room in an external building where the building work was ongoing and our view was the building work; meanwhile our friends were upgraded complimentary to pool side views. I asked to also be upgraded but was told no other rooms were available; the bed was nice but the shower was blocked, the water was just 'Luke warm', there was no bidet in the toilet (toilet/bathroom were separate). I complained about the blocked shower and a plumber was sent to the room to report back to the reception staff; I waited for them to change my room but absolutely NOTHING was done about it! The staff were rude and unhelpful. 
Whilst me and my friends were sitting in the restaurant area during breakfast, service had finished but we were just chilling out., We asked for a bottle of water which we said we'd pay for but all the waiters could say was sorry service has finished and then they offered us an open bottle of water from when were serving!
We then thought lets go to the spa; to our surprise, we were told even if we are staying at the hotel, we must pay for the spa ie the sauna, jacuzzi, steam room. That in itself was shocking! I have never stayed at ANY spa hotel where these basic spa facilities have to be charged for!
Everything is a NO for the staff.. Appalled at how I was treated and will definitely never be going back to Sofitel or Morocco again!"
"Spent the afternoon with friends sitting on the terrace.
We all had non alcholic drinks 
The glasses were so packed with ice hence after sipping three straw fulls the only think left was ice!
Lots of staff standing around chatting but not serving.
We were given minute portions of dried hard spiced croutons we could not eat.
The masses of birds on our tables enjoyed them.
100 dirhams each drink I don't know how they justify their prices...will not be going again."
"I have been to many sofitels overr the world and have never had such bad experience! The hotel is quite old but authentic and has the charm of marrakexh but the attitude of staff and customers was shocking for me; i lost my phone in the vip swimming pool, the reaction of the reaponsible there was horrible: we can t do much for you! What??? I was shocked!!! I said tgis is a t star hotel you should.do a loooot when smthg like this happens! Then because we were 2 girls traveling alone i was horrified by the insolence of customers approaching us it is like we were in 2 stars hotel no respect what so ever to privacy if i knew the hotel was having this category of customers i would never step in and it s not a cheap hotel. The cherry on the cake waiters coming asking for phone numbers that other customers are asking for!! I didn t feel secured or havinf any kind of privacy or respect in thia hotel. So i don t recommend it at all! If you r traveling alone stay away of it!!"
"Awful service throughout our week stay here. At the reception desk although they see you waiting to be seen to they ignore you. All staff speak french and if you can't speak it they mock you and aren't interested in helping you. For a 5* hotel wasn't expecting such disgusting service. We even got asked our room numbers a couple of times by a staff member who has seen us day in day out around the pool area acting like we had walked in from the street! The food at the poolside restaurant is awful. The other restaurant in the hotel never seemed to be open. We had similar treatment at nearby food places because we didn't speak french. I would advise all to Stay Away!! "
"What can I say. What a fantastic hotel. Well done to Accor hotels. Unfortunately I cannot rate my experience at this hotel as 5* as the service and attitude of 80% of the staff was absolutely disgraceful. 

I've worked with 5* hotels, top restaurants and bars around the MENA region and to date have never experienced such horrendous service by the staff. It seemed as though many of the staff either were not happy to work there or had an issue with our group. If you want good, reliable, hard working staff please do speak to me; I know hundreds of hospitality staff that would be willing to provide 5* services to their guests. 

A couple of examples to set the tone would be making us wait at a table for 20-25mins just to take an order even though we had asked 2 people on 3 times we were ready to order even though there were more staff than customers at the poolside cafe/restaurant. Upon asking to speak to the manager of the outlet, I was abruptly asked ""why?"" by a waiter!! I didn't realise I had to justify myself. 

Food that we had ordered on a number of occasions was stone cold at the same poolside restaurant and also one evening when we ordered from room service.

Language here is definitely a barrier if you do not speak French as they really do act ignorant towards foreigners. It wasn't until we spoke a bit of French that the message was understood but even then the standards of service were far too relaxed and extremely moody.

Also the concierge in a hotel is supposed to be a responsible and respected position. Unfortunately the ones at Sofitel Marrakech have no idea as to what the guests are looking for and we were directed to some very quiet and romantic places even though we were 6 males. They have no idea of decent bars and restaurants in the area and we had to do most of the research ourselves.

All in all, the GM Ahmed Benkirane really needs to up the game of his staff. This is why I will not be staying here again when I come for a longer 5 night stay in November.

When a complaint was made at the reception regarding the service standards and how the group was treated, we were only offered a 30% discount on anything charged to one of the rooms. Between 6 people £200 just doesn't really cut it especially when you've each spent close to £850 for just flights and accommodation.

Service really has let down this hotel and being an international brand Accor need to take this seriously because you don't know who will walk in to your hotel and what type of service they are used to. Training needs to be given to all staff and a knowledgeable concierge team. I am also a strong believer that many of the staff at this hotel Base their level of service by judging looks of the guests. Something I'd expect at a 2 star hotel or bed and breakfast.

"Been here for a conference and hotel simply has no infastructure to support high occupancy. 
Waited 3 days for laundry 
Housekeeping officially the dirtiest room I have ever stayed in. 
Service is simply non existent. 
Staff seem to just refuse to serve you if you English. 
I am shocked that a hotel of this standard price and infrastructure can have such poor service. 
It is a overpriced and simply can't move the guest experience. 
The room have no glazing on the window so don't expect to sleep. 
"
"We booked this hotel for our one year wedding anniversary. Upon arrival the staff were very helpful, and gave us what they called an 'upgrade' to our room as it was our anniversary. However the room was on the 'old' side of the hotel which was a fair walk away from the pool and amenities, and had a balcony which you would struggle get 2 people on! so we requested to change, which they dealt with ok but only the could manage it on the 2nd night.
The complete let down of this hotel is the service. It's by fair the worst we've experienced. Staff appear as if they don't want to be there, by pushing each other to serve your table. 

We had dinner at the SO lounge on the first night, and there were only 3 tables eating that night but it still took absolutely ages to get served. Drinks kept being forgotten and all you could see were staff standing around not knowing what to do.

Each night it would take us almost 30min to get a drink at the bar (when there were only a handful of guests in there) and just as long to get the bill and be able to leave. 

They couldn't even manage to get us currency exchange when we needed it because 'they didn't have the key to the drawer'

Our new room was on the refurbished side, which they are still working on so is extremely nosey with the workmen. 

The cleanliness of the hotel should be questioned. On several occasions we saw room service trays left in the corridor by the lifts and the staff wouldn't clear it for days making the leftover food go mouldy (see pictures). 

As our flight back was in the evening, they offered us a room to shower and change in later so we could use the pool etc for the day. We were reassured 3 times we would have access to a room. But when it came to it, they couldn't find one for us and said we had to use the SPA facilities, which would've been ok if they staff there weren't so rude either and if they showers there didn't have cockroaches! 

It's not the service you expect from a 5 star worldwide chain."
"Initial appearance of the hotel has a wow factor as did the lobby and welcome drink. The 'please take a tea' while we checked in dragged out to over 30 minutes whereby we're told that there was a problem with our booking made through an internet travel agent as our credit cards didn't match the booking. Of course they didn't. The travel agent had booked with theirs. We were made to feel like criminals as we were told that the credit card used to book  must be the same as presented on arrival. This was not sorted out until the day of check out when we had a preauthorisation refunded. Bedroom was dark and bed and pillows far too soft. Laundry service poor, needing a search for shirts to be made and the food/drink while acceptable was stupidly expensive.
The predominant type of patron was young and self-entitled. At one stage we saw an obese young man filming one of the staff on his phone and making him sing. Whilst the member of staff complies with the guests request a punch in the face would have been a better response.
Despite ordering a car for our departure it was not there when required and turned up late. Flight was nearly missed because of this. 
Would I stay here again? No."
"I reached Sofitel imperial at night about 11:30pm, the concierge is too busy to care. They told us to wait for 5mins which became half an hour. After a long flight we were very tired but they didn't care. After a long time which seemed like a century the luggage man, who seemed the only nice person there, took us to the room. The room was located at least a km away and we had to use a old elevator. The lights in the room were not working. Overall, service bad. The smell in the hotel not good. Similarly another customer had made a reservation but the concierge had a problem locating that too. Service not good, atmosphere not good, comfort doesn't exist."
"Three of us were on business trip and booked 3 rooms for one night. The rooms were simply too old and ran down. I had stayed at many other sofitel hotels before and even Marrakech one years ago but never experienced such state . it makes you wonder what it is to be a brand if expectations are not met.
staff were friendly"
"when we entered the hotel we where offered welcome drinks. which we where charged for!

we booked a luxury suite. we where offered a from for 4 which was very different to the photos online and was in a part of the hotel that had building work going on - so we had scaffolding as view.

we asked to cancel the booking as we found a nearby suitable villa. however we where told that we would only get the cash payment back. where 3 of 4 of us paid by card! 

so we settles for 2 junior suits. which where basically 2 beds put into a room. we had to top up the already extortionate payment further.

moreover, the booking system failef to mention the ""local tac"" which was about 10% of the total.

the in house night club ""So""
is quite good - however very pricey drinks

swimming pool is ok , but th pool staff wheer4 terrible."
"We stayed at the Sofitel Lounge & Spa for two nights while in Marrakech. One thing to note is that the Lounge & Spa is the same hotel as the Palais Imperial (just different towers). While the grounds were very nice, the service was absolutely TERRIBLE. My husband and I had a horrible experience at the pool the second afternoon. We arrived around 2pm and after laying on our chairs for 45 minutes finally tracked down a waiter to get a food & drink menu. He came back 20 minutes later to take our order and we asked for a bottle of wine and scoop of ice cream. Another 45 minutes later he was nowhere to be found and we had not received our very simple order. I tracked down the pool manager and explained the situation and my frustration. He had another waiting come take care of us and he brought us an upgraded bottle of wine and some additional snacks which I assumed were on the hotel. As we were getting ready to leave we are hit with a bill charging us for a more expensive bottle of wine than we had originally ordered. At this point I was too annoyed to track down the manager again so just paid the bill and got out of there. The whole time we were there the service was awful, but this specific instance was the worst. Long story short, I would not suggest staying at the Sofitel. There are many other nice hotels around the area that I'm sure have much better service."
"Good location, good rooms and the hotel oozes class. Even the breakfast buffet is first class but if anyone values service, this place is terrible. The staff are snooty and don't care about guests. We ordered coffee at breakfast and were treated with disdain in the process. Then later in the evening, we ordered ice for our room, 5 calls later to the same person in guest services, 90 minutes later and we gave up. The attitude of staff makes staying here unpleasant and we cant wait to check out tomorrow and move to another hotel where perhaps guests are treated as guests."
"I just came here for some food and shisha but had to share mt experience. My initial impression of the hotel was great! Upon arrival the staff were very helpful and pointed me in the right direction. Once we got to the pool lounge my opinion of the staff changed completely. Disinterested and bored they took our order, forgetting it twice! Once the food came it was super bland and definitely not worth the money. Shisha was nothing special either and no one tended to it. We were super hungry so we are it anyway, which in hindsight I probably shouldn't have done! Upon returning to our hotel I started feeling a little unwell, only to experience full-blown violent sickness for a solid 15 hours after! Completely ruined my last night in Marrakech. I'm still not exactly sure whether it was the cheese or salmon that made me feel this way. In any case, will not be returning there and will definitely not recommend bar food there!!"
"My strong advice for anyone visiting this particular hotel is not to expect a 5star service. Some of the staff at check in are rude and not interested in resolving issues. Their attitude stinks. I asked to speak to a manger 6 times, he kept me waiting in the lobby for over a hour and was a no show. I have also been charged breakfast which was suppose to be included in the package. I have stayed in this hotel over 10 times and doubt I will ever go back. "
"The hotel was very beautiful and the grounds were well-kept, including the pool.  However, the service from the front desk and housekeeping staff was less than stellar.  First, we were assigned a room that was right next to an empty wing, which at first seemed nice since we were so exhausted from our flight and train ride from Casablanca.  However, that feeling was short-lived because the next morning, we heard power drill noises starting at 8 AM in the room next to ours.  It was a bit frustrating since we were hoping to sleep in a little bit after our long day of travel.  When we asked the front desk staff about switching rooms, we were told that we could only upgrade to a more expensive room rather than a similar room to ours.  They were very inflexible with our request and for the rest of our stay, we were woken up to loud noises at 8 AM.  Second, our hotel room was situated right next to one of the indoor/outdoor restaurants, which played loud music until 1 AM in the morning every night.  We asked the front desk staff whether they could ask the restaurant staff to turn down the music and they responded that they would take care of our request.  However, after multiple phone calls, the restaurant never lowered down the volume of the music, which meant that the front desk staff never actually ""took care"" of our request.  This was VERY disappointing since we couldn't get a full night's rest during our entire stay due to the loud music until 1 AM and loud construction noises starting at 8 AM.  Third, the housekeeping staff never bothered to refill our complimentary tea/coffee selections in the room despite repeated requests.  Finally, during check-out, the front desk charged us for additional mini-bar items that we did not use during our stay.  The front desk staff had a hard time believing us and made a huge deal about removing the additional charges despite our repeated statements that we were being honest about not using the additional mini-bar items.  I would not recommend staying at this Sofitel in Marrakech since the front desk and housekeeping staff do not make any attempt to resolve issues raised by their guests or care about improving the quality of guests' stay.  "
"The hotel was a total disappointment. The receptionist upon check out was rude. The rooms were a complete disgrace. Cannot be classified as ""luxury"" or even 5 star. Smells horrible. Not clean. Spa staff were unaccomodating"
"My wife and I arrived at this hotel with high hopes. We had saved for ages having promised ourselves a premium five star break, following a difficult couple of years in our personal circumstances. We booked a five star establishment believing that they would uphold the traditions of quality and service that one expects from a premier hotel however in so many ways we were both deeply disappointed and shocked at how inconsequential our needs were to the management and staff at The Sofitel Hotel in Marrakesh.

Arrival was ok, indeed we were sat down for a short while, our credit card details were taken, and our keys given to us. We were then escorted to our rooms with our bags. We had booked a suite, and this was available. Before we were able (or allowed) to go to the room a very effusive concierge started to tell us about excursions, however it was most unwelcome as we had been travelling all day, but he would not relent until he was finished. 

On arrival into the room we immediately noticed how dimly lit it was, in fact it was actually quite difficult to see anything in the main bedroom, but the loo and bathroom were satisfactory, despite many of the light bulbs being blown.

That evening we went to the first of several restaurants, and had a pleasant enough meal although this cost over 100 GBP and we only had soft drinks! So to bed, and to be fair we had a good nights sleep until people above started moving furniture at 5.00 am which was a rude awakening. It should be noted that the hotel has poor sound proofing and you can hear the televisions and conversations in adjacent rooms. Take ear plugs! We went down to breakfast quite late and were shown to a filthy table. It looked as if they had hosted a kids party. Because we had the temerity to arrive shortly before they closed, we were told in no uncertain terms to be quick, not much fun when breakfast for two as an eye watering £40 +. I felt humiliated and insulted.

We elected to book a trip with the concierge, but the price was now quoted in euros and he would accept only a cash payment, as he was clearly on some kind of commission, but what really got me was that the price had suddenly gone up by about £20 too. I paid without too much fuss believing that we all have to make a living but feeling slightly that the Sofitel had sanctioned a little stealing alongside their usual business.

That day we took lunch in the main restaurant, which was about £50 per head plus drinks. The food whilst ok did no warrant the price, although the oysters were a nice touch. In this restaurant the service was reasonable, and almost up to a five star standard, but not quite.

Next day we took our trip, but finding our host was quite difficult as the concierge who was so eager to take our cash was no where to be seen. We contracted very serious food poisoning on this trip so I would advise against eating lunch in the mountains, particularly at the venue chosen by the driver. On the positive side, our 200 euros bought us a well informed driver, a decent car and some interesting if 'contrived for tourists', excursions. Sadly he food poisoning laid us up for 3 days afterwards.

Whilst we had food poisoning we used room service. Of course this is always expensive, but the Sofitel really know how to to provide the least possible quality and service for the most amount of money. A burger and chips at over £20 and a waiting time of over an hour and a half. On top of the cost they charge an extra £12 tray charge making a burger over £30.

The next day I begged for some attention from house keeping but it was only after 36 hours and a threat to vacate the room that anyone arrived. We had rotting flowers, no water, stinking towels, no toilet paper, an empty mini bar, and no replacement coffee tea or milk. Frankly the house keeping service was laughable, I would expect better attention in Wormwood Scrubs prison.

 I am writing this just before we leave. Today, finally someone turned up to clean the room. The rotting flowers have been removed, and we have clean towels.

I should comment on reception too really. We were unable to use our phone, so I had to make my way down to the lobby to report the fault which was a good five minute walk. The male receptionist was disinterested and ignorant. Firstly he just ignored me when I arrived preferring to complete counting money and doing paper work. When I informed him of the fault, it took a little while for him to even recognise what I was going on about the conversation went like this-

Me- 'Hello, I need to report a fault on my telephone, I cannot contact room service.
Receptionist- 'you dial 24'
Me- ' Yes, I have tried that, but it doesn't connect
Receptionist- 'Its dial 24'
Me- I am sorry, you don’t understand, I can't get any kind of line
Receptionist- 'You try 9?'
Me- (now a little peeved) Yes, I try everything- nothing works, also there are no instructions either.
Receptionist- 'This in your room?'
me- (Lost patience now)- 'No, in next doors room'
Receptionist- No words just blank look
Me- 'Please, I am not an idiot- of course it's in my room and yes its actually not working
receptionist - (now deeply offended) 'I not call you idiot sir'
me- 'No but you are treating me like one now kindly send someone up....' turns on heals exit stage left in dramatic huff…..

This episode was pretty indicative of the typical two star service at what purports to be a five star hotel.

The week got little better. We felt generally ignored, poorly serviced and highly ripped off.

This hotel has a serous management problem. Clearly morale is low amongst staff, and there is no consistent or quality training at all.

We would never book this, or any other Sofitel or Accor hotel again."
"We wanted to relax and we were prepared for the high price but we read good things. We asked to get a day pass for the pool and this woman named Aziza helped us. She never smiled once, only when we asked if drinks were included in the price. She actually laughed in our face. She made up a price for us when we said we wanted to include lunch. Without lunch but was 500 and with lunch 700 per person. I guess she decides and if she likes you the price goes down. She never explained where to go, where and what time lunch would be served etc etc. The pools were ok, lunch buffet amazing but nevertheless that didn't make up for the rudeness of this woman. Suggestion for Sofitel: replace her as soon as you get the opportunity. Still pisses me off. "
"Back in October 2016 made online reservation through Accor website with a FLEXIBLE rate, then couple of days before the booking had to cancel, so sent email to Accor customer care BUT never received a reply to confirm the cancellation, then phoned the Hotel direct in Marrakesh and told them that I wanted to cancel my booking and they should send me email confirmation for this, again NEVEr received email confirmation.

I though I had done my bit to inform them of the cancellation but to my surprise and shock in January 2017 (3 months after the cancellation) they charged the FULL amount of the one week booking to my credit card.

Until today I am going back and forward with the Accor management to rectify the Hotel mistake and for them to reverse the charges but I am not getting anywhere.

basically the Hotel has taken the full amount of my booking even though I never travelled to Marrakesh and my booking rate was Flexible where cancellation was up to a day before the arrival date.

Its just ridicules."
"We're Platinum members, and arrived to be given the worst Jr Suite in the hotel (in a construction site, no view, ground floor, phone not working,....). When asked about upgrade or why they'd treat Platinum members worse than others, the next day, they changed us to another suite, which was excellent, with great views, etc.  Mgmt should plan for their Platinum members and not just assign the ""only room left"". We used the valet for the car, and one day drove off and parked the car near Jmaa El Fna, turned it off, only to realize the valet forgot to put the key in our keyless car. We had to wait until the hotel sent someone with our key to lock up the car and continue our tourism!  Again, disorganization, even though they do everything with a smile and aim to please."
"I am writing this as I go to bed on my final nice at this property. 

30 min to get a drink, never got ice we requested, and asked same guy for help five times in the week and always told me it wasn't his problem and to call someone else instead of figuring it out. I have traveled the world and this is the worst service I have ever had at a hotel of this level and it's not even close! The culture here is slow but this is to the extreme. They need to realize they are servicing people from Europe and the USA where it is expected to move faster the snails pace. Very frustrating!

The facilities are nice. The room is large, food is good, drinks are as expected, and pool area is very nice! 

If it wasn't for the service being as awful as it is I would have gave this place 4 stars."
"I booked for April 2017, in light of my previous experience with Sofitel. I received confirmation for 8 adult and 8 child while I did for 2 adult and 1 child (I have screen shots from reservation page). To be ale to understand and fix the problem I wrote to hotel. Hotel Marketing manager wrote back to me stating that this is NOT their issue! and I should contact directly with central reservation team that I did. After 15 min on international call they told me that they do not have access to my file and I should call Customer Service. I send a mail. No response for 3 days then I called them. After 10 min on the phone, agent told me that they do not have access to my file and I should call Hotel!

I wrote to hotel and asked how they intend to accommodate 8 adult and 8 child - if they have a room in that size. Still waiting for response.

If you really spend substantial time to fix any problem and spend time and money on the phone, feel free to book with Sofitel!"
"We are currently staying at the hotel. Have to say we are bitterly disappointed with the standard of the hotel which just isn't up to Sofitel standards. We have stayed in many Sofitel hotels and this one is frankly a joke. 
We have stayed in their so called Opera Suite which is supposed to be their best room. Suffice to say the rooms are outdated and the bathrooms are frankly bordering on revolting they are so old. The pool area is nice and the service is ok at best - there does not seem to be many members of staff who understand much English. It is advertised that they have a kids play area- they do not apart from an old plastic playhouse in a dangerous edge of the complex where chairs are stacked up and which looks like it's been there many years and I would never let my kids play in. 
The indoor pool we are not allowed to use with kids- would have been nice to have been told this before we booked given that the weather at this time of the year is sometimes a little unpredictable. 
Generally I would not recommend anyone to stay here. It is more like a 3* hotel nothing like what you will be used to if you like staying in Sofitel hotels!"
"We have stayed multiple times at 5 star international hotels but this hotel's service is below 1 star. 
The breakfast staff is completely incompetent! Every morning we had to order our coffee, tea and water multiple times because either they did not bring our order at all or brought the wrong drinks. The table was dirty as were the chairs. The staff just wiped the previous guests' bread crumbs with their hands from the table (missing half the crumbs around the table deco and the rest landed on the chair).
Also my wife's glasses were stolen from our room. My wife was 100% sure that she left them in the room however I convinced her to ask at the reception if they were found at the poolside (benefit of doubt). We requested to speak to the manager who indirectly called my wife a liar because we asked if they were found at the poolside therefore the glasses could not have been stolen from our room. We tried to follow up with the manager however she responded that they will not look further into the issue. We have more than enough money to purchase the glasses again but how the hotel reacted and dealt with our complaint is disgusting and disgraceful.
Also twice staff followed us after their shift ended to the city centre and tried to take us to stores (to earn commission) and did not leave us alone although we insinuated we don't want to buy anything.
I recommend everyone to stay away from this hotel if you are used to a decent service. Sofitel should train their staff better or not call them self a 5 star hotel.
If you only care about taking a couple of nice pictures and have a service expectation less than a hostel than this is the place for you!"
"So my husband and I are currently at the hotel and the only positive aspect of this hotel was the checkin experience. We arrived early and were able to checkin in within 20 minutes. 

However from there everything went downhill. The bed is so painful not the Sofitel standard I am used to (woke up with back pains everyday). And the service is the worst I have ever seen. No one really understands English, you pretty much wait 30 minutes for a coffee or a glass of water, which had to be re-ordered multiple times. The staff are super slow in restocking bread, cheese etc. If you ask them to bring you mint tea without sugar, they will bring it with triple the amount of sugar, there is no attention to detail or excellent customer service. 

The hotel staff follow you when you you leave the hotel to go to to the square, they approach and walk with you and try to get you into the their ""brothers Argan oil store"" to earn commission (this happened to us twice) exploiting hotel guests to make money on the side is absolutely disgusting and I pretty much see it as harassment. 

I will never come back here again. Sofitel should evaluate their standards and educate their staff on how to provide good service. Also, considering you call yourselves and international hotel chain, your staff should speak a basic level of English, not everyone is French! 

I do not recommend this hotel, stay in a cute riad that is way cheaper and offers you excellent service."
"What a nice hotel !!!
Lobby nicely decorated and room  also nice with enough space
Great breakfast with large choices 
Service score is below zero  One of the worst one that I experienced in my life
SPA and swimming room nice and well maintained "
"I just came back from a business trip to Marrakech. Stayed at the Sofitel, as I had good F&B experiences there.. I thought why not try the hotel... 
I wish I hadn't!!! 
Everything just went wrong!! As if they where trying to make this a bad experience:
1. Asked for a non smoking room, got a room stinking with cigaret smells!!!
2. Nights are cold this time of year in Marrakech. The balcony door just wouldn't close, I was freezing in the room!
3. Bathtub water wouldn't flash out... after a shower it was full..
As I arrived late, I just wanted to sleep and thought I would ask them to fix it the next morning.
Complained before going to my meetings, was promised everything would be solved upon my return..
Nothing was done...
Came back to the reception, the ""public relations manager"" overheard the conversation I was having with the front desk personnel, and he intervened, asking me to go back to my room, pack my stuff, and they would call me shortly to change my room.
No need to say, nobody called!!! Left next morning swearing I would never set foot in this crappy hotel!!
I strongly advise you to stay away!!!!
These guy are running an old hotel, and they don't have a clue what customer service is about!!!! "
"Stayed here with 2 friends.  My room was booked for a trade fair and my friends had a room booked via Expedia.  No problem with my booking but my friends were told their booking had been cancelled by their travel agent - only problem is that I am their agent!!
The situation was very poorly handled and they had to wait 4 hours for their room - after I contacted Expedia.
Wouldn't stay here again - not just because of the problem.  The rooms are tired - in need of refurbishment urgently.  Staff very nonchalant and arrogant.  Finally way too big for my liking, much prefer the smaller Riad experience in Morocco."
"The only redeemable aspect of this hotel is the location and the doormen.

The spa is overpriced and services are not very good. The hotel wants to charge you for every service. For example if you want to use the spa pool you have to pay. 

The room was not well maintained with stained carpets, non-functioning lights and many items broken or scratched. 

Do not stay here if you are looking to relax as there is a horrible wedding reception style band that cranks out the hits well past midnight every night. 

Marrakesh is wonderful this hotel needs to be avoided. "
"The hotel was generally very good... amazing staff and amazing facilities (pool/spa, etc.) but our room was not up to standard at all.

We stayed in the opera suite, room 410... supposedly the best room type in the hotel. Unfortunately, the number and nature of the issues were just not what I would expect from a 5 star hotel. 

First and foremost the toilet had an unbearable sewage-like stench coming from it which could be smelt from the hallway, it was so bad! 
Aside from this, we had issues with both showers in the suite as neither had working thermostats and we could not get a comfortable temperature for any reasonable amount of time... very frustrating! We also had other minor issues such as doors which would not close shut, a patio door to the balcony which would not lock, a jaccuzi bath which didn't work and a plug socket which literally fell off the wall, revealing bare electrical wires. I do understand that hotels of a certain age can expect to have a problem or two, but there was just so much wrong with our room that it was unacceptable.

To be fair to the hotel, they did try to resolve the problem by offering us a new suite (which we could not take as we had just too much to shift amongst other reasons) and they gave us complimentary breakfast after a bit of nudging.  The staff and management were excellent. For this reason, I give a 2 star overall rating rather than 1 star!
A room in a 5 star hotel from a luxury brand should just NOT be presented in this way."
"This hotel is one of the most expensive I have stayed at - not expected for Morocco. 

Our stay is being completely ruined by the nightly live music from the terrace bar outsider window )so loud it is clearly audible from our 4th floor room even with the windows shut).

Made worse by the poor standard (it's like karaoke).

Will not risk booking here again."
"Arrived at the Sofitel Lounge and Spa. Beautiful hotel reception and views onto a lovely pool area. We are a party of four women celebrating my sister's 40th birthday. The Lounge and Spa section of the hotel should be closed as the noise from the building works is awful. I moved rooms yesterday due to the loud drilling noise and overnight my sister' room had a group of rowdy men trying to get through the interconnecting door that wouldn't lock properly. They were moved to the only room available that is down a corridor that has no lighting  so you can't even see to open your door. They were woken by all the drilling and building works.
You can also hear the building work noise from the swimming pool area. Loads of pool side staff stood around but not interested in taking your drinks order. Had to walk over to the bar twice before we were able to order a drink.
So far the only positive has been the excellent breakfast.
Such a shame as we are only here for 3 nights and could be a fantastic hotel."
"Stay away. This is not a family oriented hotel. The minute they see you have a baby, they will place you in an isolated room with no view. We paid for a room with Atlas Mountains view, they said that only a room on the first floor was available. That room was dirty, it had a funky smell, a smell of dirt, cigarettes and hookah, simply filthy. It took us an hour to get checked in. The hotel is full of prostitutes. No ramp for strollers and handicaps. No value for the money, horrible customer services and unprofessional staff. Please stay away, there are much better hotels in marakesh."
"Ok folks, if you are up to all the selfies show off with a massive swimming pool, a fantastic building with a lot of marble looking polished stones and an amazing decor, this is the place.
The hotel design is fantastic, the breakfast abundant with wathever you feel like and there are so many members of staff present at all times everywhere, that if you sneeze there will be at least 10 people giving you a tissue.
If you plan to stay in for the night and sleep it's another story. We stayed at the room 375 which happen to be across the street from the infamous sky bar, that will play music so loud that even though the windows are closed, it feels like the party is in your room. We changed room after a couple of nights to the 93, after complaining of noise, which actually happens to be 2 floors below the initial one, and the so called sound proof, (which is part of the features on some booking websites) is inexistant or very very poor to say the least.
As a result, not only we still had the same sky bar crappy music to listen to but the upstairs neighbours as well on the top of things.
So the first night our upstairs neighbour brought a girl at 5h40 in the morning (but the only thing he managed was to sweet talk her and make her laugh a few times), the second night he came back with his mate a little bit after 6 and the third night, thank god, he only made some noise until 00h30 which was brilliant as it was 20 min after the bar next door stopped tge music. It was monday night though.
We stayed 5 nights and didnt have a single resting night which for 200€ a night in a 5 star hotel is pushing it big time."
"We used before to go to sofitel but since 2 years we didn't book there so we decided in Ramadan to try it again and i was the one who convince my husband but we were really disappointed ,the hotel is not anymore the same i'll give him max 4 stars and the service became unprofessional specially in the bar near the pool, they are so rude ...it's sad sofitel used before to be one from the best but now they should really review their stars and give a push to train the stuff more...anw it will be the last time and the price is so expensive for that level!!"
"Staying at this hotel for 10 days, this is going to be a very long 10 days. Service incredibly slow, ordered water at the pool yesterday still not arrived, asked for shade took 40 minutes. Breakfast this morning 30 minute wait for coffee. So much attention paid to the facade of this hotel you need to address your service issues. Stayed across the world in many five star hotels , this hotel needs to be re rated."
"Admittedly we stayed during Ramadan but that doesn't excuse the quality of service we received. This had nothing to do with the number of staff on duty but their collective ability to busy themselves doing nothing. I suspect that this will not be an isolated experience as it takes a lot of practice to be able to maintain your eyeline 2 feet over everyones heads. That is of course unless you are a ""VIP"" guest when the staff make no pretence about service your needs above the other guests. Shame that a short break in a lovely city at a hotel with good facilities was spoilt by the service level."
"My girlfriend and I booked a day pass, as we had heard great things about the pool here and wanted a relaxing afternoon. To cut a long story short we paid 800dhs for two day passes (£80), which was more than a nights stay in our hotel. We weren't given a receipt and got accused of stealing by a pool attendant, who made me walk around for 15 minutes and find the man who sold us our day passes to confirm that we weren't in fact trespassing. I then had to wait over two and a half hours for a bottle of water, after asking several waiters and making a complaint to reception. Finally when we came to leave we asked if there was a changing room we could use, as we wanted to get changed and showered and head straight to dinner, we were again kept waiting for half an hour. I then went back to reception to find out what was going on and they told me that courtesy rooms are only for guests. Only then after I completely lost it did they suggest that we could change in the spa changing rooms. We were really looking forward to visiting the Sofitel, but were so disappointed by our awful treatment. I'd say unless you're a guest, don't bother. We felt like because we were a young couple who had only bought day passes, no one cared about us or took us seriously. They only positive was a young pool attendant called Younes who did his best to look after us after we were initially left waiting over two hours for a bottle of water."
"We arrived and it took ages to get your room.
The rooms are dark and very dirty.  The beds so old you try to hide it to put some extra tin matrasses that son't fit and you almost role out of your bed. Breakfast is great., but overall it looks more llike a cheap MTV party hotel."
"Just to give you a little context, I'm a platinum at Sofitel, stayed at other Sofitels countless times. When I was checking out, my rental car had a flat tire. The valet manager offered to fix it, so we gave him money. He asked for more, so we gave it to him, thinking that was tip. When we came back few hours later, the valet manager was nowhere. This time, the valet asked for another tip. The bellman who initially brought my bags out refused to load my bags into the car (since he already got his tip) and sent another bellman, who now asked for another tip. I don't mind tipping for good service, but this situation was out of control. Now that I'm back in US, I see that my Sofitel account is not credited with my stay. I've emailed 3 times for the bill, so I can forward to the point program. No response. This is a totally routine request Marriott Courtyards respond in an hour. Skip the Sofitel, there are plenty of very nice riads, much better experience."
"We travel a lot and usually stay in better places so we can trully enjoy those few days when we can rest, unwind and relax. When you pay the higher price for the hotel, you expect better hospitality- well Sofitel at Marrakesh may disappoint you. 
Yes, the hotel is clean, the service is ok (although we had an unpleasent experience at the main reception- when asked for a previosuly offered a lowered price for the breakfast, we were told that they didn't have a note of that?! We found that extremely rude as they simply meant we were lying (!) 
The other thing is we wanted to lie down next to the infinity pool, which we couldn't understand why was completely empty, so we sat down on the chairs next to it. A member of staff approached us and said that we had to pay 400 MAD (28 GBP!) each to stay there! Was that a joke?!!!  It was a snobish and unpleasant place. "
"I travelled to Marrakech with my daughter for a long weekend. I have to say that there wasn't one day when something went wrong due to bad service. Day one:  on arrival we were met my rude reception staff.  It took at least 30 mins to check in and get a room key (even though there was hardly any other people checking in at that time). We were given a room worth a double bed having already paid for a twin room. We tried to call the reception from the room but the phone just rang and rang. We therefore had to go back downstairs, wait again for the rude reception staff and finally get a key to a room with twin beds. Day two:  our room phones didn't work so couldn't order room service. We asked for them to mend the phones and they didn't. We arrive back from an early dinner and my daughter wanted some ice cream and they said they had run out!  We also realised on our return, that our twin beds had been made into a double bed whilst we were out!  We had to wait until 11.30pm for someone to change the bed back. Day three:  still didn't mend our phones despite  asking twice again.  Again no ice cream (although in the hotel brochure they prided themselves on their ""butler"" service where they can arrange ""anything for you discreetly"" to ensure your stay is amazing etc). They finally mended the phones and we ordered room service for dinner to be bought to our room.  They failed to collect the empty table with left over food and we had to call them three times to collect the table before we could go to sleep. Day four:  started off with having to find one of the ladies that clean the room to get more Rolet roll, shower gel and cotton wall before we left the room .  Lunch around the pool - my daughters chicken kebab was raw and they refused to take it off the bill initially (had to speak to two different managers before they agreed to remove it from the bill). Day five:  ran out of sun tan cream and they refused to open the in hotel shop. Suggested I walk to the supermarket 10 minutes away to buy some. 

Please don't stay here. It really is absolutely dreadful. Not worth the money. The service around the pool is slow, the rooms need an overhaul and the drinks and food are ridiculously expensive."
"Since we arrive Ananita at reception was ineficient finding our reservation, and after 30 minutes she cleared the situation, she start taking care of other guest that had just arrived! INCREDIBLE ATTITUDE, not even an excuse! We went out for dinner and when we arrive at 11 pm the room lights didn't work, soooo after 15 minutes in the room phone and nobody answer I decided to go down to reception and found that it was time of changing the turn and they were just chatting between each other and doesn't take care of the phone, less for the guests! As I claimed the guy that was lwaving just took his note book and left and told me that he was not working anymore!!! And Mohammed that was now in charge just told me ""calm down I have just arrived and it's not my problem"" VERY GOOD ANSWER FOR A SUPPOSED FIVE STAR HOTEL"". After arguing they sent me a maintenance worker to my room number 340 that he just told me what I knew: thenlights are not working I will try to fix them! After 30 minutes, this is 12 am he hasn't come back again, maybe with this kind of service tomorrow I'll be lucky and receive that is supossed I paid for: GOOD ATENTION!! In few words: The hotel is nice in the building but personal has no idea how they have to treat the guests in a five star hotel! And by the way: no manager in duty available at 2 pm and either and less at 11 pm!! SOFITEL COUNTRY MANAGER WHERE ARE YOU.??"
"Stay at this five star hotel for my four day vacation, day 1 had my room changed because no heating leaking water and telephones weren't working took 5 hours to get me to a new room another 3 hours to sort out the bed in new room. Day two pool guys were only interested in serving a certain type of gender food was cold and staff lacking manners and an understanding of English. Day 3 went to breakfast came back to a pungent chemical smell in my room which kept me out for the whole day due to them laying new carpet in the room next and using adhesive to stick it down! Day 4 resting from the ordeal and couldn't wait to fly home."
"We went for lunch with a group of friends. We ordered 2 burgers, mine was way over cooked! the waitress did not ask me how I wanted my burger! we also had skewers and vegetables which were tasteless. Considering the premium price you pay when you eat at the Sofitel this was a very disappointing experience and probably the last visit. I have reviewed the car park as not free as you get harassed by the hotel valet to park your car which you then have to tip. I don't have an issue with tipping but I don't like when they make you use the service and tell you there is no space at the car park  to make you use the service. This is not the first time in Sofitel."
"Beautiful hotel and scenery, we  went for my husbands birthday and got Very bad service. Reception Made us feel very uncomfortable and unwelcome, the hotel restaurant kept on forgetting our order, and we couldn't wait to go back home 👎🏻 wouldn't recommend. "
"Sofitel, need to abandon this property if it wishes to maintain any thought of running reasonable hotels. The property built in 202, is so out of date it is beyond a joke. we had 2 rooms on the 3rd floor. Views were not good as they over looked the street. The balcony was ok, but as with the rest of the room about 10 to 15% too small. The lighting in the room is terrible. Probably one of the worst we have experienced. Who ever designed these rooms should be shot!
Furniture in the room is appalling. The quality and design is horrible. All needs to be thrown out and replaced with a better quality and design. All the cushions on the furniture in the room and balcony needs replacing as they have stains all over. A lot of space wasted. No coffee or tea making facilities and this is supposed to be 5 star. What rubbish. Lack of sockets. There is just 1 in front of the desk and 1 by the side of the bed. This of course is too few. Why are they not International sockets instead of European only. Any decent hotel would use such sockets. Not up to date at all.
Bathroom is also too small and only a shower within the bath. This is so dangerous and only should be in a 2 star hotel, if at all. The plumbing has some issues as the water goes from scalding to cold and back again. This shows an issue with the construction. The bathroom is dirty with damaged fittings, which could easily be replaced if the managers here cared at all.
The breakfast at MAD 250 (Euro 23) is to be avoided as it is rubbish.
As others have commented the staff are arrogant and totally inefficient - Colonial influence? who knows but this place is over staffed and reflects on a very weak management, who cannot train them.
The hotel doesn't really know what it wants to be, very strange layout in lobby, which makes no sense and there is no main focal point as there are 2 reception desks.
Even in the lobby, I have seen more than 12/14 staff just walking around doing nothing, over staffed with poor training.
Potentially this could be an enjoyable hotel, but with lack of service and low quality of fittings and equipment, 3 stars is what it should be. Management have said that renovation will happen in 2016. If it does it is 5 years too late."
"My wife and I booked this hotel for a 5 days stay, everything is lovely but someone forget to inform the gate keeper that not all African people are either the hotel singers or else, we were constantly asked this question which completely ruined our enjoyment, couldn't wait to get out at the end. Good hotel but rather short sighting hotel staff if you are other than caucasian. "
"4 stars 
1 star quality of service 
I actually lost my sport t-shirt while swimming in the warmed pool in the spa 
The staff denied that they found it 
I called the reception she answers me that some guests some times stool things looool that was the best jock to close 2015 lool
In the 2nd time there while check in the reception guy tried to stool 200 drhm extra money from me but I was already aware about it so 

The African guy in the pool lounge called OMAR is the best in the hotel staff 
 I'm not going back there smelly toilets n garden 
Horrible experience "
"we have stayed there for 3 nights from 22nd to 24th december in a group of 21 members and reached there from fes but to our surprise no porter was available for shifting our luggage in the room and allocation of rooms were made very late although we have checked at ard 6pm. i have been alloted a room with two single bed joined together when i asked for a king sized bed than they have made it italian bed which was discomfortable. in the room not provided any kettle and when requested no body understand english and when compained to manager she said sorry and solved any of my problem. when it is international chain than they must understand english and provide basis amenities in the room.in short very basic hotel with no services and beds were deshaped and discomfortable."
"We were travelling in a group of 20 people. Everything was horrible right from the check in experience. The staff at the reception were showing a lot of attitude. The bell boys asked us to take our own luggage. However, the person who took the cake was the guy staffing the concierge. He only seemed interested in selling certain restaurants and organising a day tour out of which he could earn commission. His writing was completely illegible and he had attitude which never seemed to end. The guy was extremely rude. The manager gave us an excuse that they are running quite busy. They certainly did not charge less. What a terrible excuse! That too coming from the manager of the hotel. Carpets in the corridors were stinky and shabby. Bathrooms date back to generations and one has to step into the tub to take a shower! Would definitely suggest avoiding. "
"Good points:
1. Checking in experience very smooth and comfortable and receptionist remembers guest names;
2. Breakfast staff all very polite with greetings;
3. Door man helped to sort out ridiculous taxi driver's last minute price change.
4. Lunch staff by the pool very good.

Not so good points:
1. Room lacks some basic amenities to be a five star hotel such as kettle, tea/coffee, body lotion, hifi system outdated doesn't work with iPhone 5 onwards and not at all with Androids, TV very cheap but that's not a big deal.
2. Concierge slightly pushy with tours when not asked for.
3. First floor restaurant Orangrie newly decorated and smells of paint, staff rude, food and drinks very expensive and next to no guests dining there it's a bit of a ghost place and after complaining no result. It seems that it's outsourced so hotel can't do much about it....
4. Breakfast lacks meat selection and quality. It's basically a continental breakfast with a few Moroccan fairs mixed in, at 25 euro per person you'd expect more. 
5. Breakfast staff insisted to put napkin over my lap felt a bit too much service. 

2. Poor choice in the mini bar"
"Credit cards hold some cash..next checkout morning they charge did not reflect amount held thus paying extra in cash. Buffet was not really a good value..lobster was less than sparse the rest was mostly desert..."
"I have been staying at the sofitel for 3 days now. So far I have changed room three times, the first because myself and my husband were given separate beds, the second because we were placed in an 'upgrade' located directly above the niteclub and now in the third which is in the older part of the hotel overlooking the pool, it's absolutly lovely. All of this is fine except when I tried to change rooms I was left on hold for what could have been forever because the guy on the phone had no intention of helping. Met a differerent staff member at the desk who was very helpful. Next day we went to the gym, I wanted to use the pool and my husband the gym, that was lovely, when we went to leave we were met by an employee who very rudely let us know that the pool is not free to use, strange as it is located directly beside the gym and I was led into it by another member of staff. Again that would be fine, a simple mistake, but the attitude of the staff member was terrible, his behavier made us both feel very uncomfortable, just not what you'd expect from a five star. I have been to Marrakech many times and am used to the 'you take you pay extra' attitude that has come from an abundant tourist trade but I have also stayed in much nicer hotels such as la Mamunia, where the staff will bend over backwards to ensure you enjoy your stay. Considering that is a 5 star hotel, based on nothing but it's hospitality I would give this hotel 2 stars. You'll know what I mean if you do end up staying here. "
"That hotel might be nice from the outside but from the inside its just pure chaos !

1. No recognition as Platinum member
2. House keeping not respecting normal hotel standard before entering room
3. No action when complain about strong smell was reported
4. F&B understaffed 
5. Little or no English 
6. After complaining to guest relation and writing to them again when I was back in Switzerland no response 

I have asked for a copy of invoice which is apparently to difficult and I am being transferred to front desk, accounting, reservation, pool bar etc

I hope Accor will start to do some mystery evaluations and some brand standard as this is not acceptable 

Regards
Peter Hvidberg "
"Very rude, condescending staff at the reception desk - the worst welcome we experienced in Morocco in a 3 week driving holiday. Arriving at 1:35 pm I was told coldly to ""sit over there and wait for your room (for 1 1/2 hours!!!!) and that I had no right to complain until after 3 pm when a room should be ready for me"". Nothing in my booking indicated that I had to sit travel weary in the lobby until 3 pm before I could freshen up or change into more appropriate clothes or a swimsuit. Surely not all people checkout at 3pm or that absolutely no rooms are ready until miraculously at 3 pm every room is suddenly ready and absolutely all new guests checking in are then at the same time to be assigned rooms.There were several other disappointed women standing around waiting besides me but no one on the staff deigned to acknowledge this or to attempt to make them feel more comfortable.  Definitely not 5 star hotel behaviour that we have ever experienced before.

There were only 2 positives with staff: first was a young man (from a village outside of Tetouan who has retained the good manners he was taught as a boy) who served welcome tea and 2nd was Jahine who interceded to get us into our room once she became aware of my angry face. BTW, the room was in fact ready and waiting for a new guest!

Staff throughout the grounds were stressed and snapping at each other while serving lunch (very slowly!) around the pool. Where, by the way, arriving at the pool we asked for pool towels which never arrived and the storage location was not visible so we could obtain them ourselves.  Fortunately we could drip dry from the sun after our brief dip in the freezing cold pool.

Our Luxury Double Room was comfortable but very plain and awkwardly configured, much less appealing than any of the Riads we stayed in. 

The terrible welcome put a damper on any pleasure we might have had with the opulent setting; we just wanted out of there, so we took all our meals and drinks elsewhere."
"Unfortunately I had forgotten I had stayed here before and how poor it was. Here are a few pointers from my recent stay:

I wanted a meal or snack just before I went out to work at 6 pm. I was told to have room service (room service costs an extra 150 MAD or £10) or have food in the reception area but it would take at least 30 mins or if I wanted I could go outside the hotel. It was not the fact that it would take 30 mins ... it was the attitude of the staff.. Take it or leave it !!!

At the same time I noticed that the staff had monkeys on leads on the outside bar area, actually on the bar when no guests were around. I had eaten lunch served from the same area earlier.

On the first morning I came down to reception. At the time staff were arguing between themselves and I had to interrupt them to ask where I could get breakfast.

Throughout the stay the staff were rude and unhelpful.

My advice ... Do not stay here.  There are many better hotels in the same area."
"We were able to get a reservation last minute as we changed our original itinerary. This luxury hotel is beautiful but: the toilet did not work well, the shower did not drain well (we stood in 3 inches of water while showering), the hair dryer barely had a breeze and another in the closet did not fit any plug, there was trash outside our balcony, a cabinet did not close all the way, the luggage rack was worn and, worst, there was loud music outside our window from an event at the hotel. I called the desk at about 8 pm and was told it would be taken care of and the woman would call me back. She did not. An hour later I called again and was told it would end at 10 pm. It did not. They finally ended the party at 11 pm. Considering the prices and the Sofitel reputation, this was really inexusable. (We had checked in and undressed and showered and were there for only one night which is why we did not request another room.) When we came down to breakfast, I gave a list of the problems to someone at reception and said that I think they should give some consideration to reduce the bill. Didn’t happen. The breakfast was great, though. I would not recommend this hotel."
"Unexpected things happy but the service and how staff responds to such occurancr is what defines a 5 star hotel from the rest. After a long day of travelling all i wanted was to freshen but alas No water in hotel and worse yet no toilet facilities. No alternative arrangements and staff who don't communicate or worse don't know what to do. Asked for bottled water so I could at least wash my hands but slow or rather no response. Eventually found a helpful member of staff but really service geberally wasnt up to scratch. Dissapointing start to what was meant to be a birthday treat. Had to go along to a local restaurant to freshen up. Unacceptable and really a big let down. "
"I regret that this was easily the worst Sofitel hotel we have visited, and as an Accor gold member I have experience of quite a few.

The check-in was poor and no welcome drink was offered. Our initial suite was next to a noisy road with no view (an Atlas view was booked). After complaining we were eventually upgraded to a Palace suite, but a this should have been done automatically with Accor club gold status.

The overall service level was appalling. Many staff are poorly trained and have no interest in serving guests. On one occasion we walked from the pool to the main reception and saw a total of eleven staff talking to each other and not helping guests. Staff at the pool were the worst. No towels were offered, vacant sun beds were not cleared of dirty towels, and the hotel policy of allowing outside guests to use the pools made it difficult to find sun beds.

Ordering drinks in any bar was an endurance test, with waiting times of 20-40 minutes before a simple glass of wine arrived. 

The main a la carte restaurant was closed with only a fraction of the menu available in the alternative restaurant.

The concierge failed to efficiently organise a guide for us to the old town and could not answer basic questions about Marrakech..

On the plus side food service at the Oasis poolside restaurant was efficient, as was breakfast.

I asked to see a senior manager to complain but was told that there was no one available. No member of the management team subsequently tried to contact me.

This poor state of affairs is the responsibility of management who need to improve standards so that the hotel is worthy of the Sofitel name. Perhaps the management team should visit the Sofitel at Essaouira where service and other standards are excellent."
"The pool and breakfast are great as is the location and ambience.  If you require something done in your room, don't expect it to happen.  We asked for 2 extra towels and they have yet to arrive despite calling housekeeping and stopping at the desk twice.  Turn down service is not regular and they do not provide washcloths.  Finally, we reported the volume on the TV was not working.  One might assume this was something that could easily be attended to....not so.  We asked to speak to the manager and left after waiting almost 10 minutes when told he would be right with us.  I am guessing there are better hotels in the area that really deliver 5 star service.  We are here for 4 days and 3 nights and are disappointed."
"I stayed at the Sofitel lounge & spa for 2 weeks. Average to be fair, the only good points are the pools & sky lounge bar. Not five star!! I found some of the clientele a bit odd, you need to experience it to understand. The staff are ok but needs refining, I appreciate the assistance from Atoul, Marie-Helen. Don't get view to the streets the noise is a nightmare. The place is great if you want to party (club next door) hence the attraction from a more dodgy clientele. The area is good, I would stay again in the same area but not the Sofitel. Sorry! Lovely boutique called Max & Jan (spent a fortune!), nice staff! Strange vibe overall, I think the owner needs some work!

"
"I had a cocktail with a friend on the terrace, after my friend left I odered a glass of white wine, after 20 min I did not received a thing, could not even get the attention of the waiters I had to get up and ask for my bill. It is such a beautiful  detting just a pitty the service does not match"
"I would advise people not to stay at this hotel or any Accor branded hotels. We planned a Easter getaway and made a reserve payment when we arrived. We then settled up when we finished our stay and it transpired that they charged us twice (c.€1,000). We thought they could refund this easily but this has not been the case and after 5 months of correspondence they have been unable to refund us the money despite saying they would do so. I have stayed at a number of Accor hotels in Mauritius and Paris and this is the last time I am going to use them. 

The lack of customer service and attention to detail indicates they are behind the curve and there are many other hotels that would love to have my business and those of others. I did not want to have to make as post but it appears the only action and so that I can warn others. Hopefully they will learn from this experience."
"I'll start by saying this is the most comfortable hotel I've stayed in, the beds are hard to leave behind the loungers at the pool are fab, plenty of shade if you want and the staff at the pool are brilliant.  It's easier to communicate if you have some french, but I found this to be the case all over Marrakesh. 

On arrival we went through the usual check in process my friend was asked for a card and handed over her visa debit card.  She was then handed the keypad and told to enter her pin.  It was only after noticing a guy beside us questioning in the amount that we checked.  The staff had preblocked 10,000 dirham on her card (roughly 1,000 euro) I questioned this amount I was told it was standard and we were staying for such a long time 10 days I don't think is so long.  I argued the case  and was told if i wanted to run a cash account i could so we agreed and they reversed the charge on my friends card.  5 days later she checked her account and noticed the money hadn't come back onto her account.  Se called her bank who said that as Morocco isn't set up for visa debit the money had been refunded to mastercard and it would take 30 days for her funds to be freed.  Luckily her bank are helpful and said if we send an email to the bank from the hotel they will clear the block immediately.  Simple enough request.  It took 24hrs and 5 requests, we wasted nearly a full day sitting in reception asking for this to be done, only for it to be done wrong 3/4 times.  Eventually it was done correctly the next day.  

On checking out we made use of the courtesy room which is a great facility but there was 2 of us and 1 towel.  we requested towels 4 times and still ended up with none.  

The hotel itself is lovely.  It's expensive but most hotels are.  €5 for a can of coke and €20 burgers.  The staff let it down and didn't handle what should have been minor problems very well at all."
"I am a sofitel fan and an accor platinum card holder. Have been a regular client of sofitel Marrakech for years but really have to say have been truly disappointed by the quality of the food which has become really appalling. And totally overpriced : for example 40 eur for a very average risotto with 3 shrimps. It seems the management does not care as most of the clientele is local and values other elements of the hotel such as the garden and location. At a minimum of 300 eur per night (closer to 400eur for high season) they are now far better options around such as the four seasons. I have decided not to go anymore as i cannot see any value for money"
"We have been here for 3 days and 2 left, keeping thinking it cannot get worse... Well it can! We spent 3 days at essaouira's Sofitel and the difference in services is disconcerting.

Welcome was impersonal and cold - no welcome drink or quick tour of the hotel which we had in essaouira. 

Room is ok but on small side. Bed however is very comfortable.

Breakfast buffet is nice and varied, however waitresses are unorganised and clearly not trained. You can have 3/4 dealing with the same table and it s simply a waste of time. It seems there is a lot of ""supervisors"" doing nothing but blowing hot hair.

Food is good and pricey but not more than any other 5 stars; however it is a bit much for the drinks. The hotel being in central Marrakech, there are plenty of restaurants around.

Swimming pools are good sized but the area looks stuffy as there are too many beds/ lounges for the area size. However it is always full so they are indeed needed. People not renting a room can use the pool for a fees (700dhr I think) however you can frequently see one of the pool team letting pp stay for a much smaller fees (handshake with a note is NOT discreet). This is an issue for the management however letting pp using the pool when there are not enough beds for the clients seems not well thought. Again staff is not organised/trained and have had to ask to signed the receipt more the once when food/drinks was served a while before. This is again an issue for the management as they cannot charge the client without the signed receipt.

Noise, the hotel has a club and hotel is quite noisy when it closed down at around 4/5 in the morning. It took at least 45 mm for security to come and deal with a naked woman yelling for  the police while trying to jump over her balcony. When I called the reception, I was told security had been sent and was hung up on. Apparently, politeness and excuses were too much too expect.

On the good side, one of the door man was really helpful when we had an issue with a taxi. Some taxis will try to charge you more because you are a tourist and even more so when staying in a 5 stars hotel. My husband being Moroccan, we have not had much issue like this as he knows the tricks and speaks the language but please be sure that the taxi use his meter. The door man came to help and informed the driver that he has his licence number and police will be called if he keep asking for 150dhr for a 20dhr drive. Reminding him that by law he must use his meter.

This will be my first and last stay in this hotel.

"
"Facilities are pleasant. we enjoyed the 3 swimming pools and had lunch every day by the pool . Food and staff are ok though over priced .  Rooms were tiny and frankly quite old  , the corridors look also poor maintained for a Sofitel. However the worst of all was the guests staying at the time at the hotel. Please avoided take your kids, teenagers or parents there. A big shock "
"On a whim, I decided to spend the weekend in Marrakech and ended up booking at the Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial. The hotel is conveniently located within a short taxi ride from the Medina and Gueliz. Whilst the Sofitel has potential, it is let down terribly by complacent management and aloof staff members who virtually acknowledge no guests in passing.

The public areas and the guest rooms look worn and neglected. Room Service trolleys with dirty dishes idle for hours in the guest hallways. Ordering a cold beer at the Pool Lounge requires getting up twice to obtain the attention of the staff members nearby who were engaged in socializing among themselves.

Offerings at the breakfast buffet are adequate, yet the joy of a leisurely breakfast is inhibited by staff members who could care less about guests. Chefs and Waiters can be observed sitting on couches inside the restaurant chatting and playing with their mobile phones. An order for an egg white omelette was met with a sigh and rolling eyes. A humble request for more hot water was met with a sneer.

There are plenty of choices in regards to comfortable and enjoyable accommodation in Marrakech. Avoid the Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial at all cost as it is anything but “manifique”!"
"I have just returned from Marrakesh yesterday evening after a 4 night stay with my girlfriend at Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial.

We had high expectations after carefully selecting a hotel we associated with a luxury chain.

On arrival we were delighted with the look and feel of the hotel. We were informed that our room was available early as the hotel was quiet. We were also given some delicious complimentary Moroccan tea. We thought fantastic, what a great start to our holiday. Things were looking perfect.

On booking our stay, we upgraded to a luxury room, mountain view. 

On entering our room, we were immediately disappointed. The room was dirty, the carpet worn, stained and had clearly not been vacuumed since the last occupant. This trend carried into the bathroom and toilet too. This was not 'luxury' in any sense. The decor was dated, a loose plug socket was a clear sign that little attention is payed to detail. How can this justify a high price point, be described as luxury and be rated 5 star?  There was also a pill of some sort next to the bed, we did not have to look hard for this!

Going back to our room upgrade (Mountain view). We expected to see the Atlas mountains in the distance, the only view we had was of the main road. I politely asked reception in which direction could I see the mountains. English was a language barrier but I was told that I can not see the mountains from my room. I proceeded to ask if I had been given the correct room... I was told yes sir, but you can't see the mountains. The conversation was not going far or developing as we had expected so we decided it was in our best interest to relax and let this go. 

OK, lets just get on with it and enjoy the rest of our stay. We don't like to push things or complain... 

Onto the second day of our stay, it was late afternoon and no one at this point had been into our room to make the bed, change the towels and we had run out of toilet paper, of which we had 2 tiny very poor quality rolls. We informed reception who without delay gave us our fresh towels and toilet paper. Quests are also supposed to get a turn down service, we had this twice in 4 nights.

To throw in some possessives and be out of tempo, the pool and surroundings were  fantastic! Actually all quest areas with the exception of our bedroom were comfortable. If the hotel were rated on these areas, it would be pushing for a 5 star rating.

Staff: A few were helpful, polite and smiled... It was a challenge to get any kind of service most of the time, I don't know if this had anything to do with our visit coinciding with Ramadan, but looking at other reviews it doesn't. In fact, on a few occasions I felt the staff to be rude. One instance, I had gone into the pool, left a towel and sunscreen on a bed, coming back it had been cleaned away. I asked the pool attendants after they finished their conversation with each other who could be found sitting down in there own private area as usual if they had seen my sunscreen, but they could not understand me or speak English. Funny, the next day they could understand a more complex conversation with my partner and I...

On our last day, we decided to treat ourselves to a very expensive Ceaser Salad by the pool. I had some very moldy sun dried Parmesan cheese. The server was helpful and informed the manager. I did not get an apology, just a tiny glass with some fruit put on the table. I took this as the best I was going to get so made no fuss.

I'm going to cut to the end. On checkout, we reviewed our huge bill for very little. Apparently we had used the mini bar and drunk more than we thought on the last evening. I firstly queried the mini bar and explained I had not used it. The man who's name I wish I had taken raised his voice at me at which point I had to leave before I got angry and let my girlfriend finish the checkout. We did have the items from the mini bar removed from our bill, but did get charged for drinks we did not have. You don't get receipts with your order in this hotel so without writing everything down, it's hard to track.

I will be writing to Sofitel in the near future and I will be pushing for a refund on our 'Mountain View' upgrade and for some of the drinks that we did not enjoy but pay for.

It's a shame I feel compelled to write so negatively about my holiday, but we did enjoy Marrakesh itself, some of the staff  and the hotel pool, just not the rest of it."
"This is the first negative review I've written. I won't even due to space and interest include all the issues we ran into during this trip.
Like most hotels they take a swipe of your credit card upon arrival. Here it is a hefty 3000mad (£208). On checkout day I was advised that this
fee was un-required and would therefore be refunded. One week later I checked my account and there was no refund. I telephoned the hotel and was
advised that the refund had been made and it was the credit card companies fault and to wait at least ten days for the credit to appear. Ten days later still
no refund so I telephone once again. I am told that the refund has once again been made and that they will email me the receipt as some kind of proof. I have never received any emails. This is now in the hands of my credit card company raised as a dispute claim.

We had numerous issues with the hotel during our stay. firstly the TV and hairdryer did not work. I reported the TV as a fault four times over two days
and at each time was informed it would be dealt with asap. Funny thing is on two of those occasions the reception clerk didn't even ask for my room number. I had
to suggest to them that said room number would prove useful to the engineer. On the fifth occasion I asked to speak to a manager which I did. Thereafter the TV was fixed. There was also a faulty light in the room, due to the above I couldn't be fussed about reporting.

If your looking for speedy service as regards to drinks whilst hanging out in any of the lobby/reception/bar areas. forget it. it'll be quicker to go to the bar directly. Service in the bars is poor v's their excessively high prices.

Elements of the hotel are fine it's just so let down by extremely poor service & we had other issues to, just can't be fussed to re live them here. I'm done, over to
the credit card company to get my funds back and they say this is a five star hotel. I can assure you having stayed in many it is not."
"When you book a room in  5 stars you feel it will be the best ! Unfortunally it s started badly first we booked a car to pic us at the airport because our flight will land late in yhe night...no car ..then my room was nt available because they can t find my booking so they asked my credit card...( i paid before never done it s my first and last time i did) so the reception who wasn t kind at all gave to me a room at graund floor ...noisy and dark....now i will ask for a n other room...let s see
Breakfast in a big room ...lots different kind of meals...lots people working i wait too long just for hot lemon...may be to simple for them, i will continue my report at the end of my holydays at the moment i would like just to run away!!!!"
"If you don't speak French, don't come here. Upon check in, they asked us to wait and sit by the couches, and they will bring tea. No tea came. 30 minutes later I noticed they were checking in people that came after us. I asked if we could check in, and we waited 30 more minutes. We arrived to our room, where we had 2 twin beds,  though we paid for 1 King. You won't notice the difference they said. I think I would notice my husband in a different bed on the other side of the room from me. Despite requests for help with other things (getting chairs by the pool, issues with flights, getting coffee), not once were we helped or even paid attention to. Francophones are fine, but if your native tongue is English, find another hotel. The pool is beautiful, though."
"Turns out we are not riad people so chose to spend some time at Sofitel instead! 
Paid 400dirhams each for standard guest pool access, 500dirhams for luxury guest pool access.
Go for standard until they clean the infinity pool!!
Have to disagree with others re pool staffing comments, staff in both areas were fantastic both days! Couldn't do enough to help especially today in luxury!
However there ends the positives.

Infinity Pool today was dirty, stones / debris on the pool floor, green mildew where the wall meets the floor and the water smelt foul. Might be imagining it but ears are already starting to hurt, hope to god the water's not given me an ear infection.
Young girl yesterday said they are learning re luxury area and would appreciate comments, big comment from me is clean the infinity pool!!

Food and drinks good both days but crazy Sofitel prices. 

Looking round the whole hotel needs a spruce up. Dead plants hanging off the walls, bird poop everywhere and dirty stains down the walls. 

Reception area and main pool area good, just don't look up!  Definitely not 5 star luxury."
"You have to wait an hour just to complete check-in transactions. The receptionist told us to make ourselves comfortable and they will come to check us in however we waited 50 minutes just to be noticed. Very very bad service overall, I do not recommend this hotel at all..."
"So many things went wrong that I don't even know where to start.
Pictures are worth 1000 words... A bathtub that didn't drain, a dead ant on the towel that was there the whole week, people coming into my room after midnight, apparently staff staying over, drunk.
No apologies, no solutions, no nothing. And like other guest mentioned if you don't speak French no one makes any effort to help you."
"In summary this hotel could be amazing, however it suffers from the worst service ever, this is made even worse by the expectations of Sofitel's and the experience which we all expect. 

The hotel itself is in a great location. If you are looking for a really nice hotel with a great pool to relax this has it, it is also a perfect distance from the main town for wandering in. 

As mentioned though the service is appalling. The pool staff do not get you drinks, or if they take your order will forget. The restaurant staff ignore you, the bar staff will just walk past you, the reception staff will refuse to help and housekeeping do not bring towels

Even the simplest things are a challenge, for example I am an Accor member and have stayed in Sofitel's around the world, normally all my points are credited to my account. However despite asking them 3 times to ensure I was credited, they managed to loose my member details each time, still to this day I am waiting for this to be resolved as they didn't invoice me correctly. 

I would recommend this hotel, however if you are used to Sofitel quality - you have been warned, it carries the name but not the associated service."
"I stayed there on my last trip this march.
The location is great, it's about 10 mins walk to reach that famous big market, 10 minutes taxi to their biggest mall, and about 15 mins taxi to other famous attraction.

But then, 

1. I got the upgraded room, the one that have a balcony facing the mount atlas, when i got to the room, i found (lots of) birds poo on the balcony's floor. i can't even listen the guy talking about how beautiful that mountain is all i can think about is lots of disinfectant and a mop to clear out that mess 

2. The upgraded room i got surprisingly didn't provide a single toothbrush, so i asked on from the room service, our room was located at the 5th floor near the house keeping room, and i assume 15 mins is enough to deliver the toothbrush. But i'm wrong, call them again after 30 mins and wait for 30 mins more, yet no toothbrush appeared. I went and knocked on the housekeeping room, no answer (surprise surprise) then i go down to the reception, and the not so helping receptionist (read detail on point number 3) is just telling us to wait, they made a few call after i said ""i'll wait here until i got my toothbrush"" then the toothbrush drama ends

3. Most of the staff , specially the receptionists and won't consider you a human being unless you speak french. They'll talk to other french speaking customer WHILE you're not done with them, or sometimes, answering a phone call WITHOUT saying sorry to you WHILE you're not done talking (if this a local culture here, then ignore this point)

4. The breakfast doesn't have enough option for a International Hotel, there are four section and 3 of them are just sweets, cake, more sweet, more cake, and more sweet pastries. You can't even find any single bacon, come on! breakfast? without bacon? (lol) but seriously, you need to work on that breakfast menu, not everyone can eat only sweets in the morning

5. The most terrible part is, on the last nigh of my stay, the aircon on my room broke down, called the room service, in 15 mins. a technician come (if i know this i'll call the technician to bring me toothbrush, lot of faster, lol) after 10 mins of cleaning the aircon, the technician done with his work. I realized after 20 mins that the room is still hot as hell, then i called them again, and they say they'll send another technician, that didn't appear after 20mins waiting, so i went down, AGAIN
The only explanation they have is ""the whole building having the same problem"" but yet, i feel cold in the reception area (nice work at lying there gal!) so i said ok then i'll sleep in your lobby then!
Now they change their answer that ""the problem is at the 5th floor"" (getting clever honey, but not working for me, your building your problem not mine)

After i said i have a morning flight to catch and didn't have time for this right now, they offer us another room at 3rd or 4th floor i forget, and that room's ac is FINE (eat that problem is in the whole building reason!)

So, yeah! i guess the hotel's staff loves you so much that every single request you made requires you to go down to the receptionist and talk to them, off course if you speak french they'll respect you more, too bad i'm just Indonesian that barely speak english.

once again, i'll repeat my title WORST. SOFITEL. EXPERIENCE. EVER"
"Iam a loyal customer of Accor for several years and by far, unfortunetly Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial did not meet my expectation
it was great start actually, as they gave me an upgrade to one of their suite because of the membership
but then i felt like most of the staff dont really show warm gestures in the hotel
exception for warm folks in L""Oasis and Le Jardin
Breakfast could use more international menu
but thats all acceptable
Even bird dirt all over in our balcony

whats not is when they had problem with their AC that caused a hot room from afternoon
we asked for technician but the problem remain still
around 10pm we went down to ask the problem to receptionist and ask for a room change since we need to take a rest and prepare for early flight
they acknowledged that theres a problem with the AC and say no need to worry because tomorrow the AC will be back normal
so how could an international hotel give a response as easy as that and ask us to wait until tomorrow morning?
they finally gave a new room only  when told constantly that we have morning flight

earlier, as housekeeping didnt give us toothbrush and paste, we literally called receptionist for 3 times, go to housekeeping room by ourself and promised for toothbrush in few minutes
we waited for more than an hour and finally decide wait in front of receptionist until they give us a simple toothbrush
its pretty much frustrating

when asked about their jogging track, concierge constantly say that it was outside, it was inside, it was outside, it was inside 
how could you not know your own hotel?

and one thing i do miss from Sofitel Marrakech Palais Imperial is a simple ""Bonjour"" and smile 
which is rare in our 4 days stay here"
"Third stay at this hotel. But disappointing experience this time around. 

The negative experience started when I checked in. Although I specifically asked for a non-smoking room, I was given a smoking one. Given that all rooms in that aisle had a garden access, apparently all the rooms on that side were evidently for smokers. Which I only realized when, after asking several times to get a new room, I was moved to another room, again for smokers!

Then a day later , I left a cup of coffee on a bed table before leaving the room at twelve. The cup was still there while my bed had been done. 

I found the staff quite unresponsive as evidenced by the following:

- you're passing by three members of the staff chatting by a door and none of them hold the door for you
- it took me four calls and 60 minutes to get two bottles of water that had been replaced when the room was made earlier. 

Compared to the first two stays, I found a lower level of service quality. I'm not sure that I will go back there."
"I stayed at this so-called 5-star hotel because I wanted to get pampered and have a comfortable room... Well do not expect anything fancy. The rooms would barely make it to 3 stars in the rest of the world; bathroom is tiny and no working hair drier, the room itself is aged and the carpet looks old and dirty. The bed is ok but nothing yo brag home about... As for the spa, I was so disappointed in my massage (a woman... No make masseur) after she basically suggested that since I wasn't married we could do something else.... Hello?!?!? In a 5-star hotel?!? When I complained in the morning about the terrible tv qualify (all channels were staticky and so was the sound) I was told they were sorry and I should write to the hq.... They basically couldn't care less! Insane 
They got me once but won't get me twice "
"We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights and from the moment 'go' it was trouble! Took 1 hour and 10 minute to check in. We were offered no food whilst waiting even though we told the woman at reception that we are very hungry and fed up! We were told to wait or have a look around the resort while they try and trace the booking! By the time we got the room we were shattered, infact they ruined our plans because we were so tired, hungry & put off!
Got into the room and bathtub was filthy and iron wasn't working. Asked for a new iron and housekeeping came to drop it to us.. knocked and within 2 seconds of knocking walks straight into the room! 
Another time we had house keeping walk into our room after a single knock, again walking in after literally 2 seconds! We had the sign on 'do not disturb!'. 
Towels had lipstick stains on it. 
Our balcony door was left TWICE open by housekeeping. Sink was blocked, housekeeping fixed it. Next day it was blocked again! 
We asked for a wake up call on night 2 and no one called, we almost missed breakfast. We had 30 mins to get ready and go down and eat!! We ignored it. Day 3 we asked for a wake up call and explained that 'we didn't get it the night before so please make sure we get it today'.
Day 3 and no wake up call. We ended up missing the breakfast completely!
We were offered free breakfast by manager, but it's not the same as the buffet we paid for? It was our last day at the hotel and the day's plans were ruined and wasted because we woke up late due to no wake up call!
We were offered a lunch & shisha by manager, which is fine but it doesn't compensate for the amount of money we spent on the hotel and within the hotel during our stay, we had the suite and spent extra for this as it was a special occasion. The staff service was slow. A lot of the times they were just talking among themselves or on their phones. Once we stood at reception which was empty with only 3 staff members. We stood waiting for them to finish talking and laughing around. It took them 4 minutes to acknowledge that we were even stood there!!!

Overall the hotel has potential, lovely location, all facilities are available. Beds are comfortable and there is a good choice of breakfast and food overall throughout the hotel restaurants. Its a shame that the service was sooo poor that we would never recommend the hotel or go back."
"We are seasoned world travelers and highly acustomed to 5 star and luxury hotels. Our last experience at the Sofitel, Marrakech was the worst experience with hotel management ever. I would like to single out the Hotel General Manager, Mr. Benkirane.  We have tried to talk to him for 8 days regarding issues we were having with our stay at the hotel. We were never able to!!!! He and His staff kept on lying and giving excuses including calling us at 10:30 at night to schedule an appointment that never materialized. 

A 400 euro a night hotel management should be a bit more attentive to client needs.  Let me start with the room, we reserved a suite to find out it is just a room to be exact 40 square meters with a Bathroom that has not been renovated since perhaps  the 90's and water temperature that can not be maintained so the water can run hot and cold when you least expect it. The sink faucet water never got very hot. You have to turn the shower on first then the faucet for water to get hot. The carpet had spots and was not even vacuumed some days. The sliding door to the balcony did not close, luckily we were on a high floor so risks were limited. 

The furniture was cheap and absolutely not fit fir a 5 star 400 euro a night a hotel. The only advantage is the location close to the Medina and the spa whose staff was friendly. 

We were utterly disappointed with the attitude of the management and their incompetence at simple things like check out. The Accord group needs to give its general manager at this hotel a lesson on being amire considerate to its customers. I actually just chose another hotel other than the sofitel for a business meeting for a large group. 
I do not recommend the Sofitel Marrakech. You can choose many others with much better service. 
Mr.  benKirane you just lost a client for the sofitel!!!!!!"
"I stayed at this hotel for several days early this month.  My first complaint is that it is full of perfume everywhere, and I spent all my time indoors there coughing and sneezing.  My second complaint is that it took them all afternoon to find rooms for our group, which had been prebooked by the tour company.

My room was spacious and nicely furnished, but poorly lit.  And the service, esp. the lobby crew, was not what it should have been.

I found this hotel very pretentious, and hope it is not representative of all Sofitels.  This was my first one.)"
"Stayed here last week for 4 nights and despite complaining about the poor wi-fi connection nothing was done by the staff to sort it. To top it they charged me 52 euros approx for laundry of two jeans that too on normal delivery. Total rip off. Beware!"
"We stayed for a single night at the hotel as our flights were changed. Lovely hotel but exceptionally poor service. There were so many staff everywhere but all service (check-in, food, drinks) was so, so slow. We ordered drinks at the bar and despite 8 members of staff on either side of the bar, our order took 20 mins to arrive after 2 chases. Check in was 5 1/2 hours and a complete shambles. Would not recommend to anyone looking for a relaxing stay."
"Oh dear, where to start. 

I'll be specific with multiple examples of poor service unexpected for a Sofitel that really ruined our stay. The smaller boutique riads offer better value/service. Given the multiple issues experienced by myself and friends - am surprised at this score.

1) Upon arrival despite booking and checking-in (!!) the newer lounge and spa we were moved through the building into the older Imperial WITHOUT our consent. The hotels adjoin each other so we didn't realise we had been moved until next day our friends described their rooms. Having unpacked and settled we chose not to move but were unhappy.

2) Despite confirming bookings for spa they did not have our appts - only after complaining did they then accommodate our original timings.

3) Despite email explicitly asking for a ladies hair appt (wash/dry/pin-up) for my partner (we had a wedding to attend) the hairdresser didn't know how to pin-up hair!! They found another hairdresser who then proceeded to do a poor job (pins fell out on way back to room). Despite listing a hairdresser on the website the hotel is clearly unable to offer a quality full service. 

4) When requesting shirt pressing was told someone is coming, 20m later.. called again.. they said coming, nothing. 15m later I left the room. When eventually next day shirt was picked up was meant to be ready by 2pm shirt only returned when chased at 4pm... seriously? Am i meant to be chasing staff.

5) Breakfast very overpriced. Go to the cafe literally across the road - great food, on third of the price.

There is a general 'lack-of-responsibility' culture and poor communication with the staff. Upon problems occurring no one takes responsibility or tries to fix. 

Only when pressured or complaining, or with escalation do things get fixed.
Poor communication is also to blame.. if there is a delay/problem - then why?  

Its a large hotel and maybe it was a busy period but we had around 10 rooms and others also had problems ranging from pungent and/or unmade rooms being offered to malfunctioning AC with consensus around generally lack of responsiveness 

I complained extensively and so got some resolution, needless to say having to complain about basic simple things ruined our stay.. Those without the inclination or demeanor to complain as I did would probably suffer here in silence."
"On our 10 year anniversary and booked the Sofitel because it came across as quite plush and the place to have a bit of an indulgent week. The surroundings are admittedly luxurious but it ends there. We were put in a junior suite, but the bathroom was badly designed - anytime the shower was used there ended up being a great deal of water on the floor and we had to use half of our towels to keep it from going into the main room. The separate toilet was a bit dated and small. We were ok with these anomalies but not with the staff service, which was actually quite appalling. A couple of times my wife asked questions at reception about facilities, how to get to a restaurant etc. The staff were dismissive of her, to the point to rudeness. In fact one of the night clerks went so far as not even to say anything but just gestured for her to speak to the concierge, turned his back on her and pointedly played with his mobile. What made it even worse was that a few seconds a European couple walked up and he was all light and sweetness. It is quite apparent that he thought that since she was Asian and a female, he did not need to show the respect she deserved as a guest. This happened to a lesser extent several times - when she ordered tea on the terrace and it took ages to come, and when it did it was done grudgingly; when we were waiting in line to speak to the concierge and a random Middle Eastern guest jumped in front and he started to engage with her despite seeing us in line until I seriously lost it and told both of them this was unacceptable and that she needed to wait her turn. I am logging a complaint with the general manager over these issues but it is quite clear that the staff have a superiority complex as well as giving a strong impression of racially-segmented behaviours. This is unacceptable. I have stayed in many great hotels across the world, this is the one where I have felt the most uncomfortable and I would not choose to stay here again any time soon."
"Concierge : not to trust. Wrong info about tours. Lack of explanations. Mostly not present at the desk cause busy chatting elsewhere.

Check in and out : 
Not very helpful . Language barrier? 
Demanding to wait till their computer system was up and running again even though our transportation was waiting outside.
"
"Ok, where do I begin from...
1. Check - in took 20 mins, oh and guess what, we were the only ones in queue. They kept telling us, please relax and take a seat and we wanted to take our room and feed my 9 montn old.

2. House Keeping Service: We pre requested for a microwave (which until my checkout didnt arrive) and an electric kettle, which after calling the reception 3 times and then shouting at them to deliver asap as I didnt have warm water to feed my son, it finally arrived 2hrs after our request. Oh and the cherry on top was when I opened the kettle, it was filled with burned calcium and some weird oil. I called millions of times but now they just didnt pick up. I had to personally go down, literally shout at the team leader threatening him that I wouldnt pay him unless I have a kettle. He finally moved his butt and got me a proper clean one. Worse part was, my son had diarrhea and I need to give him warm water ors frequently. I was warming the bottle in the hotel toilet by running it under warm water to feed him!!! Worst experience of my life!

3. Main Reception: First, staff is extremely not welcoming. If you ask them something they look at each other and the query goes from one to the next. It was endless. Better figure it out yourself.

I gave 2 points simply to room service who delivered our food warm and in lesser time than they promised. And to Yousuf the waiter who works in the restaurant that serves mainly breakfast and lunch. He was very warm, welcoming and great at his work. Thank you Yousuf!

All of this, team leader apologised and waived the breakfast charge for one person MAD 250DH. Honestly I would pay 10 times this amount to never go through the stress that I went through and above all what my little son went through!"
"We booked this holiday not knowing that it would be during Ramadan, so most resturants and all bars were closed. The hotel staff were extremely tired and level of service was low.

The hotel was also under construction and this should have been mentioned in the booking advertisement. 

The hotel is extremely over priced e.g £8 for a conflict coke.....I'm not sure even the Ritz charge such ridiculous prices. The hotel food was absolutely horrific and again ridiculously expensive for what is was worth.

If your looking for staff who can speak English then your better off going to the local Square Souq as the market traders actually speak English. 

If you don't speak French or Arabic expect bad service."
"I love the Sofitel brand and frequently stay at Sofitel across the world. We stayed at this hotel 2 years ago and gave the benefit of the doubt for the initial bad service because we liked the hotel and visited again.  This is not a CHEAP hotel it is expensive to stay eat and drink. Returned in September for 15 nights after staying at a Sofitel airport hotel (subject to an excellent separate review).

Pros
Has a beautiful majestic setting
In a good location near the medina, shops and high quality restaurants
Spectacular gardens, reception area and terrace
Great pool area

Cons
Booked hotel transfer at 250 mad they weren't there when we arrived
Booked a non smoking room given one with an adjoining door where the smoke seeped under the door
Check in took 45 minutes to be told room wouldn't be ready until 3pm and they would call me when ready
Didn't receive a call and returned at 4pm room wasn't ready told to return in 30 minutes as the hotel was full
Ordered refreshments at the pool waiters ignored the request on several days
For 6 days of the holiday housekeeping had to be contacted daily for towels which hadn't been replaced
Rooms often not tidied until after 5pm
Couldn't use the balcony because of bird poo on the day bed which was only cleaned on the last few days
Carpet was never hovered
Bathroom floor never cleaned
Sink was cracked
Carpets throughout the accommodation areas were worn
Accommodation area was tardy, dirty and weary
No Tea or coffee facilities in the rooms
Sockets hanging out the wall 
Bulbs removed from the lift one out of six in place
Lift alarm activated no one responded to confirm if this was an emergency
Person injured at the pool and asked for a first aid kit no one appeared
Building work on-going putting pools in and ripping a new one out
Too many people in suits looking important but not being responsible or accountable for anything
When complaints were made to a manager they didn't resolve anything 
Waited 20 minutes at check out to allow 5 staff to finish bickering  in front of two customers

To summarise lacks customer focus and service, lacks management structure, responsibility and accountability, obvious deterioration with minimum maintenance in the accommodation areas. If thinking about visiting look at other better hotels in the vicinity. We will not be returning to this hotel."
"We arrived at midnight and checkin took 1 hour, we were quite upset and very exhausted. We ordered room serviced and ice cream was frozen...a good way to ruin Haagen Dazs ice cream!
Breakfast was good and also housekeeping service was good. Very big property  to reach my room I had to walk at least 8 minutes. Reception really needs improvement!!!"
"We stayed just one night at the Sofitel in Marrakesh. It was awful. Checking in took forever - they sat us down in the lobby and left us there for 20 minutes before we managed to attract a member of staff's attention, they then very inefficiently took our details and passports etc, the girl did not seem to know what she was doing. She then forgot to give us back our credit card and had to search around to find it. The room was difficult to find as the hotel was quite sprawling. The room was supposed to be non-smoking - it definitely smelled of cigarette smoke. The room was very uninspiring, we expected more for £200 per night. Check out was a disaster - we attempted to check out and the reception desk said they were busy (there was no one else around!). we asked to see the manager and the said ""we do not have one"". We went to find the manager ourselves and he checked us out. He was very apologetic and offered us another night there - however it was too late, the damage had been done!"
"When in my way to the Marrakech airport after a medium week in Sofitel, I was reached by a hotel car, asking back my receipt (payed in cash) because a bill of about 10 Euro was missing, asking me to go back to the hotel. I paid the 10 Euro in order to avoid to miss my plane directly to hotel staff. They took my receipt, promising to mail it to me with the correction. After a month, I was charger the full amount of the stay (around 1,000 Euro) on my credit card. I had left a slip from my card at arrival time. The hotel, contacted by me, refused to answer. So, if you want to stay in this average level but expensive hotel, be very wise: your stay could cost you twice as supposed !!!"
"A lovely hotel in an excellent location, within walking distance of the old town and the bustling market square and souks. The spa is also fab with a lovely quiet pool area, the best pedicure I've had for a while. Tried all of the restaurants and all served great food, particularly the traditional Moroccan restaurant where both the food and service were excellent. What let this hotel down was the extremely poor service at breakfast and around the pool. I think that quite a few of the reviews for this hotel are fake - staff have no interest in serving you at breakfast, you have to ask repeatedly for tea/coffee and cutlery/crockery, the only thing that is done efficiently is the clearing of tables. A lot of the waiting staff in the pool area stand around talking to each other (except when a manager appears) and ignore you or walk away when you call them to order food, etc. My husband went and asked one of them for a menu one day and they directed him to the outdoor restaurant area. My teenage children went to the pool on their own one day and asked repeatedly for towels and were ignored, eventually a man on the next door lounger intervened and towels were provided. Twice we arrived back from a day sight seeing (around 15:00) and were told that there were no towels left! All in all fab food, fab location, but EXTREMELY poor service around the pool and at breakfast. I should mention that there was one afternoon when the service was what you would expect - as a group of men in suits moved around the pool area, obviously inspecting and discussing the hotel. A great shame that they weren't there for the entire week!"
"I have always loved a Sofitel and will usually always opt to stay in one if given the choice, however this one lets the brand name down a little: 

The good : The hotel is stunning. It is a gorgeous mix of moroccan culture and modern decor. It is also huge, with massive lobbies and walkways meaning you never feel cramped or on top of other holiday makers ( although be warned the pool area gets very busy and we found it near impossible most days to find a sunbathing spot.) 
    It is also ideally located. You are no more than a 15 minute walk away from all the local amenities, such as the Medina, cafes, shops and restaurants. ( do not feel guilty about ordering a cab though, in the Moroccan heat  15 mins can feel like hours) so in terms of aesthetics and location, top marks. 

The bad: On more than one occasion we were left waiting well over an hour for menus to arrive at our table when trying to order a poolside snack, hollering down staff seemed near impossible and many holidaymakers were actually leaving the complex to get refreshments elsewhere as they were tired of waiting. When we were finally served our menus,food coming out was again very slow and the wait for the bill and change was painstaking. We found this to be the case when relaxing in the bar in the evening also. Getting served is like finding a lake of water deep in the Moroccan desert - a real rarity, nearing on impossible! 
       Although our rooms were cleaned and tidied daily, quiet often they would forget to replenish towels meaning we had to head down to reception and request clean towels be sent to the room. An hour later no towels. 2 hours later, no towels. The towels never appeared. Our complimentary dressing gowns also went walk about after day 1! I know this isn't the end of the world but there is no better feeling than getting out of a nice, warm shower after a hot day and into a white fluffy robe. We had this privilege once. We hAd the privilege of clean towels being left without nagging twice! Poor. 

The ugly: They advertise high speed wifi. The only thing high speed about the wifi was my temper trying to access anything online! It was slower than slow and rarely worked. Incredibly frustrating to say the least. I know when abroad internet access shouldn't be all that important but lets be honest, it is 2014 and we all want to access our emails and check social media when on holiday. If you have any plans to do so at this hotel, change them! 

In summary, the hotel itself if large, spacious, beautifully decorated and ideally located, and don't get me wrong the staff are very friendly and polite but the service is diabolical. Looking at other reviews many people have had the same experiences as me and nothing appears to have changed. How can this hotel warrant 5*s?!? "
"I stayed at this hotel for my mum’s 60th birthday and a friend’s wedding (luckily the wedding was not at this hotel).

Prior to arrival, I was liasing with the hotel to confirm my reservation and room bookings.  I had to book 2 rooms as they could not accommodate 3 people in one room. Despite numerous calls from London, where the call would be disconnected, put on answermachine for more than 40minutes or being passed from one person to the next, I managed to confirm my booking and in particular an early checkin (due to our flight arrival), luxury room with pool view and balcony (which was upgraded as there was availability and due to the inconvenience with the calls) and non-smoking room (I had numerous discussions with Hanene from Guest Reservations, who actually didn’t action anything what was agreed, so wasted my time and incurred my telephone costs).

Upon arrival, I was told both rooms were not available.  I was told I would be contacted within an hour, having given them more than 2 hours I went to the checkin desk and told to wait.  The reason the room was not ready was the mini-bar – I don’t think it takes 3 hours to check the mini-bar, even at the slow pace they work.  Normal checkin time is 3pm – it was agreed prior to my arrival to have both rooms that I booked ready for 12pm (with Hanene who disappointinly failed us).  I did not get my room until 4pm – to my shock was given a disabled room with an awful, shocking smoking smell.  One of my family members is an asthamatic and cannot stay in a smoking room.  Also, there was no balcony as I was offered a ground floor room (not as per my room booking).  I dealt with a staff member called Fatima who was rude and unhelpful.  Having expressed my concerns and after another hour (5pm), I was then offered a ‘decent’ room for the 1st night, and then moved on the 2nd night to a room which was originally agreed (Marouane – Front Office Supervisor managed to sort out after all the inconveniece I was caused) – not a great start to our holiday!

The shocking bits:
Firstly, although the pool is nice what we saw was horrific.  When guests leave the pool their towels remained on the sun loungers/beds.  The towels are left to dry for a period of time with the pool attendees coming to check if dry, if not they are kept out.  The pool attendees then come to check if dry (by patting each towel), then folded for the next guest as they remained on the sun lounger/bed.  Not only disgusting and unhygienic but not what is expected from a Sofitel chain.  I even had to tell some of the guests to ask for clean towels as this is what they had done and were about to use the ‘used’ towels.  When questioned a pool attendee, the response I got was ‘this is what we are told to do!’  My advise if you do stay at this hotel – bring your towel from the room!

At breakfast, as lovely as the display of foods.  One day, they served melon and pineapple that was gone off and I got severely ill.  When I told the chef, they tried it, admitted it had a ‘funny taste and must be bad’ and removed it from the breakfast.  This resulted in 3 days of me having diarrhoea and severe vomiting.
The staff would handle the pastries with their hands despite servering cutlery being available – no wander I found facial hair (eyelash) in both crossiants and pastries – basic hygiene requirements need attention.  Breakfast is simple fruit and pastries – no cooked breakfast.

I was on a half board basis – warning: you need 3-4hours for dinner. It takes 30minutes to just bring a menu, another 45minutes to bring drinks.  The pace at which they work is alarming, and they have no sense of time when serving – whether they want the restaurants to look busy or genuinly are sluggish I do not know.  You might as well eat out, as the food standard is not of a typical Sofitel expectation.

Housekeeping – be prepared to ask for toiletries and towels as they often ‘forgot’ to replace when towels were clearly on the bathroom floor for replacing and the toilet roll had finished!  A lot of chasing, and had to look for them as they didn’t come within an hour to replace.

Check your bill on checkout – despite half board basis, I was charged for meals.  I requested the staff to check the bill and correct.  I was told to come back in 2 hours.  Again after painful 2 hours, nothing had been done by the reception desk staff at Lounge and Spa.  At this time, the reception desk was closed and I had to go to the other Sofitel desk to sort out.  They charged me for minibar use and restarant bills which was inaccurate – corrected after checking restaurants bills that I supposed ate when I was on a day trip and when all minibar items were accounted for – becareful they don’t cheat you and take a copy of all signed bills.  The hassle to sort this out was painful and the checkout staff were extremely rude (Aberrahim) and again sluggish, they clearly have time but don’t realise you don’t!  At least the duty manager (Mohammed) tried to sort it out after 2 hours.

I was so surprised at the standard of this hotel – definitely not a typical 5 star hotel.  It is cosmetically nice, but when it comes to service and hygiene it wouldn’t even meet a 3 star.  It was such a disappointing holiday and a hotel from hell– I would never go back or recommend anyone to stay here – you are better staying at the Hivernage Spa and Hotel which is round the corner!"
"I came here twice to use the pool as my Riad has no pool.

We had drinks by the pool the first time and although the water was 45 dirham and a glass of wine was 90 dirham I didn't mind so much as they let us use their nice pool. Chips were 50 dirham and pizza was 150dirham. Way overpriced for Marrakech even.

2nd time was a disaster. We walked 3-4km in 40c heat and when we got there we were told it was 400 dirham each to use the pool. I repeat - 400 dirham each. That's 80€ for two people to use a pool. Disgraceful. Then we said we would be having lunch so why not let us in to use the pool. They then said 700 dirham for pool and lunch. Each. 

We said no then walked over to the Novotel who charged only 200 dirham."
"Having stayed elsewhere earlier in our stay, we booked Sofitel as a last night luxury end to our trip to Marrakech, based on the brand & reputation, plus the fabulous images on the website.

The check in process that then took over 3 hours, meant we completed wasted our last day in Marrakech (and at 45 degrees heat, very uncomfortable) and left completely disappointed & extremely upset - plus out of pocket. We ended up booking somewhere else locally and leaving as soon as we could.

On arrival, the porters were impolite, no greetings, and suitcase disappeared and a bag tag just shoved to us, with no explanation.

Check in, after being handled by 3 or 4 different people took close to 3 hours - first told the room would be ready in 20 minutes, then offered another room in the Palace side of the hotel (which we declined as was not what we wanted or had booked - the receptionist even agreed it was not nice); we left the hotel for lunch and still no room. No apology or service when we finally got a key.

The room unfortunately looked nothing like the website - rips in furniture, a broken glass, smell of paint and overlooking a maintainance site. We were kindly moved - but back to the same palace side we had declined hours before. Maintainance work in the hotel & corridors made it feel very unluxurious - understandably work has to be done at some point, but there was no reference to this on the website or at the time of booking.

We were also told by a member of staff that they were only just over half full anyway, and with the size of the hotel, I am sure this service issues could have all been avoided. 

I would never recommend this hotel - it looks tired, and the service was no where near 5 star. On a positive note the receptionists, despite looking on the whole quite embarrassed did want to help as much as they could."
"upon arrival our driver had to carry the luggage out of the car up the stairs to the hotel and then the porter came to carry next to the reception. Now the procedure for check in was starting. 2 desks and 4 ladies were working behind. I was the only (!!!) guest waiting for the check in. Nobody was caring about me. After 5 minutes of waiting time I have asked one lady if she is able to care about us and our check in. Then she asked for passports and for the credit card. The room was already paid in advance. We should sit down in the lounge. 5 minutes later a lady came and wanted us to fill in the form for staying in the hotel. Before I wanted to do it I have asked to get back our passports before because I did know that her colleague has already made a print of it. Then we got back the passport but not the credit card! She has forgotten to print and to charge it (!!!) because you need to pay an additional deposit of 1000 Dirham per day (about 100 € !!!). So she returned to make this print and charge! Then it took another 5 minutes to get the keycard for our room. In the meantime we have got some tea and of course the qualified lady knocked down the tea which was poured over the form...
Then we walked with our keycards for the room trough almost dark floors in the ground floor to the lift and have entered the wrong lift. Of course the porter who was walking behind us and not ahead of us told us that we are in the wrong lift (elevator). So after a while we could enter the room and were very surprised that there was not a luxury furniture or decoration or interiour design. Even the materials are cheap! A little bit of luxury impression you can see at the lobby ground floor. There was no information about the hotel facilities or phone number in the room. The breakfast was poor and the staff prefered to play with children of the guest or to talk with colleagues. So we needed to wait 10 minutes before a waiter has seen us and felt able to ask for our wishes. The choice of marmelade, jam, or cold cuts was poor.When one man behind a breakfast bar has cut a slice of salmon he took it with his naked hand wearing no gloves to put it on my plate. This is the best example for perfect hygiene and you will have a good chance to become ill! In the bar at evening or night it was empty. The drinks are very expensive and of course you will get only little bit of alcohol. Although in the bar there were no other guest we needed to wait a long time for our bill. The reason was simple. The waitress has forgotte us. She has prefered to talk with a colleague at the bar..As a result I cannot recommend this hotel. The value for money is poor!"
"I have never felt the need to review a hotel before -as long as the good points out-way the bad points  then I figure 'lets move on'
On arrival we had to wait 4 hours for our room -we were told they had a large group arriving and they had to take priority.
Allocated a 'quiet' room overlooking a noisy construction site within the hotel -next day I invited the manager to visit our room to share our experience -he was unavailable so we had a visit by the room allocations manager.(see photo) When asked why rooms overlooking a construction site were not closed down to paying customers and the time used to clean the carpets and curtains and repair the broken items in the bathroom he replied (with some embarrassment) that it was not Sofitel policy to close rooms during construction.
He re-allocated us another 'quiet 'room overlooking a main road into the city!!(see photo)
Pool area was very nice and staff very pleasant and helpful -again pool furniture was very badly stained and dirty.
Breakfast was adequate and service OK as long as there was not a large delegation in the hotel --then service was  poor.
Overall the week we spent there was not a good experience and the manager could not be bothered to find us to offer an explanation or apology.
This hotel charges for 5*goods and services and offers some customers 3* experience 
Beware ---you have been warned!"
"Beautiful and big hotel, many rooms but few staff to attend the hosts....when I needed somenting, I had to say 3 or 4 times in order to have my request satisfied... The impression I had they simple did not pay attention what I was requesting....frustrated !!! 
      "
"The property itself is relatively nice, especially the pool area. 
Elevators in the hotel are slow. We stayed in a junior suite facing the main entrance and it was spacious but a little worn out. Unfortunately the service at the hotel is horrible! You order a mojito and you get a pina colada. You order a burger and 40 mins later when you ask for it you are told that they forgot about it. Room service was ok but the food was cold when it arrived (burger, pizza and caesar salad). 

Being a platinum member with Accor, we didn't get any benefits. No upgrade, no newspaper delivered to the room, no gift, no late check-out before the very last moment..Also, Marrakech is pretty warm and all we got in our room was two small bottles of water per day. 

I hope to find an alternative hotel in Marrakech for my future stays. There's a Suite Novotel accross the street. Maybe it's better value for money?"
"We paid for a day's ""pool pass"" and ate lunch here. My partner had regularly stayed at the hotel before (on four previous occasions) and wanted to spend a day by the pool as our Riad did not have one. The hotel was undergoing some construction work close to the pool but this did not interfere with our experience. We were well attended to by the pool for drinks but our experience at the pool side restaurant for lunch was not good and spoilt the visit slightly. We were offered a table by the pool. Although the restaurant was well staffed and not particularly busy the table was not cleared of the dirty plates and cutlery for 10 minutes as our waiter was busy arguing with the manager (which continued sporadically during our visit). Having spoken to the manager we were sent over another waitress who cleared the table and took our order. This was not the end of our problems unfortunately. I was delivered the wrong dish, this was taken away and I was left with my side orders of french fries and vegetables. A replacement did not appear for over 20 minutes and only on request. By which time my side orders were cold. The mayo requested to go with the chips never appeared. When we had finished and paid we were then chased for a missing bit of paper at the pool an hour later. We did not have this as everything was left at the table. The food was average by the standards of all the restaurants we ate at during our stay in Marrakech but expensive. 

We were offered no apology for all the failings in service and I am therefore unable to recommend this restaurant to anyone. Sad because we enjoyed our day as a whole and paid for the privilege of spending the day by the hotel pool."
"I've been staying for 1 week, with a friend.
+ 
The hotel looks nice from the outside; really nice pool area with a wide pool surrounded by comfortable beds, pillows. palm trees and Bougainville complete the picture. The garden area has hamakas, and dehors. The breakfast is really good and you'll find lots of different food ( both european and from morokko). 

- the customers service level is not a 5*; there're no towels enough for the customers at the pool, if you're looking for an umbrella you must be very lucky, they're not organized on bringing you what you ordered, and it takes 30 mins to get a bottle of water.  

Overall they're even having some renovations, glad i did not have the room close to that location. 

In the end the pool area is open to locals, and often the hotel customer comes after the local people. 

In the end i would say, you could spend better your money."
"This hotel is not five stars and is not luxury as they describe in their own name!

I could not believe the expensive prices for the quality of food, beverages,service, and rude staff!

Besides breakfast buffet, food takes very long to prepare and it is not up to par! (It taste like dog food).I had to go to other hotels to enjoy a good meal.

Asking staff for anything in this hotel in English - they will totally dismiss you.
I felt such a huge sense of prejudice for not speaking the language or French. I compare this to going to other hotels during my stay in Marrakech. 
I wish I would have spent an extra 100 or 200 to stay at Four Seasons, La Mamounia, or Pearl.

The service at the pool by a server Yosef was the worst service I ever experienced in my life.
There were no towels to lay on the day beds or dry off from the freezing cold pool. It also took 2 hours and yelling at a manager to get any service at the pool. 
At the hotel bar in the evening they frequently snubbed our table too!
The level of unprofessionalism is shocking! I am still in awe.
The hotel was not even close to capacity for that to even an excuse.

The hotel has a vintage feel with dirty carpets, clogged sinks, and sewage smells.

During our stay we got weird knocks on the door in the middle of the night and felt very unsafe. Calling security for this matter and calling front desk for anything I found our calls getting transferred to multiple people, disconnected, and long hold times which was really frustrating!!
The staffs favorite word in this hotel is Sorry because they kept making errors.
The key players at this hotel is Zacaris and Abderrahmane.
These two tried to help out and stood out for trying but the experiences at this hotel were so negative I would never return here even if they paid me themselves!

Overall my stay was a nightmare. I wish I could have enjoyed my stay because the area and city is beautiful. It was stressful and a burden to stay at this hotel. I would not recommend it to my worst enemy.
I have stayed at many Sofitel hotels (in USA) so I am shocked. I recommend the Sofitel in Agadir. It has amazing service, decorated nicer, and way less prices!

"We stayed at the hotel for ten nights. Whilst the surroundings are nice the attitude of the staff is somewhat different. If you do not tip them at every possible moment then they do not like it. I asked for my golf clubs to be stored in the luggage room and was astounded to find they had been left out all night. Despite assurances that the cameras had them covered this is not what you expect from a five star hotel. Breakfast on some occasions was a lottery not enough tables on some mornings and being shown to used tables was not what one would expect. Overall the hotel was nice but had our clubs been stolen then what would they have done then!!!!"
"To drive up to the hotel then it stands out, amazing, lobby and reception continues the wonderful impression. 
2 adults and a 6 year old, our room booked was a luxury suite yet they had not sorted my sons bed, we were given a ground floor room in a corner, near the maintenance entrance, the patio doors did not lock so we asked to change rooms. They accommodated the request, to a room smaller and off a lower class as no coffee facilities and air conditioning that only blows hot air, in 35' heat clearly a problem but one they could not sort apart from turning it off, I guess ok if the sun was not directly facing the room all afternoon. There are clearly plenty of staff who want to do a good job but it is not to a luxury standard. The food was average but very expensive, eat elsewhere if you can, we had to send food back twice on different occasions as not hot!!
The swimming pools and service around the pool was excellent. 
We still have 4 days left so hoping for improvements."
"when I get to a Hotel I look at the customer service is very importune for me than anything else.
From the first call to  the hotel to make my booking I spoke to this girl called HANANE BOUGUETTA. she give me the best rate. she was the warmest person that you could speak too, she is excellent at her job.
when I got to the reception the responsible remembered me. she up grade me. that is very good feeling, and when they remember you and the call you buy your name that's very good .
I used the SPA AICHA was the best again, is has fantastic team.
At SOFITEL they have one of the best NIGHT CLUB in Marrakech but I can not recommend it, is only place I never enjoyed. I've been few time but never change. bad service and poor management. they don't recognise the regular client of the Hotel which is bad for the brand."
"we arrived at 2:30pm and were asked to wait until 3pm. Fair enough, we went to the pool side restaurant, service was horribly slow. We got our room at 3:30, it was not worth the wait, small and overlooking the highway. Lots of cars buzzing by late or rather early into the morning.
The complimentary internet was bad, breaking up and loosing connection all the time. I could only get wifi connection in the toilet!
We ordered room service for 6:30am, it came close to 7am.
Guess what, I am definitely not going to stay there again!"
"I stayed at this hotel just 2 nights. The hotelroom was absolutely no value for money ( room 60). The room is equipped for invalids, but I would not even recommend it for them. The curtain was partially torn, the fridge did not work, the toilet reservoir was leaking, so it refills every 10 minutes. Every morning there was a bad smell in the bathroom. The door to the terras could not be locked ( was fixed). The connecting door made it unfortunately possible to overhear the voices in the other room. Within these 2 days, 3 times a employee of the hotel entered my room without any knocking, even with the do not disturb sign outside the door. I had the feeling that this room was used by the staff, not expecting that a guest was using it. The staff at the reception was not very friendly and not very open to my complaints. Not a nice experience and will certainly choose another hotel next time, despite the Spa, that was a wonderful experience"
"I would NOT recommend this hotel at all. I generally do alot of research before booking hotels as I am very particular; though this hotel received mixed reviews I liked the fact that this was a well known brand (therefore certain level of expectation would be adhered to), seemed close the souks, restaurants etc...

The hotel is there to rip people off, down to the hotel porters, restaurant staff and concierge etc.. 

Our ""suite"" was located on the ground floor and had an awful stink to it (I am guessing it was located near pipes and the kitchen (possbily). Upon checking in straightaway we had issues, our air conditioning wasn't working and had to call twice to get this fixed (wasting 1.5hrs!), our windows which led to the garden area and the balcony door were left open  - they could not be locked. After calling maintenance they fixed this. However every day housekeeping would leave our balcony door (ground floor) open - bearing in mind that people could walk past our room and just enter in was appalling. 

Out front door would not lock and even the device that locks it from the inside (door guard) did not work, on three occasions the hotel staff (cleaners, maintenance, you name it!) just walked in whilst we were in the room with the DO NOT DISTURB sign on. 

This is the most unprofessional hotel I have ever had the misfortune to stay at. In addition to this (and please be careful) the ""Concierge"" was a complete joke, they would only recommend what would seem like places where they probably get a cut (money!) from. When I tried to ask them about other places that came recommended they would not enterain talking about them; they had their own agenda which made us feel very uncomfortable. They recommended the worst places to eat; in addition when we booked a hammam from a place that they recommended we had to cancel on the day (giving 2 hours notice) he went ballistic (very unprofessional) stating that I should have told him yesterday, I had to explain that I cannot predict when I get ill and therefore had to cancel. I had to raise my voice and be very rude back for him to back down. 

There is one particular hotel porter (I didn't get his name!) that insisted on carrying everything we had even though we would keep saying no just to get a tip. Even on our last day we walked out of the hotel and he insisted on stopping my husband to find out his room number so he could check if we checked out - UMM are you not a Hotel porter? Who the hell are you to check if we have checked out. That is our responsibility and the hotel take your card details if people just leave a hotel without checking out. ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS. 

Breakfast is just full of pastries and unhealthy items (apart from yoghurt and some pasty looking fruit!). I would recommend going to the cafe (called ExtraBlatt) that is on the road in front of the hotel (past Novotel). Breakfast cost if overpriced too. 

The taxis outside of the hotel are way overpriced - just walk down the road and grab a cab from there (you will cut the price by half!). 

Do not get a hotel taxi from the airport; they charge 25 Euros when you can get a cab for 50 Dinars. 

TO SUMMARISE - Stay at Novotel, Stay in a Riad - I wouldn't bother wasting ANY money at this hotel. The only saving grace is ""So Lounge"" which has a lovely ambience and had a great band entertaining guests (Seven Senses!) 

I thought Softel was 5* luxury - I would rather stay at Travellodge! I would never stay at Sofitel again."
"Marrakech is a wonderful place and Sofitel are generally not bad, however, after the initial impressions of the interesting interior in the public areas of this hotel had worn off, we began to feel a great sense of disappointment and then finally anger!

I'm not sure if it was the two-hour wait for the room to be ready (at 16:00!) on arrival or the fact that we were then charged for our ""welcome"" drinks in the bar or maybe it was the smell of sewage when we finally entered the room and the grubby carpets, ramshackle chest of drawers or the fact that the doors to the minibar would not close and hung permanently at “half cock”.

Was it the fact that the air conditioning would neither cool nor heat?  In February you need both.

Could it have been the pigeons living on the balcony that had clearly taken up residence a long time ago? I really should have photographed them nesting in between the cushions on the balcony sofa.  Their “doings” were all over: on the table and chairs, on the sofa and cushions, on the balcony rail, floor, need I go on?  Our first three days involved early start excursions so we only had a chance to complain about this on the fourth day.  The mess was, sort of, cleaned but as I predicted, said pigeons came straight back and continued where they had left off.  This rendered the balcony unusable.

As others have also commented here, the shower was a trickle, variously hot and then cold with no way of regulating the temperature because of the low flow rate.  Tip to other guests, I managed to fix this.  Simply unscrew the shower attachment then turn on the shower.  This will expel the rubber “filter” which, in our case, was blocked by some more rubber.  Screw the showerhead back and, hey presto! you have a perfectly working shower.

Was it the ritual humiliation of waiting at the front of the breakfast queue whilst ""well kent"" locals were taken from behind and seated first?  This happened on the two mornings when we were able to have a late breakfast (10:00 am-ish).  At 07:30 it was just about possible to get a table with no waiting; at 08:00 it is already too late.  On one occasion, even when assigned a table and told to “go to the buffet whilst we clean it”, we came back to find one such local had plonked her handbag there and claimed it had been there all along.  It had not and the waiter told us so, however, paying guests seem to come last when it comes to service here.

Maybe we were disappointed by the waiting and waiting and waiting for service in any of the bars or the very limited menu in the restaurant or the lack of eating choices anywhere?

Perhaps it was the fact that, having called for “help with the bags”, on release day, nobody came so we hauled them down ourselves?

So, overall impressions?  Well it’s a “no” from me I’m afraid.  Not so much *****; more like **!

By the way, some of the staff here are running a scheme in order to have a mention on this site, handing out slips of paper with their names and the Trip Advisor URL.  I did wonder why so many reviews seem to mention staff by name."
"The building is huge and there are a lot of rooms but not enough staff (and extra beds)!!! I asked for an extra bed 3 days before my stay because we took 2 rooms for 5 people, my daughter needed a bed, they tell me. That all the beds are booked and that there are no more for my family: what? I mean how can there not be at least one extra bed per room? This is crazy. Then we get to our connecting rooms and there is a piece of plastic in the door and we can't open it so I call the lobby to ask for maintenance to send somebody up, nobody comes, I call 3 times and the third time the guy says to me ; "" all you have to do is open the door"", the door was locked with no other to open it then to call main tench to fix it, finally maintenance comes and fixes it. Breakfast is good but nothing else is, the lobby is grey and depressing, the decoration is horrible, if you want a nice hotel go someplace else!!!!!"
"it was a great trip,we enjoy the city and the weather ...but we were lodged in a sofitel with no treatment for the mattress and it smell very bad.... so many client use the same bed and it must be  cleaned by a special company at least  once a year with certificate and sticker as i saw in turkey"
"Of all the Sofitel I visited this one was the worst. 
Besides the very friendly head of reception and the overwhelming breakfast, few of the features are pleasant. 

The worst experience was that the pool-guys put magazines on the chairs to reserve them and ""sell"" those during the day (which felt weirdly like some cheap low-class hotel in Mallorca). I spotted a few of them getting payed when they ""offered"" the chairs to guests who payed them. it's outrages that the guys make money by selling chairs at the pool. I would fire every single one of them.

The Spa is not included in the room, so you have to pay extra every time you want to use the sauna or steam bath (why do they call it spa hotel?)

It's true that everybody is very slow and ordering your check or checking in took at least 30 minutes.

"
"We booked this hotel with a view to enjoying a nice relaxing break, as the location and facilities looked great. Sadly though the hotel itself is well located and is lovely, the service really lets it down and ruins the experience and its a shame as all it would have taken is for the staff to communicate when required and be friendly. 

The lady that checked us in was cold and uninterested, I had emailed the hotel before to ask for a well located room as this trip was for my husbands birthday, and when I asked her she ignored the question twice. When we were taken up to the room I was sad to see the room had two single beds shoved together and a cot, we are a young couple with no kids and I had booked a kingsize bed, so this was clearly wrong. We went and spoke again to reception and they agreed to move us in a few hours when a room became available. 

We went out and came back to get changed for dinner, but found still (after 5 hours) no one had done anything. After another half hour of waiting, which would have been far more if we had not reminded them we had a dinner reservation and they were delaying us, we were finally moved to a ground floor room..they called it an upgrade but I would dispute that.   

The rooms are nice enough but a little worn and not what you would expect for a 5*. Small things like the shower head not staying in its holder, makes the stay frustrating. I also did not like the fact the room was on the ground floor and overlooked what I assume was the security/staff entrance..upgrade indeed. We decided not to ask for another room as we were too tired of all the hassle and were running late for our reservations. In hindsight I wish I had as there was a lot of noise very early in the morning, not what you want when you are on a relaxing break. There is also some building work ongoing which is probably what we heard.

The grounds are lovely, as are the bars. As others have mentioned the drinks are expensive, we had lunch by the pool one day which was nice enough. We spent a lot of time by the pool, it is hard to get a decent spot as everyone reserves their beds early in the morning but the staff near the pool do try and help. 

Check out - another bad experience, a man started dealing with us then without any explanation proceeded to pick up all the phone calls to reception and totally ignore us for 10 minutes.  His colleague then finished with his customer and started to serve us in what is the slowest check out ever.. and as he was doing so other customers waiting to check out were also understandably getting angry, as they were taking so long and the other man was still answering the phone instead of dealing with people. 

As we had a late flight we left our luggage and came back to use the courtesy room to change in, but even then there was a mix up. The lady gave me a card to enter the room to change then came back after a few minutes taking it back to say someone was already in there..I dread to think what would have happened if I had just made my way straight to the room when she had given me the key. We asked her to check how long it would be as we had a flight to catch and she didn't get back to us until we asked her again, and again. In the end we gave up waiting and just changed in the toilets.

The hotel itself is great, its the staff and service that totally let it down - simple things like communication and being helpful instead of uninterested, and being more efficient are severely lacking and ruin the experience. My advice would be to stay somewhere else."
"We booked a delux pool view room ( paid extra) in the Imperial Palace. The room allocated had a view of the main road. We were moved to the Lounge and Spa hotel. The rooms here are cheaper but we were not offered a refund. The room we eventually had was very tired and the décor shabby. The bathroom tiles were cracked and there was mould ( I took pictures). The sound system didn't work. We reported it but it was never fixed and no one even came to look at it ( it was just a missing connextion). Pity it used to be a great hotel- and the rooms are noisy as the staff do maintenance at night"
"Booked this as a surprise for my husbands 50th birthday. When we arrived we were told the room wasn't ready & they would phone us when it was. 3 hours later we returned to the desk to enquire where our room was. There was paper shuffling & the promised upgrade never materialised. Never mind. We queried about our half board & where we could eat & were told which restaurant we could eat in. On checking out, the extremely rude cashier told us they had no record of us having booked half board, despite me showing him proof from Thomas Cook. Completely humiliated in front of a queue of people! No tea or coffee making facility in the room. Mini bar never restocked although they managed to charge a fortune for stuff that was never in there in the first place. If you can speak French, you're fine, otherwise you will be completely ignored. Very disappointed. Should only be a 3 star hotel, if that."
"A confluence of a bad things -- booked a king bed, got 2 twins pushed together.  Bath drain did not work.  TV remote did not work, and all housekeeping did was manage to turn on the TV, but once I turned it off, it was off for good.  Street noise woke me up at 4:30 am, and I was on the 4th floor.  There were no wash clothes, no coffee maker.  Plus, at dinner, after a long wait, my salad and main course were served at the same time.  An overall extremely disappointing experience."
"A town and a hotel to avoid. When we got there we were downgraded in our choice of rooms , though we had paid for an  upgrade, it was only when my wife started to speak French that we got moved , there is a real feel of no interest in you if you are from the UK ? . Had a drink in the bar to recover got charged 30 pounds yes pounds for a kir royale . The rest of the trip is a blur of mistakes no pillows when you request them , a guide recommended by the hotel to provide a history of the Souk dumping us in a carpet shop where we struggled to get out without a contribution to the "" Moroccan economy "" , sub standard spar a rip off for the price and three days before we got offered any bread for breakfast or any poolside service. The town is a rip off taxi drivers almost hold you hostage until you give them what they want. In addition real danger in the Souk as runners descend on tourists and verbally abuse you for money. My advice go anywhere else but here."
"Do not understand English.  Sat in restaurant for almost 30 minutes and no one even recognized our presence.  Ordered room service and they totally screwed up order.  Finally got it 1/2 way straight after 3 try's.  Would not return here again.  Does not act like luxury hotel."
"We stayed at the Sofitel Marrakech for a long weekend in late September 2013, with a group of friends. The hotel is located about 10-15 minutes walk from the Jemma el Fna (main square) and the Souks. The Sofitel is very impressive from the outside set at the end of a wide boulevard, fronted by fountains, and with an impressive entrance façade. 

We arrived after a short flight from London and had arranged to be met by a car from the hotel – for which they charged a not inconsiderable 600 dirhams. The car was late, and it took several phone calls to the hotel before the car arrived. It is our belief that it hadn’t even left the hotel when we first called. This meant an extended wait of almost an hour in the arrivals hall. On arrival the check in procedure seemed to take forever too, with numerous forms to be filled in on top of the usual passport formalities. 

The communal areas of the hotel appear to have had a recent facelift, and both the main lobby and some of the secondary areas – including the Art Hall - are very successful. What was slightly disappointing is the general lack of colour used in the décor throughout the hotel. Marrakech is a city of vibrant sights, sounds, smells, and colour but the palate of colours used in the Sofitel is much more muted. We felt this a bit of a shame. Outside there are two large pool areas with huge day beds, and a plentiful supply of towels on hand. Some felt the water in the pools a little chilly – probably unheated – but generally the communal areas are pretty successful. 

The breakfast buffet was reasonably extensive and food generally well cooked. There was a little bit of a lack of choice of cooked items though, and for some reason the orange juice tasted slightly insipid. We did not eat in any of the restaurants so can’t comment on them. 

One of the major problems in the hotel is the quality of service - aside from Reception and The Concierge who were generally helpful and personable. Put simply the standard of service both at breakfast, and around the pool was woeful; just not up to standard for a 5* hotel. Everyone in our party had a similar experience. Waiters were inattentive. Food and drinks took ages to appear, and often had to be asked for twice. The vibe they gave off was one of “couldn’t care less”. 

The bedrooms are nicely decorated – albeit a little dull for Marrakech. Particular mention should go to the bed linen which was high quality cotton, with enormous duck or goose down pillows, and a wonderfully comfortable bed. The room was also fitted with black-out curtains so there was no sun pouring through the window at dawn! However, there were some issues in both of the bedrooms that we stayed in that smacked of a lack of management oversight, and/or staff training. These included: blown lightbulbs, loose bathroom fixtures, broken plug, cracked sink, leaking shower screen, (free) internet that was on then off then on, non-working telephone… I could go on. I have all these sorts of small issues at home, but then I’m not paying 5* hotel prices to stay at home.

In summary then, Sofitel Marrakech is a bit all talk, no walk. It has a great location and wonderful presence, but it is badly let down by a lack of attention to detail in the bedroom and bathroom, and a quality of service which is really not good enough. In a city like Marrakech which has such a wide variety of choice of hotels, riads and villas, it felt a real shame to have chosen Le Sofitel for our accommodation."
"I really do not like writing bad reviews, especially as many of the staff seemed to be ok people. But it really is difficult to express just how bad the service was during my stay. The hotel itself is beautiful with great pools. The room was good and well maintained. But all was overshadowed by the constant battle to get anything like part way reasonable service. You have to practically climb over the front desk to even get them to acknowledge your existence let alone do anything, we were asked to leave the restaurant and hurry up with our dinner (at 10.30) because they had to set up for breakfast, we learnt leave an extra 15 mins when asking for drinks and so on and so on. Service here makes the average Parisen hotel look friendly. Sorry to say this but things need a big, big  improvement."
"Stayed at this beautiful property but management sucks.
Got to the hotel on our honeymoon and everything went sour.
We were told that our room was still occupied and that the people are staying 2 more nights longer. They gave us a different room 6 hours later.
Talked to Mr Amine ( I guess the assistant Manager) and told us that he is sorry for any inconvenience  and he sent us 2 free Drinks ( didn't t get our point at all).
It s  a shame that in Morocco  there is no customer service at all."
"Hotel has a ""wow"" factor as a first impression....but after just a couple a hours you can notice sub standard service in ALL respects. After 2 days I am ready to leave and never come back. Nothing positive to say regarding this hotel, except maybe that they try hard. Comunicating with the reception will require patience, 20 tries over the phone which no one answers and finally a personal trip there! Otherwise forget it! Other examples of the poor service include no towels in the room after ""cleaning service"", no cups for tea or coffee in the room, no pillows for the extra bed (which took ages to be delivered to the room)....and so one. Bottom line, avoid this hotel!"
"By contrast to the Maison Arabe (see separate review) the Sofitel is everything I dislike in hotels. Stayed just one night in transit and that was enough. The large public areas are quite pleasant with well-chosen soft furnishings but like everything else it was superficial. Check-in took 30 minutes with a less than happy receptionist. The bags took a further 1 hour to arrive at the room. Calls to reception and and the porter's desk went unanswered (four calls in all).

The hotel was full of footballers (or that what's is said on their shirts - although not all of them could have been Rooney or Messi) and their WAGS. The price of food and drinks outrageous.

 On the plus side the room was functional, clean and the beds very comfortable; the buffet breakfast extensive, so I was going to be generous and award an average score if it wasn't for the snack meal we had by the pool. Chicken kebabs were undercooked. When pointed out they were taken away for 10 minutes and returned in the same state - but now with the accompanying chips cold!  A hotel that cares so little for potential health issues and disregard for customer service is one to avoid.

The tone for the Sofitel was set by the red Ferrari and yellow McClaren sports cars parked ostentatiously outside the main entrance. Bling but no substance.

In retrospect, hotels like this do actually serve a purpose - as long as their multiple rooms are fully occupied there's a chance that really good hotels have some space for me!"
"I have always wanted to stay at the Sofitel hotel in Marrakech, my brother came earlier in the year and recommended I come to visit the hotel as a possible venue for my wedding. I have been to morroco quite a few times and was looking for a quick get away.

On arrival we are given Moroccan tea which was lovely. The guy checked us in and said your room should not be ready until 3pm but we'll get it sorted for you in an hour. This wasn't the case and we ended up taking a king size bed rather then two singles. We got a smaller room & bathroom but decided to just deal with it. Room itself was very beautiful just small. The next day we went to the pool and decided we wanted to grab some lunch we went up to grab a table and noone approached us. There were 2 couples who got served before us. I decided to go and order myself. And new couple sat down & were brought drinks while we waited and waited by this point we got so fed up and left. The staff seem to sit around and do nothing. Not all staff are like this but majority. You have to ask to see a menu or ask for a drink. Really quite shocking I would never stay here again. It's quiet because of Ramadan so can't imagine what the service is like during peak season. Our shower also kept going hot and cold despite what temp you put it on. We complained 4 times and then would come mess around & then say it was fixed. It never was! Also none of the staff speak English so it's hard work all the time!
My advise would be look elsewhere you'll get better value for money & treated like royalty elsewhere! Drinks & food are really expensive too. I'm pretty well travelled & I wouldn't mind the money if it was worth it! "
"We stayed at this hotel, after a lovely 2 week vacation in 4 other hotels in Spain and Portugal from 1 July to 4 July. Almost from the onset we experienced terrible service. The check was the longest we have ever endured and completely inefficient. 

I had requested a rollaway bed which was not set up when I went out to dinner at 8pm. I reminded them. When I got back at 11pm it was still not set up. I called them again and was promised ""within 10 minutes"". A bed arrived at 12.30am!

Breakfast is terrible with the restaurant overcrowded, infested with large flies in an outdoor corner and poor food quality. Again, slow and bad service here. The omelette we ordered had a shell and strand of hair in it. 

Poolside service is also slow...no one approaches you and there are weird timings which means you don't get full food & beverage service throughout the day.

Usually lapses in services are tolerated by most guests however in this place, we just continued to get bad service throughout our stay.

The only exception is probably the concierge who we found helpful.

And it's not just us. Family who were with us:
1. Were picked up from the airport more than an hour late.
2. Not given two adjacent rooms as promised.
3. Overcharged 700 euro without explanation.

Everyone should stay away from the awful place!"
"Disliked this hotel so much! After a 2 weeks of travelling and staying in Accord Hotels ranging from 3 star to 5 star - this is by far the worst stay I've had! Service was horrible - definitely not typical to service at any Accord hotel- let alone a 5 star. Upon checking in our shower flooded not once but twice despite having called the front desk. Little communication from staff and waited nearly 2 hours to get any response and having to march to the front desk in bathrobe and soapy hair after midnight to demand a new room. Our replacement room was awful - overpriced, old and hardly a moroccan decor. For an upgraded suite...this was a huge disappointment. Room service food was disgusting...ordered steak and got steak with a processed cheese slice on top...seriously, at a 5 star??? Our food cart remained in the hot humid hallway for over 12 hours before someone came by to collect it. I had previously stayed at 4 Sofitel hotels that week and all were a lovely experience...this one is not worth it!! On a positive note - the pool area and concierge were great. The restaurants, although lacking menu variety - had a great vibe!"
"On our departure day, our wake-up call has been forgotten by reception. So we had not enough time to have a full breakfast. Only 20 minutes to shower and run to the airport. Asked for a cup of tea but the bar was not open yet (it was 8 am). The only solution offered was to pay for an entire buffet breakfast just to have a single tea. So we left the hotel thirsty and hungry.
The previous day, we had dinner at the Orangerie restaurant, inside the hotel. They forgot 50% of our order ! We tried to call the waiter several times (while the manager was seated with friends nearby !). Finally when the waiter came, we were told that kitchen had closed !!! Unbelivable ! So we could not have the dish we had ordered and no dessert ! 
That's the experience we had. No need to tell that we will never come back or recommend this hotel. People are kind. But kindness is not service. "
"This is a beautifully appointed hotel in a well situated part of Marrakesh. The pool area is stunning. However, the service is variable, some of the staff were helpful and friendly, others were very off-hand. We booked on the basis of breakfast and evening meal but on check-out we were presented with a bill that included our dinners. We pointed out this was incorrect but the clerk was reluctant to believe us. Fortunately, we had our booking confirmation and showed this. A correct revised bill was produced which we paid with a credit card. 
Some weeks later when our credit card statement arrived, both the correct and the disputed bill had been charged. I took this up with our operator Kuoni who implied this practice was not unknown! Kuoni said they would resolve the problem and asked for some time because often hotels don't respond quickly. To cut a long story short, Kuoni reimbursed us and behaved well. I can't say the same of Sofitel."
"The hotel picture of the pool are exactly what you get however the service is very poor.
The Pro's- Pool and day beds were great, comfortable bed in room, the service and greeting on arrival was good- massage was good
The con's- Just given a key, then its try to find your room, the service around the pool was poor, drinks were incorrect, wine was warm, lemon tart cost approx £12.00. The room we were allocated was 275- this overlooked the night club and on a Saturday night at approx 3am its a song of people's car horns that keep you awake- however when I mentioned to the front desk they are aware of this yet in a hotel 50% full they still put guests in them. On leaving the hotel I was chased and interigated over a bill of £7.00!!!! However I had already  checked out and was served by a gentlemen called (Hellum) who was incrediably rude and paid my bill which was a large sum of money. This gentlemen was the face of the Sofitel and he was an insult to a really good chain of hotels- this is just a bad one!!!! I really would visit Marrakech however I wouldnt rebook at this hotel sadly. 

Top tip - we were lucky to meet a trustworthy taxi driver who picked us up on time, Guijjane Abdessadek- +212667868977"
"The Hotel is a lovely building but it has problems . Our room faced the city and we were woken every night with terrible street noise and also at 4 am a blast of wailing from the Mosque. On the first day we were given a small free juice by the pool. Many of the small glasses were still by the pool and on the edge of the flowerbeds when we left . The pool area was not regularly cleaned. Also the 2 steps into the pool were broken and very dangerous. The restaurant food and service  was average and we expected better. On the third day I had to ask 3 times for our room to be made up , it was finally done at 4 in the afternoon!. We had an early flight on our last day so I paid the bill the night before . Then as we left the hotel at 6am I was accosted by the front door porter who demanded my room number . I asked why and he said he needed to check we had paid . I refused to give him my number and explained to him that what he was suggesting was not a good thing. I told him I had paid my bill . I virtually had to push him out of the way to leave the building . He then rushed to the front desk and the duty manager came out , recognised me and did not pursue the matter !!!  I do not expect this treatment in a luxury hotel. A very unpleasant end to not a particularly pleasant stay."
"The hotel is OK - no more no less - given a 5* rating. Service were in general slow and poor. Slow check-in: The receptionist asked for our passports, left us for 10-15 minutes (no welcome-drink provided), came back then asked us to fill in forms (including name, passport number etc - nothing filled in beforehand). Then gave us the key and left - without telling us where or how to get to our room! 
Cleaning of room were variable throughout the stay. First day we left at 9am only to return at 5pm to an uncleaned room. Housekeeping then came at 5.30 as we were showering and getting ready to go out for dinner. They asked 3 times the next 30minutes ,only to the same message from me: Come back after 6.30. I assume the cleaning lady did not understand english, so I called housekeeping and asked them to come back after 6.30. Provided drinking water were not resupplied this first day. Minibar not refilled. Shampoo was not resupplied. No price list of minibar. Later 3 bottles of water were suppled, only to no supply again. The room was OK, stained furniture in the room (bed linen were clean). 
Stained chairs in the L'Orangerie restaurant.
Had breakfast at the hotel breakfast restaurant one of the mornings ($25/person) - were seated by the head waiter who then quickly left. We were seated at a conference room of some sort next to the restaurant and with very bright lighting. No ambiance for breakfast for us. Table with stained tablecloth. No cutlery provided by the staff (had to pick it our self from a nearby table), no staff came to take order for coffee - had to look for staff and ask twice to get regular black coffee! And the breakfast buffet is cleared on-time: Make sure not to be late! Food was just okey - no value for money !
Then some pro: The staff are friendly and always greets you with a 'bonjour' or 'bonsoir' when you pass them. The concierge were helpful and friendly (though a mistake made us to arrive at a restaurant booked by the concierge 90minutes before it open - however, the concierge swiftly called a nearby restaurant as a replacement). Also pro: Nice garden and pool area.
All in all: Not the service you could expect, rooms so-so."
"Travelling with two young kids. This hotel is on a busy road. Rooms are old, noisy and dirty. We were given a room that smelled of sewage and could not get a replacement until late night. When threatening to leave we were  offered a replacement room that was old, dirty, with not working taps. Staff at front desk is unprofessional, does not pick up the phone and takes ages to perform the basic tasks. We booked a 5 day holiday and left after a nightmare of a night and a never ending discussion with front desk. I would advise not to book this hotel: there are lots of equally priced and better managed properties in Marrakech. Delano is across the street and miles better."
"We chose to stay in a riad to experience some character and the real Marrakech. Having visited the Sofitel for an over-priced pool day we were so glad we did just that! We were told we were not allowed to sit at the tables at the pool-side bar for lunch and had to have it brought to our sun loungers. Having paid £60 for usage of the pool area for the day and a further £44 for a bottle of water, chicken panini, coke zero and a small cheese pizza and to not be able to sit at a table to eat is ridiculous! Considering the price of the food one would expect it to be magnificent, however it was TERRIBLE. The waiter was very standoffish towards us. If they don't want people who are not staying overnight at the hotel to use the pool area then they shouldn't advertise it."
"My wife and I stayed for two nights in the hotel on a recent business trip to Morocco. Although the entrance, swimming pool area, dining area etc creates a great impression one would expect much more from the rooms and staff. I heard the spa was great and looks impressive but we did not make use of their services due to time constrains.

Our room was in the ""new"" part of the hotel but the overall quality of the room was poor, actually it was ""scruffy"" and rather something one would expect from a two star hotel. Many of the fittings in the bathroom (the shower head, the mechanism which should open and close the run-off water from the bath) were broken, carpets were dirty, the room smelly and the toilet (separate from the bathroom) smelled like raw sewerage. The ceiling in the bathroom also was in seriously bad shape. I suggest that this hotel review their cleaning and maintenance schedules and procedures to ensure that one receives a fresh, clean and properly maintained room.

Our room had a balcony but the view was onto a rubbish dump.

Although we arrived at 2pm our rooms were not ready and only got access to our rooms after 5pm. The staff generally was not very helpful or friendly and continued to serve me in French knowing that I (unfortunately) cannot speak French.

I will not recommend this hotel and suggest travelers look for alternatives in the same price class."
"Location and the pool are excellent but the rest is mediocre.
Most of the rooms are very noisy (close from main road)
Decoration of the room is really bad (compare to other hotels), it is just a standard sofitel with a light morrocan touch.
Only 1 entrance to the hotel, access to the room is complicated and very long.
Bad smeel in the corridors. Maintenance of the garden is bad."
"Dear Sofitel Marrakech, 

I am writing regarding an almost comical string of mistakes and mismanagement that very nearly led to my recent holiday at the Marrakech Sofitel Palais Imperial becoming a disaster, and certainly left me with a poor impression of your hotel. I would like to ask for compensation, as described over the course of this email. 

This email has been sent to Sofitel Marrakech front desk, Sofitel Marrakech reservations, and Sofitel head office and also posted to tripadvisor. Please cc each other in any response – the first response I receive will be posted to tripadvisor.

1)	Booking: We attempted to make a corporate booking through your reservations desk, Meriem was dealing with our request. The whole process was a disaster – entire strings of emails went unanswered for 3 ½ weeks, in the end in desperation we gave up and decided to book directly through the Accor hotels website. It transpired the ‘corporate rate’ Meriem had secured us (or would have, if she ever answered phone or email) was in fact substantially more expensive than your standard rate. We booked online. I booked a superior room with mountain view for myself and my travelling companion.
2)	Upgrade: We complained and Meriem offered us an upgrade to a junior suite by way of apology. I booked and prepaid for airport transfer for 600Dhiram each way through Meriem. Two days before our trip we reconfirmed that the upgrade had been put in place. We flew to Marrakech.
3)	Arrival: We arrive at Sofitel Marrakech. Check-in is slow but eventually (after being given another guest’s checkin forms, including their credit card number, name and address), we are checked in. I am given the key to room 277. I go up. It is a small double room, the carpet is peeling from the floor, there are brown stains on the bathrobes, the view is of the carpark, the windows don’t close properly so the noise from the adjacent road is deafening, and there is a strong smell of damp.
4)	Complaining: We come down to complain that the upgrade hasn’t been applied to our room, and could we please move to a Junior Suite. ‘But you have been upgraded to a mountain view room’ comes the reply. I say that in the first instance my upgrade should be to a Junior Suite, and in the second instance my room overlooks the carpark, when in any case I already paid extra for a mountain view. ‘No, you paid for a standard room – we upgraded you to a mountain view’. I show my original booking confirmation, for a mountain view room – the reply is ‘it doesn’t matter what it says on your confirmation – on our paperwork it says we upgraded you to a mountain view room’. I show the email confirming our upgrade to a suite ‘we have no suites available’. We ask to speak to a manager. Surprisingly, there isn’t one. The receptionist, whose name I think was Othoman, was rude, both in the content and tone of his speech. The best we get is a promise that the hotel will move us the next day, and refund us for the first night’s stay.
5)	Complaining again. The next morning, Saad (at reception) is very helpful – we will be moved by midday and at the time we will be told what our compensation will be – he agrees we should get the first night’s stay for free, and some free spa treatments, but he needs to confirm first with his manager. In the end, we move rooms at 4pm (hotel ‘systems’ were down so he couldn’t expedite room service to prepare the suite), still not confirmation of our compensation, as ‘the manager is still in lunch’. The next day, by the way, we are again three times promised confirmation of the compensation, which again and again fails to materialise – Saad is unable to reach his manager (here, a plea – I think Saad was the one person during our entire stay who attempted to help us, and I don’t want him to get into any trouble). Still, at time of writing, I have no idea if you intend to compensate as agreed. In fairness, the junior suite is delightful, well maintained, and has a view of the mountains.
6)	Insult to Injury: 5pm, and hour after we have checked in to our room. I have just showered, and am lying naked on the bed. My travelling companion is in the bathroom. The door opens (no knock) and two other guests enter. I wrap the sheet around myself and find out they have just been checked in – to my new room. They leave, embarrassed. I too am left embarrassed.
7)	Departure. I have prepaid airport transfer for 1200 Dirham in total to and from the hotel for my group. On my checkout bill is 250 Dihram for transfer from the airport, and 350 Dihram for transfer from the airport. I am in a hurry not to miss my flight, but it takes 20 minutes of showing my email confirmations and receipts to the receptionist before he begrudgingly agrees to remove it from my bill. I am left perplexed as to why you charged me double the price as an advance booking that I would have paid at the hotel. The receptionist says he will get the concierge to meet me outside the hotel and show me to my car. 10 minutes later, I go directly to the concierge and ask if my car is outside, as he has yet to come to meet us. ‘have you paid?’ he asks. Yes, I say, and lead him to the receptionist who helped me. The concierge takes another 20 minutes to be convinced that I may in fact be allowed to board the car I paid for. Incidentally, the journey to the airport takes about 5 minutes. I prebooked the transfer to avoid being ripped off by unscrupulous taxi drivers. I believe a taxi would have cost 50-100 Dirham each way, perhaps one tenth what you charged me, and then attempted to charge me again. I nearly miss my flight as a result of the delays at checkout.

I would like to know post haste how you intend to compensate me for the terrible service we received from initial reservation request to our departure.

I am taking an unusual step in posting this email to Tripadvisor – you can see the link here, in an attempt to expedite your response. To allow you the opportunity to redeem yourself in the eyes of the public as well as my own, I will post your reply to this email to Tripadvisor as well.

Sincerely,"
"The negatives experienced in this hotel are pretty horrific, yet there are several positives that mean you can't eliminate the possibly that one day it might work. The issues i experienced in staying at this hotel for 14 hours were;
1. Blood on my bedsheets that was from an unknown source. Not enough to suggest a prior murder, but too much to ignore even though it was not a full moon.
2. My pressing was 20 mins late in being delivered despite the Laundry Dept having 12 hours to press one suit and one business shirt.
3. The breakfast buffet was a meeting point for all the local flies.
4. No-one answers the phone. 

The positives;
1. They corrected point 1 very quickly.
2. Some of the staff are excellent. Especially on the Front Desk, although they don't seem to waste time to answer the phone. And the team in the flyzone breakfast restaurant try hard. 
3. The fountain outside.

"
"I'm very disappointed with the service. I'm a gold participant of le club program and I didn't have a welcome drink or an upgrad. The worst thing was: they put us in a bedroom worse than I paid for.
We complaint several times and spent 2 days trying to resolve the problem.
I've paid for a superior room with bathtub in the lounge and spa, the newest one. They put us in the palais royal, in an old room, noisy and with 2 twins beds together. We are still waiting for our luggages for more than 40 minutes.
Not what I expected."
"I stayed here for a conference about a month ago. I found the hotel to be perfectly nice - restaurants and facilites were fine - however it was a real ordeal getting any sleep. I stayed in a room facing the road, and between 2-4am every day there was loud shouting/talking, dogs barking, car horns and police whistles.On asking the hotel staff, they said there was nothing they could do, and that no other rooms were free. I was very unhappy with this, and as there was no other option I toughed it out for the next few days. I was very glad to be leaving after this continual lack of sleep. I certainly will not be going back."
"We booked luxury rooms with pool/garden view. On arrival were put in small, much inferior rooms where we would have remained had I not complained. Room 1 smelt of sewage & was very noisy ( due to patio doors not closing). Second rooms satisfactory but TV in son's room was broken & not repaired/replaced despite 2 requests. Reception staff unhelpful & evasive, with poor command of English. Five star prices but extremely weak customer services. There is plentiful luxury accommodation in Marrakech, so stay somewhere else."
"We were supposed to stay at this hotel for 4 nights but checked out after 2.  Here is the deal in a nutshell:

Good: 
1 - Excellent breakfast and Moroccan restaurant
2 - Nice public areas, good lap pool, gym
3 - 10 minute walk to the main square in the Medina

Bad:
1 - Noise, noise, noise - There is a major casino next door which hosts super loud, hotel rattling parties on Sat nights which go to 3 in the morning.  We had a ""Superior"" room. They showed us a few (in both the (Lounge and Spa side and the Imperial Side) and all had noise problems of some kind.   The noise isn't only from the casino, there is restaurant noise (unless you stay up till midnight), and street noise.  You can look at our other reviews, we rarely complain about noise.
2 - The rooms are nothing special - Motel 6-like
3 - Very uneven service as mentioned by many other reviewers. 
4 - Frankly, it is infinitely more atmospheric to stay in a riad in the Medina.  Like day and night."
"I can say on average is was a good stay with good beds restaurant breakfast  and staff but the overriding problem was the horrible AC noise from outside  which completely made any time in the room impossible.
We asked to be moved. This took 4 days . The new room was  great.
If you are unlucky enough to be put into the noisy wing  I feel sorry for you.
Would have been 4 stars but for the noise."
"First impression was the building and the interior design of the building which was we were expecting for as a palace. On the way walking in, we just hoped that our a-week holiday would have been unforgettable, YES it was horribly unforgettable one.

At the reception, the welcoming was SO COLD, 20 mins to get the check in process completed and get a room key. A guy who was checking us in, just left in the middle of the process (Dinner break?) and a young lady just took care of the rest without excusing or explaining anything to us, and we started again. (She said you filled in the form and I will be back) SO unprofessional. No information about the hotel facilities given neither any anticipation of our expectation. We discovered by ourselves each day. 

On the following day, we asked where we could find the breakfast room, a girl just point to the right and say it's just over there.

Poor service of the Pool bar restaurant even though the pricy item on the menu which we were ready to pay. A lot of staffs walking around doing nothing instead of giving attention towards the guests.

Many technical issues encountered during the stay, the room was not at all what we expected. Bed was not comfortable at all, A/C didn't work and etc.

Having walked and seen so many staffs on the corridor each day, they just ignored us, didn't even say ""Hi"". In general, the service was horribly far away from what we call Luxury.

Very disappointing and highly not recommended."
"The good; superb bar service and very good restaurant, great bed.

The bad; some pool staff seem more intent on catching up on gossip with their colleagues than serving guests.

The ugly; room not ready when we arrived.  Not a problem, we were given a voucher for a couple of drinks and told reception would come and get us when the room was ready. An hour and a half later, I returned to reception to find our room was ready.  They said our bags would be delivered to our room.  Forty minutes later I went down to reception to find that our bags hadn't moved an inch.  My laundry went missing.  Two visits to reception drew frowns and assurances that something would be done.  Two hours later I went myself to housekeeping and it was in my room within five minutes.  No hot water on one day of our five-day stay.  Yes, no hot water in our room.  Yes, it claims to be a five-star hotel!  

Despite all of this, we decided to extend by an extra night.  I asked at reception.  They said, ""It depends if we have rooms available.""  I waited.  I asked, ""Do you have any rooms available?""  ""I'd have to check"", was the reply.  I waited.  ""Could you check?"", I probed.  ""I'm sure we have"".  I gave up and booked online, despite the pathetic strength of the WiFi service.  ""Booking a hotel has never been easier"", claims the Accor site.  Unless you're using WiFi from an Accor hotel.

The Marrakech Lounge & Spa has undermined our confidence in the Sofitel group.  I'm a Platinum loyalty card holder.  I've been trying different hotels this week."
"The entrance to the hotel is impressive. So far everything else has been unimpressive. Our luggage took over an hour to be delivered to our room. And worst, our room had a view of a filthy green swimming pool and building site. When we asked to move we were told no. We asked if the hotel was full and were told it was not. So we asked why we couldn't move to a room with a better view and were told 'this was the type of room we'd booked' which is funny as I don't remember 'room with view of building site' being a booking option ...."
"i arrived frm another sofitel And i was so disapointed  .i almost cried.i i wanted to leave th notel .i booked a room frm travel agent and prepayed it with orporate card on my name but i didn't bring my travel id ...t d the reservtion you need t have iata numbe nd sprcial number that you from them..it s mposible that a nrmal erson would reserva these.at check in they made a big fuss and they wanted t charge extra 145 for 3 nights...the room was dirty , you can see that it has better times ..the lobby and all other facilities ar beautiful .i am alergic to dirt and had to go irectly t pharmacy to get the mediction so that i could stay in the room breakfast .really nothing pecial and they charge you big money .....lets admit it is beautiful hotel from outside and it hides a lot of bad things inside ...i am so upset that right now. think. will nev agin visi ofitel because it s not mgnifique"
"Location is the only thing good to say about this hotel. Everything else shows signs of very poor management; we were faced with inefficiency, incompetence and dishonesty everywhere: at check-in, restaurants, concierge, luggage check. Just few highlights of our stay. At check-in they could not accomodate us adequately or on time. Even when we paid a higher rate they put us in an awful location (we paid more for a better view and got a bunker view for our return stay). We spend 5 hours checking in and lost the whole day instead of finishing our errands on our return. Breakfast, which was a buffet, was covered in flies and cheeses were drying by the end of breakfast when we arrived. Bon appetit. Concierge was a peak of dishonesty, as they misinform you to say the least on any inquiry. Concierge offers you however a VIP car, VIP reservation, VIP service. What they forget to tell you is that you are treated for a fool. I would check all information at the internet center yourself. One outrageous example, yes there are trains and buses going around Morocco, it is sad to know that concierge was never informed. Another, it took them entire day to make a reservation for our dinner at a restaurant (""there are many restaurants at this hotel, it is fully booked, but we can get you a VIP reservation""). In the end, we called ourselves and made a reservation at the last moment, the only restaurant at this hotel was very empty and we had a very personal service just because we came. 
There could be worse stays,but you pay for what you assume to be comfort and this is what you are not getting at this Sofitel. Try however Sofitel in Rabat, which is quite a contrast."
"We stayed at this hotel for one night in July before catching a flight from Marrakech airport the next day. We were not very impressed with the service.

The front of the hotel and reception area are really beautifully finished, but we'd clearly arrived at a busy time of day and had to wait until we could complete the check-in. We were also not offered cold towels as other people have described. There is a really nice man who gives out mint tea in the reception and he brought us some tea.

The pool area is really nice but was so so busy - completely packed with people in the afternoon and it was nearly impossible for us to find a bed. There seemed to be a lot of beds with old towels on or that people had left their stuff and gone off for the afternoon. It took a long time to get someones attention to order some drinks and then they took a long time to arrive. The food and drinks by the pool were the most expensive and overpriced that I had experienced in Morocco, although the food was nice. The swimming pool itself is lovely. It seems like they should concentrate a bit more on the service of food and drink and not on a sunglasses shining service.

The room was fine and had everything you might need and the air-con in the room was good. The balcony was also nice, with a comfortable seating area.

On the last day I wanted to eat lunch in the hotel. I wanted to eat indoors as the temperatures were very high and the only place to eat is in the buffet restaurant at a high price. The only other option was the pool snack bar, which had no air-con. I only wanted a small sandwich and there was no-where to order one in the hotel and sit indoors (by this time I had checked out of room). I tried to sit just outside the reception area and get some food, however the woman serving in the area was very rude. This left me with a bad impression of the hotel.

There is a small clothes shop in the hotel lobby and I bought a few things. The woman serving in the shop was really friendly and chatty.

We also stayed at the Sofitel Essaouira and thought that the Marrakech Sofitel did not come close to the excellent level of service provided at the Essaouira hotel."
"We took 3 rooms for the people of my company. They all were facing the street where 2 big discos are. Because of the noise of the people and the disco we spent a very bad night (Fights and police presence included). We have to wake early in the morning, I left the room and went to work.
I found out that I had forgot the dressing case and my trunks.
I went back to the hotel at 6:00 PM. I asked them to check if it was there. After waiting for 30 minutes they told me that they hadn't found anything but that they would send somebody to check for the trunks in the balcony where I had left it. After waiting for other 20 minutes They said again that they would send somebody to check for it.
As I had to take a plane I asked them to check for it as soon as possible. No response. Then I asked them  for the official book of complaints, and assuming I was stupid they gave me an ordinary piece of paper. I then asked to talk to the supervisor, but of course he was not there. I Am back in Spain now. I called them but they had me waiting for 10 minutes on the line and nobody answered.
For sure an experience I don't want to have in the future.
Sincerely:"
"Having been spoilt for 4 nights at Riad Kniza (exclusivity & paradise) we moved to the Sofitel for a conference. Whilst this place presents itself well for a large hotel scratch the surface and the service s really poor. On arrival we were kept waiting for ages to check in despite being whisked into the 'quick' you have a reservation area! Aircon in the rooms works well but in other areas of the hotel it is poor. Pool is nice but be aware it is very busy with lots of  familiesThe concierge is rude and frankly useless, my transfer to the airport this morning was a shambles quite frankly."
"This hotel and its staff do not deserve the brand Sofitel at all
- the staff at the reception is inefficient and not listening to you at all: i booked a deluxe room with a view of the swimming pool ; the first room they gave me was a room on the first floor, with a view on the air conditioning ; when i came back to change the room, the 2 ladies at the reception said i can see the swimming pool on the right of the air conditioning and probably behind .... i needed to show my platinum status on Accor program to get a new room
- any request take at least 30 minutes ... when they even remember the request : i need to ask 3 times to take the luggages in the car !! at least they did not loose anything this time !
- the design is ugly, old and the rooms are quite dirty, especially the bathrooms
- the windows did not work properly and despite the calls, they were never repaired 
- it looks more like a 3 star hotel for vaccations group  .... in terms of space, staff and design
- be aware the view of the swimming pool include the view of a very nice and noisy 2 way roads, quite busy .... 
If i have an advice, do not go !!!!"
"I so wanted to love this hotel, it's beautiful and we were off to a rip-roaring start when we pulled up after our 2 1/2 hour drive from Essaouira with our three young boys and they had a bicycle go-kart course, which they loved.  Sadly, the came up against experience after experience of tragically bad service while we were there.  We spent only one night, as we were flying back to London the next morning. Our first issue arose from trying to get a crib for our room, which we requested at the time that we made the reservation.... and again on arrival.... and again when we brought our sleeping one-year old back to the room after dinner at L'Orangerie in the hotel.... and again an hour after that.  During that saga, we dined at L'Orangerie, which we had booked on arrival, however when we arrived they did not seem to have any record of our booking.  We had to ask for water for our children four times before we were able to have it served to the table.  We attempted to gain internet access both from our rooms and the lobby of the hotel, but the connection was so dreadfully slow that we were unable to download a single e-mail.  The next morning, when we arrived at breakfast at 7am, we were never offered coffee or tea and had to track someone down to get it after we had finished eating.  We then proceeded to the hotel lobby to find that our airport car reservation, which we had also made through the hotel, could not be located. They finally obtained a car service for us, however, we nearly missed checking in to our flight due to the hour that it took for us to find a replacement car.  And all of this for US$700, excluding our meal at L'Orangerie (which was very tasty, I might add).  I would look elsewhere if I were you!"
"My wife and I stayed at this hotel on 27 March 2012 in a junior suite, room number 528. In the afternoon of 28 March after we check out, I found my wife's pearl necklace was left on the desk of that room. We called the hotel immediately, but were given the answer of nothing found. We are definitely sure that the very expensive golden pearl necklace with platinum was on the desk when we left. We are given the answer of no by the staff even we asked them to check and ask the cleaning staff again. The only thing we can do now is to tell this true story here. I hope the manager could see this and check this again. This is a behavior of stealing to some extent!

On the other hand, the junior suite is very nice and cleaning, with beautiful view to the swimming pool. The staff is friendly especially the luggage man. Anyway, the unfortunate experience ruined our experience in this hotel and destroy our holiday."
"I'm still staying in this hotel. The breakfast buffet is great! The waiters there excellent but forget about the room service people and reception: 
It is the second day we ordered some french fries. Yesterday it took about 1 hour to get the simple ordinary fries!
Today, the first attemt took about 55 min! The freis where cold! The second attemt is still after 60min on the way! 
The receiption staff is friendly but incompotent! Our claim about noisy room was noted but they never followed it! 
The breakfast buffet is very well organized and the staff very helpfull and capable. It seems they have a good manager keeping a strong eye on them! 
I would say the whole service desire just maximum 4Stars and never 5Star!
If you stay for one or two days, good choice with a good price. For longer stays don't waste your money."
"What an experience, at the entrance you get your first shot of unwelcoming experience with large men - about 6 or 10 of them looking at you and in French tell you ""Pay entry fee"" about $25USD and for what, just to sit at the lounge and be charged another $25 for every drink. I will defiantly avoid such a place and prefer to go to a place where they are more welcoming."
"I'm afraid my hotel room and safe were broken into and the staff did not manage it well at all. There were many issues but in summary it took a long time for the staff to take us seriously, they tried to dismiss the idea that it happened at all, and the escalation procedure to get to management was extremely slow."
"We arrived last night. First issue: the reception clerk asked me to sign a pre-authorization credit charge amounting to about twice what my total hotel bill is likely to be. Second Issue: they could not provide a suite with twin beds for our daughters, claiming that had not been specified on the reservation. Third Issue: they moved us to the other older building where the rooms are priced cheaper but claimed this was simply a different concept and the price would be the same. Fourth Issue: the air conditioning did not work properly in that second room we had so that after two hours of unsuccessfully waiting for the room to cool, we were moved to a third room back in the section we had reserved. Fifth Issue: they claimed they had just moved us to a more expensive section (the section I had reserved and paid for) and would have to charge us more!!!! Sixth Issue: they claimed they had no evidence that I had reserved in the Palais Imperial section.Need  I go on?"
"I don't even know where to start.  I'm ctually here now for one more night and I'm trying to find a way to check out early due to the lack of service here.

First the good things so I'm not completely bashing the place.  We are in a superior room so the size and location are nice.  Also the size of the pool and lounge searing are plentiful and relaxing.  Ok.  That's about it.

Reasons why I wouldn't recommend this place to anybody:

-  when we came to check in we got here early at 1230.  They didn't have a room ready Whig was understandable since check in is at 3.  But the manager came out and said that we can have lunch and come back as our rooms would be ready at ""3"".  When 3 came around they didn't have rooms ready so my husband asked for the manager-  they stalled and finally he came out and said ""remember I said 3 or later"".  First off she didn't say that and neither does our hotel confirmation.  They ended up scurrying and giving us the first 2 rooms that were ready (we are a party of 3).

Second= the pool was amazing.  And the fact that they had a spa was the reason we chose this hotel amongst the Riyadhs.  I love going into the spa at night or when it starts to get cooler.  Oh don't get me started-  this spa was a good size and appeared as a spa with the signs that sai no children and it appeared that there were jets for bubbles-  but the spa was the same temperature as the pool at ALL times.  We asked the staff to turn on the bubbles and heat and they turned on the bubbles for 3-5 minutes which it would automatically turn off.  It NEVER got warm.  When we asked about the heat they said that they only heat it up in the winter.  The next day we were in the spa and it was cooler and other people were asking for heat-  we asked for the manager and the same one from the day before came out with her greeting as ""remember meeeeee?"". I didn't know how to read her obnoxious comment but after asking her for the heat she flat out said no and that the spa does not have the ability to be heated.  I find. This hard to believe since the last guy said they only heat it in the winter.  I don't like being lied to.  Then she said assured me that all jacuzzis are cold basically calling me crazy.  I decide to not use the facility anymore and go back to the room about 10 minutes later.  She apparently was watching me and came running after me offering access foe 2 of our 3 guests access to their spa where they have a hot tub.  I thought that it was rude that she would split up our party even after I mentioned we were a party of 3 adults.  Then she offered me to go to the managers bar and have a drink and ""think about it"".  Thy was my last straw.  Alcohol or unlomited soft drinks is not going to change how I feel to split up my party.  Also there were kids in the spa the entire time-  I have wonderful picture of it I will display when I get to the states.

Next complaint is very few people here speak English or Arabic for that matter.  French is the main language.  We attempted to call the concierge to find out how to retrieve phone messages.  We got transferred to housekeeping, the restaurant and the spa just because nobody speaks English.  When we finally retrieved our phone message it was my family expressing concern whether I was even there.  They had a difficult time reaching our room-  A half hour on their dime.  For a 5 star hotel they should have somebody who speaks english available at all times. 

Lastly I'm having breakfast now that's costing an arm and a leg for a Buffett when I know I am not going to eat that much.  They told me to go to the cafe terrace as I can order a la carte.  I walked there with my friend and the staff were talking to their friends for a good 5 minutes before helping us.  We looked at their pastries on display in their glass case which I will post a picture of-  and the pastries were SWARMED with bees (which I'm allergic).  When somebody came to help us I asked what was on their menu an they mentioned the pastries-  I asked the ""ones in there with the bees on it???"". Her reply was simple ""if that bothers you, I can go to the kitchen and get you another one."". Really??????  Gross!  Definitely not 5 star quality.  

Needless to say I'm unhappy with this hotel.  I've jotted down the general manager's name and will be writing a detailed letter as soon as I get home.  Their managers are worthless so I'm hoping he may he a tad bit better.  Whatever you do- avoid this hotel at all costs -  you're wasting your money. "
"Stayed at sofitel marrakech for 5 nights and the experience was far below expectations. The rooms were uninspiring and felt like a 3-star hotel. We were allocated a room directly opposite the air con units that hummed constantly, they would only move us at an additional cost.

The room service menu is extortionate and the food is average. Although the reception area is very stylish the service in all areas were pretty poor. The pool bar is a joke, staff ignoring you, having to ask several times to be served. This went on time after time.

The pool is very busy and we found it difficult to find any space. 

Sofitel looks like a 5-star in the pictures but the rooms, service as well as the high prices for food and drinks make it a poor option to stay at."
"Spent a week here with my girlfriend. If you want a relaxing holiday, other than sunbathing round the impressive pool area, there's very little to do. If you are going to go worth boking half board, as the prices round the pool are ridiculuous eg £10 for 2 coffees!.

Our room was quite small and very noisy. Opening the door onto the exteremely small balcony led to loads of noise. Also, there was no air conditioning and although we complained, they did very little, very slowly. Unless you speak fluent French, they can't understand you.

Gnerally, unimpressed with the hotel, the surrounding areas. The only attraction is its proximity to the walled City.

Dont bother unless you want to be stressed and feel ripped off.

On a positive note, it has the most amazing pool area with fantastic sofa beds to sunbathe on, but the poolside prices are crazy."
"When we arrived (@ 11h30) , the room wasn't ready and there were some problems with the VISA-system. After letting us wait for about a half an hour, the room was 'ready' and the VISA problems were solved. Once in our room, we checked the minibar and noticed that it was not completely filled. Also the shower gel in the bathroom had already been used. Some small problems we could life with... But when I decided to take a shower, the real problems began. After about 5 minutes in the shower, the bathroom was flooded by water and the water temperature was changing all the time. On our second night we arrived in our room @ 20h45 and we noticed that the room hadn't been serviced. The beds weren't made up, the towels hadn't been replaced, ... So we went to the reception to notice the problems, but the lady at the reception just gave us an extra key for our room (???). Thats also a real problem: there is some staff that can speak English, but most of them only speak a little French (but even in French they don't always understand you). After explaining the problem in English AND french, they told us they would send someone to our room. So we waited again for about 45 minutes till someone arrived. He told us the lady of the housekeeping had already left the hotel, so he made up the bed. We told him the room was messy and needed some cleaning, so he left the room and after again a half an hour he came back with another guy. They cleaned the bathroom and put roses in the bathtube (to please us, I think..) But they didn't vacuum the room (photo), didn't clean the closets, ... So we called the supervisor and she did appologize for it, and she promised to deal with all the problems the day after. The 3rd day, the room was clean, but the shower still wasn't fixed and on the bed, the bed linen was worn out (photo), and the bathrobe was dirty (photo). I can go on like this forever with all the small problems that make this hotel not worth it's 5 stars! Also the price for breakfast and drinks is really too high. 25 euro for a breakfast?! In the city you can have a really good one for about 2 euro! 
So, to conclude, the hotel really has to do something about the quality of the rooms, the speed of the service and the language knowledge of its staff, otherwise they will have to deal with a lot more of negative comments in the future I suppose... 
It has to be said that Sofitel tries to keep its name high by sending appology mails, saying they will deal with the problems or by giving us some biscuits and slippers. But that's not the way you treat unhappy customers! Just give them some biscuits and they will shut up? Think again ;)"
"This hotel looks like the discarded leftovers of a W property.  The bed was inattentively painted a tacky silver and the room was cramped and dull.

We called for a box to have some of our accumulated souvenirs sent home; after 3 or 4 separate phone calls to different staff members, each of whom assured us they'd send a box right over, we never got our box.  On one of those calls the staff member mentioned that the hotel did not offer a mailing service but that he would be contacting a third party to come get our stuff and would call us back.  He never did.  We left early the next morning and had to find some temporary packing material at the airport to get our stuff safely on the plane.  Fortunately, an airport baggage-wrapper attendant was far more helpful than the Sofitel, and, shockingly, our souvenirs survived 2 connections back to the United States.

The room service food was really poor, but the hotel wasn't all bad: the Sofitel luggage-handlers and doormen couldn't have been more gracious.  Sofitel would be better off letting them run the hotel than such an uncaring and inept front desk.  

There are many better hotels and riads at which to stay in Marrakech."
"Very disappointed by this hotel. 

I had the worst food ever, especially at pool restaurant. Every guest was disgusted by the food there. 

Worst service ever, you can wait for room service hours and never show up !!!

You hear every heartbeat from your neighboors room !!

Never back there , not worth the 5 star price. 

May better choices in Marrakech."
"This hotel does not have wifi for free. They say that it is impossible because the hotel is so big but the connection in the room was excellent. This connection will cost you 9 euro every hour. The wifi connection in the lobby was free but most of the time it did not work.
 Although sometimes there were rose leafs on the bed, bird dirt was on the balcony and on the table on the balcony. During our stay of four nights, it was never clean!
The hotel did not provide a decent map of Marrakesh. There were no newspapers, no use of computer free of charge. In the bathroom there was no body lotion, no razor nor thoothbrush. On the carpet in the room were many, many stains. 
The first night we ordered a bottle of wine, the same we drank the night before in the Sofitel Fez for 290 Dirham. Here the same bottle was 410. Late check-out, although it was confirmed, was a problem. The room was needed at 15.00. After a lot of fuzz, it was not needed anymore and we could stay in.  Most of the people at the reception were arrogant and unfriendly. Never had such a bad experience in a 5-star hotel. Since there are many alternatives, do not book this hotel!"
"Wow. Where do I begin? Oh right, let's start with our arrival. I am not exactly a world traveler, but my wife and I leave the US at least once a year for vacation. We had never been to Morocco, and I had never been to North Africa. i don't speak Arabic or French, so we were counting on some help in the form of a pick-up upon our arrival. The Sofitel assured us multiple times that a driver would be waiting when we disembarked in Marrakech. Well, there was no one waiting. That forced me to try and find a phone to call the hotel. Not an easy task. finally, the Budget rent-a-car guy took pity on me and called them for me. after getting transferred twice and hung-up on once, i was told to ""stay right there."" Btw - every other arriving passenger seemed to get picked up, including La Mamounia ( the nice hotel where we should have stayed ) who's drivers were waiting at the gate in uniform. finally, our guy arrives sweating profusely. his fez was askew. he apologizes. keep in mind, as we later learned, the hotel is literally ten minutes from the hotel. it's not like he had to cross the desert. anyway, we get to the hotel and sat for an hour during the check-in process. finally we are sent to a room with a stained carpet and chair, a broken toilet paper dispenser and no working a-c. this will not do. so, we complained. they moved us to another room on the fourth floor which was apparently being renovated. so, we walked through the hall to find all other rooms on the floor with their doors wide open, carpets ripped up and mattresses lining the halls. it looked like the overlook hotel from that movie ""the shining"" on the last day of the season. it took us threatening to leave to finally be assigned to a decent room. just an awful experience. the Sofitel really has to get it's act together. the Marrakech experience permanently soured me on the brand. not to mention how much money they charged for breakfast. for those prices, these guys need to step it up. I don't mean to be nasty. I tried to focus my ire at them on an internal company survey, but predictably it didn't work properly. Sigh."
"English breakfast - £30.
One orange juice, one coke (in a can) - £12.
20ml bottle of cheap sun lotion - £25.
1 hour of internet access - £8.

When paying £180 per night for a room, I was rather disappointed in the pricing structure for basic services/goods. We had planned to spend most of our time in the hotel and grounds, so decided on the Sofitel due to the excellent pool area. However, we were quickly put off of this due to the above. A day at the pool would easily have cost £100 per day for us. We instead decided to see more of the city, and spend our money elsewhere.

Fruit delivered to the room was a nice touch, and the maid service is very good. The analogue TV was at least 10 years old and most channels were out of tune/bad signal.

We wanted to make a purchase from the boutique but there was no staff there. The concierge response was that it was closed. Although the doors were open and lights/music on...

Location is just outside the Medina walls, but rooms facing the pool have to endure endless moped whine and car horns til around 1am. Soundproofing those rooms would have been nice.

Not the experience I was hoping for, although Marrakech is certainly an interesting place and I am glad it forced us out of the safety of the western hotel and into the real Morocco!"
"If you enjoy lack of air conditioning, lack of hot water, business center that is inoperative, and restaurant with service so bad you leave, then this is the 5 star for you. This hotel has a beautiful location and lobby, but as far as I am concerned, that is where it starts and ends. We would never, ever stay here again, and it unfortunately has made me question my choice of Sofitel elsewhere."
"The reception is the first impression you get of a hotel. It seems that the Sofitel doesn't really care about that. Reception staff is rude, unfriendly and does not even attempt to help or resolve problems. Maybe they should retrain the pool & garden staff for reception duty as they are very nice and friendly.
Hotel is o.k. (beds were terrible though) but far over-priced. They charge 100 MAD for an hour internet which is ridiculous. We will never stay there again and will take a nice Riad next time instead."
"If luxury means bad attitude and condescending service than Sofitel is the place to stay!  If you look at the website it appears as if there are two Sofitels in Marrakesch; the Sofitel Palais and Resort and the Sofetel Hotel.  They are in fact one and the same hotel with one wing being the ""resort"" and the other wing being the regular hotel with check ing desks at either end of the same lobby.  They both share the same pool, restaurants and ameninties so don't be tricked into paying the higher price to stay in the ""resort' side.  
     I had requested a nonsmoking room and the first night we were ushered into a room the smelt like stale cigarette smoke and had so many cigarette burns in the carpet, I could not begin to count.  Although the terrace was nice it was always a challenge to clean the pigion droppings.  The room albeit spacious was very tired and in need of updating.  The carpet was rippled, the wallpaper peeling.....
    When I asked the concierge about hiring a car to go to Essouria I was given a lecture about only hiring the hotel cars and becuase times were slow I could arrange a special deal with him and he started to bargain, like in one of the souks.  I do not expect this of a concierge nor of a supposed five star hotel.  The location is slight away from the Medina and there are few amenities around.  We found the best coffee shop to be at the hotel on across the street from the Sofitel and the restuarants at the hotel to be over priced and over rated.  Find a nice Riad and you will probably be much happier and pay a far better price."
"Finally got to sit down to write my 2 cents on this one ...
We went there for 3 days . I thought that it was expensive but as you know the wife won as they usually do . Nothing prepared me though for the rip off prices in the hotel . Absolutely shocking ! How can they justify that is an absolute mistery to me . Don't get me wrong we travel a lot and stay in good hotels but this was far too much . Not only the service is very poor , we there waiting for a sandwich by the pool for 1 hour ! I sat there waiting for a waiter to come talk to me for 30 minutes then decided to go to the bar myself, they were all having a chat , then tried to involve me in the conversation so I just said : 'Can we have some service over there ...' Cheeky sods ! then the rooms we stayed in what they call 'prestige suite ' what prestige ? A suite with no cofee maker , and old TV that looked like my gramma's , no ironing board , i mean seriously  for Stg 400 / night.
Then you've the staff in reception , there was a lot of empty rooms in the hotel but they just refused to move our friends to a decent room ( not overlooking the hotel's rubish dump) when they finally did they moved them to the next door room , go figure ! 
Basically the hotel is ok but that's about it . 
Don't expect service , don't expect a smile from reception staff and don't expect a superbe room .
Room service was good though I must admit.
If you happen to stay there by mistake , well use the caf / restaurant not far from the hotel. It's much cheaper , good service and very good value for money."
"This hotel doesn't deserve it's five stars. It is all show and nothing else. It's like the designers built the entrance, reception and pool area and thought well that looks impressive, we needn't bother putting any effort into anything else!
I rarely splurge on expensive holidays, don't get me wrong I like to travel to exotic places and stay in beautiful surroundings, but I rarely stay anywhere 5 star and when I do I expect it to be worth the money. In the past this has been the case however,  I have never recieved such poor service in my life. When we arrived we handed over our expedia booking details to a woman (certainly no lady) on reception who asked us to take a seat, she then ignored us for 45 minutes. Fair enough the reception area was busy it was midday and people were coming and going, but to ignore people sat in front of you for such a long time is in my opinion dispicable. No offer of a drink to boot. But what tops that is that when we approached again she didn't even have the decency to apologise! Outrageous. A belated emotionless apology came when she finally developed some observation skills and sensed my annoyance. I couldn't even complain I was that livid. Plus I got the distinct impression she couldn't care less that she'd left us waiting so long.
As I say the hotel reception and pool is very impressive, in terms of decor at least, however the rooms weren't exactly special, devoid of personality and could be likened to a travel lodge. Very disappointing given that Marrakesh is home to such fantastic interior design and the sofitel claims to be a luxury 5 star hotel.
I felt like I wasn't able to relax fully by the pool as the drinks prices were just ridiculous. I think it was something like almost £4 for a large bottle of still water, and similar for a can of coke or sprite. Very irritating when it a cost you can't avoid. What planet are these people on! I'll tell you what planet they are on, one where they are busy designing a food menu for dogs, (yes really!) while they forget about the needs of the people they should be serving. When this £4 drink arrives, don't be suprised if it takes a good ten minutes to get to you, and you'd be expecting too much it seems to expect a clean glass to drink it from or ice cubes made from mineral water, so you can enjoy them without consequence.
We were lured into booking this hotel by the impressive looking pools, which were lovely, it's just a shame we dehydrated at the side of them to avoid remortgaging!
What a let down, enough to put you off luxury. 
Get your act together Sofitel, you could be so much better."
"This was my first stay at a Sofitel, although I have traveled extensively in various countries.  I will not be staying at Sofitel again.  The hotel looks very nice when you check in, but the beauty is superficial.  The valet virtually refused to leave my room until I gave him 100 dirhams (10 euro) - he just stood in the door smiling at me, with his hand held out.  Taxis were not permitted to enter the grounds - the taxi queue was at the next street corner, where every driver knew to overcharge the Sofitel clients.  The pool staff was completely useless.  Most of the chairs around the pool were broken, and every day we were told that they would be replaced with new chairs the next day.  Never happened.  The most surprising thing at the Sofitel was the horrible food - truly the worst hotel food I have ever experienced, and also the most expensive.  The breakfast buffet (20 euros per person) included hard, dry pastries, a poor selection of cold cuts, and the worst coffee I have ever tasted.  Everything was straight from a tin or jar.  The one sandwich that I had the misfortune to taste at the pool bar could have passed for dog food.

Unfortunately, Marrakech does not have many choices if you are looking for a full-service hotel.  Try a riad with a pool!"
"Only stay in this hotel if you get a discounted rate. We stayed in a Deluxe room, and concur with other recent reviews... the room was dated, the carpet faded, the furniture stained. And the noise from the Hotel's bar (even after midnight) was a real problem for us trying to get to sleep. Our television picture was far from clear, and despite politely advising the concierge, this was not corrected. The doormen here are really polite and friendly, but I dont recommend asking the concierge for help or advice. He is arrogant and only interested in up-selling you onto some kind of tour deal..possibly because there's a commission in it for him. His advice left me feeling uncomfortable, and I felt treated like an idiot. He is not an asset to Sofitel, by any means. He is condescending in manner, and  borderline rude. The pool is nice, but nowhere near as amazing as the marketing photos would lead you to beleive. The room was big, but I am not sure how a deluxe differs to a standard... dont bother upgrading your room type. The fridge was old and barely worked at cooling down anything. I wouldnt stay here again, and have been really turned off Accor Hotels after my recent round-world trip... they just dont compare to smaller chains, and independants.I definately didnt feel treated like a valued guest here at the Sofitel. I stayed at Le Meridien on my last night in Marrakech... and while the service is more relaxed, I enjoyed it much more than the Sofitel."
"We regularly stay in Sofitel hotels in different countries, and were disappointed by the Sofitel Marrakech.  It is not up to the usual Sofitel standard.

We were impressed by the standard of customer service - staff were very polite, particularly the doormen.  We also loved the fact that the hotel was filled with the scent of fleur d'oranger in the evenings.

What we didn't like was that the room's decor was dated.  The thick carpet felt dusty as did the beds (we were constantly sneezing).  We were also quite shocked to find that the doors linking our room to our neighbours' were not locked, meaning that we could walk from our room to the next!  The sound proofing was poor, we could hear everything going on in the next room.

Nice fitness centre, but it is a shame that you need to pay extra to use the hammam.

Breakfast buffet is OK, but not great for a Sofitel."
"We are Sofitel Privalage card holders and I have to say I have rarely felt less privalaged! I find the reviews here staggering in their praise of this Hotel which frankly we couldn't wait to leave.I would recommend reading ""kceese's"" review ""unbiased review"" - rather than repeat it all I would just add from our own experience.

We had stayed at a Riad for our first 5 days then after a trip south had wanted a calm hotel outside of the Medina. The Sofitel seemed the best and obvious choice. We found the reception on arrival so unhelpful it bordered on downright rudeness. The room was okay but not great, the hotel is large with lot's of facilities buit the overall manner of the staff really lets it down. All were curt, preoccupied with talking to other staff members and generally unhelpful. Breakfast was fabulous - I ordered tea, it didn't come, I asked again (nicely!!) and had two pot's of water slammed on the table so the water flew out of the spouts. The waiter then started a heated argument with a collegue who reprimanded him right in the middle of the breakfast room. A manager was standing nearby - didn't say a word. That summed the hotel up for me. We moved to the Meridian which possibly wasn't as smart but the staff were a delight. Frankly I'd choose one of the wonderful Riads (we had stayed in La Sultana for our first few days-superb) or if you want a Hotel stay at the Meridian next door."
"My husband and I have spent a couple of days in the Sofitel Marrackech at the beginning of August. 
The Hotel does not lack in luxury and the attention to details when it comes to decoration is amazing...a mix between modernity and tradition. A term very often associated to Morocco itself. Although the hotel lobby and other common areas were nicely decorated i have to say that I was quite disappointed with the room themselves. They were very simplisctic and some of the furnitures looked quite old and the carpet and armchairs were stained.
We arrived at 11am and were asked to be seated in one of the numerous comfortable sofas in the lobby and were treated to delicious moroccan mint tea. I found the check-in process a bit long considering there were only two people checking in at the time. Even though we filled the check-in form properly the staff kept referring to us as Mr & and Mrs Nasir (my husband's first name) It was clear that they inverted the first and last name and did not really pay attention when I was correcting them. Check in was not normally until 16pm and they asked us to wait for the room to be ready. I requested to stay in a temporary room while waiting for our room which the receptionist agreed.
When enterring the room we could not find a room service menu so called down Room service who soon delivered one... I found the menu expensive even to UK standard and very limited in choice. 1 beefburger + cheese pasta and 2 moroccan tea came at 430 dhrs. It took 50 mins and 1 phone call to have the food delivered (the person on the phone was quite impatient.The food was tasteless...
When we finally changed rooms, it took 40 mins and 2 phone calls to have our luggage delivered.
Breakfast  was good but then again service was slow even though staff are friendly and helpful. selection is good. 

When we were relaxing in the swimming pool, I went to the bar and asked if it was possible to be served some refreshments in the pool area. The waitress refused and offered us to take a seat in the bar instead, I explained to her that my husband was waiting for me in the pool area but we may come to the bar later.  So I left to get some magazine inside the hotel and the waitress ran after me and finally agreed to serve us in the pool ( I don't know if she was doing us a favour but I found her behaviour quite strange). I explained to her that I was going to get magazines and that she can prepare the tea in the meantime and when I'll come back I'll show her where we are seated. When I came back, she asked if she could prepare the tea... So I had to wait.
On our last day, we missed breakfast times and requested to have breakfast served in the room instead as it was included in our package but the receptionist was quite hesitant. I had to call her after 10 minutes and she said that breakfast in the room would incur a charge of 150 dirham per person. 
We later stayed in a Riad in the Medina, and in hinsight, if you want to experience the real Morocco, you are best to book in a riad even though knowing that you have the luxury to use the pool after a long day of sightseeing is a plus. I understand the reviews that said that the staff can be arrogant..and very french. it's true that if you don't speak either french or Moroccan it's quite difficult to get by and the staff don't make an effort at all.
"
"Arrived at the Sofitel, and was greeted by a smiling receptionist.  That went down hill, she kept tapping her foot as she was waiting to show me to my room.  I was putting all my paper work away.  Arrived in the room, not slippers, no complimentary water.  Went to the bar, the time in 22.00hrs, asked for a coffee and was told no coffee, I challenged her, this is a 5 star hotel.  Same answer no coffee.  Next morning had a shower, bathroom flooded.  Phoned reception, was moved, complained about the tapping foot receptionist, and the no coffee waitress.  Was informed someone would come and see me about this.  I'm glad I never held my breath, wouldn't be here to write this revue.  Did e-mail customer services, got a reply, a big sorry from her and a big sorry from the General Manager, big deal.  Hoping I would not be put of from going to a Sofitel hotel again.  The still never gave me an answer to my question, even though I e-mailed them again, did not even get a reply.
"
"this looks like a 5 star, but the service is shocking.  On the days we stayed out club sandwich took 2 hours to arrive and the next day an hour.  the staff serve the french people first and so the english group bribed the staff with cash to get service.  Even so you may have to ask 3 or 4 times on average to get a drink, or a cup to pour your breakfast into.  Our arabic speaking friend in our party also heard waitings staff openily swearing at the english in arabic between themselves in the poolside bar bar.

the faciliies are great, the spa and the pool, but this is not 5 star.  It is also very very expensive in the hotel - be warned!

check your hotel bill or pay cash - none of our bills matched up, some got less, some paid more.  Totally random!
"
"I've given this hotel a rating of 1.0 because it is supposedly a five star hotel, the service is appaling and it's awful value for money.  To be honest, the service would be fine in a Travelodge, but given what they're charging, it's shocking.   I'm a big fan of Accor hotels, I frequently stay in Sofitels, Novotels and Etaps, but this particular one is a joke.  

I don't want to rant on and on, so I'll try and keep this short.  

Arrived at the hotel.  Receptionist told us to take a seat.  She then has her photos taken by a photographer doing a shoot at the hotel.  Completely ignores us, chats to him for 20 minutes.  Finally she directs another receptionist to help us.

We specifically asked for quiet rooms, away from the main road.  Given rooms next to the main road.  Complained.  Told that all the rooms were next to roads, hotel full, nothing could be done, but we'd be moved the next day.   Next day nothing happened.  When I asked why we hadn't been contacted, I was told it was up to me to chase the hotel, they didn't have time to run around after guests.

Buffet lunch an eye-watering £25 per head.  No prices displayed.  Had to ask for drinks no less than 5 times.  Told we couldn't sit at the only vacant table, we should wait in the bar for 10 minutes because the restaurant was ""too busy"".  

Despite advertising three restaurants, only one (the most expensive) is open.  The buffet was closed throughout our stay.  Dinner consists of French food, nothing at all Moroccan on the menu, and cost just over £150 for three for one course each and one bottle of wine.  

Breakfast buffet lovely, but service terrible.  Asked for coffee three times, didn't come.  Had to clear our own table.  

Outdoor pool is absolutely freezing.  Not sure whether the guy who thinks it's warm swims in the North Sea every day, but I defy anyone to swim in that cold.  If you want to use the inside pool, you have to pay £20 each just to go in.  The guy serving drinks by the pool works his tips really hard, alleging that he can only take cash payments because it's impossible to charge to the room.  

Internet is charged at £40 for three days.  You can use the internet free in Accor's cheap Etap hotels, so why on earth you have to pay to use it in Sofitel amazes me.  

I could go on and on (we stayed for four nights).  But the general theme was rubbish service, and prices three times higher than you'd pay outside the hotel.  

We did complain and they obviously realised they'd screwed up as on our last night, whilst packing to go home, we had a massive basket of fruit, nuts, cakes and sweets delivered, and loads of fresh flowers put in our room.  They even managed to screw this up, by putting a card on saying ""Welcome to Sofitel Marrakech"".  Clearly they didn't know the English for ""sorry"".  

On the plus side, the rooms are nice, and very good double-glazing does keep out all the noise from the street.  Location is not bad, about 20 mins walk from the square.  

But if you compare how much you'd spend on a Riad, where the breakfast is normally lovely and the service great, you'll cry if you waste your money here.  Remember, Morocco's still a pretty poor country, most of the staff will be earning about £200 A MONTH, so Sofitel is making an absolute fortune here.  It is completely inexcusable that the service is universally so dire.
"
"My wife and I booked our honeymoon at this hotel. Unfortunately due to health reasons we were forced to cancel our booking. I called the hotel two weeks before our proposed stay and explained our situation. They told me that the booking would be cancelled and we would not be charged. I also asked for an email confirming this which they promised to send immediately. After a week of waiting and chasing them up I received the email stating that the booking had been cancelled and confirmation that no charge would be made. 

A couple of weeks later, and to my amazement, they debited the entire amount from my bank account for the now cancelled stay. 

I have called them a dozen times. The staff's English language skills are dismal. My calls were put on hold or passed from one person to another, and promises of calls to be returned to me were not kept. And most frustratingly, they would not let me speak to the hotel manager directly. This is appalling practice. 

We have tried everything to try to get back our money including contacting their head office in Paris, but to no avail. Their reply is that this booking was apparently an 'RA1' booking (whatever that is!) which they say is not refundable. We were NOT told of this before booking and there was no mention of this in any paperwork, despite their claims that it was. 

We feel betrayed and desperately disappointed by Sofitel Marrakech and the Sofitel hotel chain. It took four months, six phone calls to Morocco, Paris and London and numerous emails simply to get an invoice for the money they took from us. Completely unacceptable and unprofessional.

My advice is avoid Sofitel hotels and in particular the Sofitel Marrakech. Terrible experience. Avoid like the plague.

"First of all, book only some rooms with pool views (from the superior room), because the other have terrible views. The hotel is perfectly located in the Hivernage, and this is its main advantage. The staff is not helpful, the rooms are noisy, and you should take your own bath amenities because the Hotel provides terrible products...

"We have just returned from a week in Marrakech. The whole experience was disappointing to say the least. We arrived at the Sofitel at 11.30am and were eventually, after finding our luggage, settled in our room at 4.10pm. The room with balcony and pool view that had been booked was not available (hotel was full) and we were given a small, dark and depressing room with no outlook. This was refused and eventually another was found and we were charged 30E per night extra. The concierge and reception staff were less than helpful.  This attitude continued throughout our stay. The hotel was not in a convenient location and we were advised not to walk too far and to take taxis (inexpensive - but don't tell them that you are English because they double the fare). Breakfast was adequate; poolside snacks expensive - £10 for a meat baguette, £3.50 bottle of water/beer. Entertainment was non-existent. The hotel was overrun by 'corporate hospitality' involving large groups of suited persons talking loudly into mobile phones. The room was not serviced until late afternoon which could be inconvenient. There was no tourist information available and we were faced with a look of distain when requested some.  

Would we recommend this hotel? No"
"Stayed at this hotel for 1 week.  On arrival thought hotel looked very pretty.  However, the service was very poor.   The staff I encountered were more concerned with looking good than providing good serivce.  Saw many complaints during my stay.  

On arrival we were given no information e.g. breakfast times etc.and the information in the room is very misleading.  When I telephoned reception to find something out, they kept transferring me back and forth between different lines - no-one wanted to deal with a simple request - in the end I gave up.  Currently building work opposite the side of the hotel which was very noisy and prevented sitting on the balcony for long.  Also people leaving the night club in a nearby hotel woke me up at 3.30am every morning.  

Would not recommend this hotel to anybody.

"We stayed here for 2 days during Christmas. All I can say is “average” from the shampoo to the concierge service if not worse especially for the café. I don’t want to be unfair to staff since we’ve not been mistreated but the staff and the service was simply amateurish. The hotel definitely lacks the charm that you see at first sight. It would only serve the purpose if you are visiting Marrakech on a business trip and know where to go what to do etc.. to minimize the time spent in the hotel premises. Otherwise total waste of money.
"
"The entrance and public rooms are splendid, and check-in is very quick and easy, including the omnipresent mint tea.  That's where the service ends.  After being given our keys the receptionist asked if we had luggage and when we said yes, in the car park, she walked away.  We presumed it was to get a porter, but no one ever appeared.  After wandering around looking for the elevators and our room, we finally had to ask at the cashier's desk how to find our room.  When we got there, it was hotter than hell and even after running the air conditioner for an hour it didn't cool down.  In fact, the air outside was cooler than the air in the room.   After dragging our luggage from the parking lot up the stairs to the lobby a porter arrived to offer his assistance -- after all the lugging and dragging had already been done!  The lack of service was downright comical.  And the air conditioner never worked.  And the room (room 468)overlooked a highway where loud diesel traffic was racing by at all hours of the day and night, making it nearly impossible to fall asleep.  Then, to add insult to injury, at checkout we were told that the room was covered by the charge to my credit card, but not the room tax, which needed to be paid in cash.  Since it was our last night in Morocco we had not budgeted for this surprise. Basically, the service is atrocious and the hotel is a longish (and unpleasant at night) walk to the medina.  Once La Mamounia completes it's renovations, we suspect that the Sofitel will no longer be able to rest on its laurels and treat its customers as poorly as it currently does.

"We chose Sofitel based on a previous great experience in Mauritius, but this hotel was dreadful. There were so many complaints that we did get upgraded after we took our list to the duty manager. The main problems were lack of service and lack of staff, we never once found a clear table to sit at at breakfast and to get one cleared was an immense effort........then there was no food, no plates, etc etc. The staff themselves were visibly overworked - there were just not enough of them. Same for the pool area - no beds ""just sit on the grass"" was the comment.  Empty sunbeds with magazines on were infuriating!  Pool freezing.   It could be a good hotel (though it's looking rather ""tired""......time for a renovation) but they are overwhelmed by the amount of guests and the restaurant, pool area and number of staff are grossly inadequate.

If you go, don't choose school holidays!"
"Sofitel Marrakech

Booked a holiday to Morocco staying at the Sofitel Marrakech for 7 nights.. As the title suggests the jury is out regarding this hotel for me.
The transfer from the airport was trouble free and there are plenty of ATM’s in order to get currency.

We arrived at the hotel at 1130 only to be told that the room would not be ready until 1530hrs, which was a pain. The room we were given overlooked a building site complete with workers staring in. The room was fairly dire in that there were cigarette burns on the carpet and dubious stains on the bed linen (covers) We politely asked to move but was advised that it was not possible. The evening didn’t improve, we had room service and the staff member demanded a tip and to cap it all he only brought one set of cutlery. We didn’t get much sleep as there was a evening convention/party across the way from us. 

If the first day was a bit of a let down day 3 was a test of nerve. Our safe with our money/cards etc malfunctioned and couldn’t be opened. Staff were not that concerned and we had to wait to the following day so that our valuables particularly our money was free and we could go out. The same thing happened on day 4 at which point we generally wanted to go home.

When our tour representative herd of our difficulties she arranged for a change of room via the concierge who was very helpful  The room was far better and faced the back of the hotel, generally it felt clean and a higher standard I suspect the first room we got tended to be used for tour groups. 

Generally speaking the communal areas of the hotel are without question 5 star standard, but the rooms and service are well below standard. Breakfast was amusing as you had to beg for coffee and staff would generally ignore you. 

Im aware that I may sound a combination of high maintenance/grumpy old woman but im generally a fairly chilled out person, I just felt that I paid a lot of money for a 5 star hotel and received appalling service.

As for Marrakech proper, its everything I thought it would be, vibrant, noisy, diverse and full of character.
We made full use of the taxi service which was very cheap. From the hotel you should pay no more than 30 d single fare to go to to Djemaa el -fina. It is here where you gain access the souq’s. We went during the day and got very lost, so heaven knows where we would have ended up during nightfall. That said and done we often went into the square proper at night and tried eating at one of the many stalls selling food. It was a little like tapas as in many dishes, but all the food looked and thankfully tasted very fresh all of which was very cheap.

We went on the tourist bus which was handy as you could hop on and off at your whim. The ticket lasted 24hrs and cost 120 D
In ville nouvelle (new city) tried la Trattoria serving Italian cuisine. You walk through iron gates into a converted mansion and have the option of sitting in or outside, outside there is a lovely pool setting. A meal for 2 came to about 50 pounds.

Another restaurant within the Medina is Dar Marjana which is in a converted Riad which again is in a beautiful setting. A nice touch on the way out is that you are escorted down an alley way by persons carrying lanterns.

Consider going on a day trip to Essauria which on a coach is 3 hours each way. I have to say I would have preferred to stay here than Marrakech. it’s a smaller affair but plenty going on including a beach if that what you want. People are less in your face and its 10 times cheaper than Marrakech. There are some wonderful seafood restaurants along the harbour at reasonable prices.
Marrakech museum again is worth a visit, it has a nice little terrace café which a welcome relief from the hustle and bustle of the medina.

Any way, I apologise for my somewhat disjointed review, but hope it assists in some way. 
Would I go back to Morocco? Yes I would probably to Essauria on a short break or a tour of the country. But I wouldn’t go back to Sofitel there are so may other places (cheaper that offered clean rooms and good service.

"This hotel looked really impressive when we got there....But the service was really bad....The first day the waiter at the restaurant where we were having lunch forgot half the things and it took about an hour just to get a sandwhich and a few chips....also everything ie. food and drinks were so over priced.....
My advice would be for the hotel to get extra staff....they were just so unorganised .....i mean they had one waiter by the pool area 
to come round by the sun beds(which he hardly ever did) so that we could order the drinks.
The choice of food for Vegetarians was better in room service so we had to have lunch in our rooms rather than by the pool (like most people do when they are on holiday)
I would never go back to this hotel....Although the concierge was really helpful....oh and yes as please do check your bill!!!
I would not rate this hotel as 5* more like 2* with that kind of service!
"
"The Sofitel Marrakech is on the whole a great hotel, with the excellent value for money and great service that you would expect from a country which is rapidly developing its tourist industry. 
Our big disappointment was when we got back home and checked our credit card statement...we had been overcharged by exactly 50%!. I phoned to complain and I was told not to worry...after at least 10 phone calls, some where they simply hung up on me. I eventually received confirmation of their error and now await repayment. One further annoying fact about this hotel (especially as we travelled with a person with limited mobility) is its size and layout. Its like a maze and it could easily take 20 minutes to get to reception....beware!

"My husband and I have just returned from a weeks holiday at the Sofitel Marrakech. As befitting a large 4/5* hotel the exterior of the hotel was as grandiose and luxurious as the plush website pictures depict, with an attractive fountain and outside seating area decorated in the rich paprika like brown and reds so typical of morocco. Once inside the hotel we were equally impressed by the large inside lobby area with its marble like floors and prompt and friendly service from the Moroccan reception staff. Check in was completed whilst sitting on one of the many lobby sofas which certainly made a welcome change from the usual procedure of queuing and standing.

We paid for a standard size room using the hotels own ‘Hot Deal’ website offer (about £75.00 per night), and made our way to our allocated third floor room. Whilst the room and bathroom were both very clean, for a 5* hotel we were still a little disappointed by the comparatively small room dimensions and also the abysmal view from the balcony overlooking a dusty building site. We had asked prior to check in for a room with a better south facing view but the hotels only response was to offer us an expensive upgrade to a deluxe room. As we had travelled during the July/August low season period the hotel was only about 25% full and so we found their refusal to accommodate our request to be unnecessarily unsympathetic. The complete absence of any tea or coffee making facilities in the room was also a shortcoming keenly felt, not least because we resented having to pay the extortionate room service prices (a bottle of water costing 5 dirham in the medina costs 30 dirham in the hotel!). Other irritations included an empty and switched off mini bar and the fact that only CNN was available as an English speaking tv channel.

Housekeeping was also unacceptably poor as, despite having our ‘Clean Room’ sign clearly displayed outside our room hours for hours at a time, we frequently returned to an unmade room. On one occasion, even after having made eye contact and gesturing to one of the cleaning staff in the room next door we still came back to an unmade room. Even in a 3* hotel you would never expect to have to physically call housekeeping every afternoon to ensure your room was cleaned. Buffet breakfast served in the hotels ‘Le Palmier’ restaurant was also a somewhat shambolic affair with staff rushing around, and I would certainly agree with a previous comment about certain members being less than enthusiastic to attend to you. We found the selection of croissants, breads and yoghurts to be adequate but were very disappointed by the limited availability of hot American style breakfast foods. A good tip for a better and cheaper breakfast, as mentioned previously by other reviewers, is to visit ‘Table du Marche’ just across the road. 

Upon check out we were presented with a bill for an additional 400 dirhams for ‘lodging tax’, something which was never mentioned on the hotel website and which I initially refused to pay. After much heated discussion however with an again very unhelpful and surly member of staff, and with our flight leaving shortly, we eventually agreed to make the payment just so we could leave the hotel. 

Although the communal and pool areas of the Sofitel Marrakech are undeniably spacious and luxurious, the general level of service we encountered at this hotel was unacceptable for a supposedly 5* establishment. Whilst I do acknowledge the overwhelmingly positive commentary bestowed upon this hotel in previous reviews, I simply cannot recommend anyone stay here after my own poor experience.

"We have just returned from a 3 day break at this hotel. Having booked a standard room we were given a room with a balcony overlooking a building site so beware. When requesting a change the staff were very unhelpful and asked us to pay extra for an upgrade and then showed us a twin room as an alternative which was unacceptable. Wasted 2 hours sorting problem out. Service at breakfast is poor with the waiters keen to avoid you rather then attend to you. Otherwise, nice hotel.

"This hotel opened a couple of years ago. I think it used to be another hotel before, unoccupied for a while, which was then refurbished in 2002.

The hallway is very impressive. Wonderful Moroccan decoration.
Nice swimming-pool and garden, although a bit noisy due to the main road nearby.

Buffet breakfast is excellent and offers a great choice.
Their Mediterranean restaurant is very good too.
Nice bar but rather noisy at night... I'll explain later on.
Service is good and smiling.

We were on a rather cheap package basis (plane + hotel), so we ended up in a regular standard room. Nice deco but room was on the small size (15 sq. meters), but with a large balcony giving on the swimming-pool. We were not so happy again to note that we could hear our neighbour's talking or watching TV next door...

In the middle of our stay, when coming back from dinner one evening around 11 PM, we found a note from the reception begging us for this evening not to use the bathroom since there was a huge leak (unnoticeable for us) flooding the room underneath. They would move us to a similar room the next morning...

When my husband saw the memo, he jumped on the phone and started complaining... saying he wanted to have a bath right now and nobody would prevent him from doing so, specially since they wanted to move us the next morning to a similar small room...

His phone call may have had some effect since they called the Duty Manager who then assured us he would do something about the room the next morning... So husband remained calm (did not take an additional bath...)...

Next morning comes and we check at the reception about the room...
We pack our clothes again and the groom takes us to a huge suite (large living-room + large room, ca. 80 sq. meters) with a huge balcony giving on the swimming-pool and with the nice view again on the mountains.
We are thrilled of course... give the person a nice tip and invite my parents-in-law who had joined us for this trip for an aperitif on the terrace.

Everything went fine for the rest of the week apart from the last night where a group of people kept on playing music and singing in the bar downstairs until 4 AM...

And in this suite, as well as in the regular room, we could enjoy the conversation of our neighbours... Thin construction walls, no sound insulation... which is again not of a 5 star level !!!!

But I can't say we did not like this hotel. The place is fine, apart from the internal noise problems.
