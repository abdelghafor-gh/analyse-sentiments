"This hotel has the worst service that I have encountered in a hotel. We requested a room service menu to be told someone would fetch one and this was ignored. Asked again at reception,  that night, and was told again someone would bring one up. Again ignored. Phoned reception to request it and told again someone would bring one. No sign of the menu. Eventually went down to reception and waited there and one was produced from behind the desk. I ordered a simple meal (cheeseburger) and it took 50min to arrive at the room. This is not what you expect from a 5star hotel. 
Additionally, the bathroom drain is clogged and stinking but the windows don't open to allow in fresh air. The TV does not work, the Aircon control unit does not work, the minibar fridge is broken, and the second room key doesn't work. Their appalling attitude to customer service is not ""how can I help you?"",  but ""why are you bothering me?"". NOT GOOD ENOUGH! I would steer clear of this hotel."
"Room was good as we paid for an upgrade. Very comfortable.
Liked the roof garden although service in the restaurant was chaotic.
We had booked a pick up from the airport which was all agreed and paid in advance but waited an hour for nothing to turn up. Complained to reception who were dealing with numerous other complaints. No apology until I demanded compensation for the taxi we had to get. This is clearly a nice hotel but sadly lacking in any good management as no-one seemed to know what they were doing."
"Beware of price traps.
The prices in the menu in your room is an ""old"" menu. Once you ordered they will charge you with ""new"" price, which is much higher. 
Brought this up to the manager, they shown me the new ""new"" menu, and offer no compensation. 
"
"I don't really know what the point of online check-in If my reservation is cancelled without any notice or even a call.. and the hotel is changed without informing me in advance to transfer me to a worse hotel in a black car that I do not know if it belongs to someone who works there or to the hotel
I wouldn't even think about drinking coffee there anymore."
"I stayed for 3 nights for a business trip. Rooms are clean but definitely need to be refreshed. Breakfast is ok but details need to be adjusted. The organization in the SPA is a disaster, confusion, no respect of resevation time. I do not recommend"
"We stayed one night on the front end and one night on the back end of our week long vacation. Rooms/hall were not as clean as they should be for a hotel with such high ratings. Dirty carpets, weird odor in hallways. They did not have the chocolate hour (either night) that they advertise they have every night. They gave us a room that was already occupied. Breakfast was ok, and probably the best part of our stay. Pool was ok and maintenance responded quickly when guests complained about being cut by cracked tiles. It was overall ok but not 4 star."
"Hajar guest relation, ON business in Casablanca, from Canada, staying at the Mövenpick hotel, I was extremely disappointed as I had air conditioning problems for the first 3 days. Every day I was told it was fixed and every day it wasn't. I finally got help and a working AC thanks to the continued efforts of Hajar to get the right person to fix the problem.
Finally I was able to be comfortable in my room. Thank you Hajar."
"After a long flight from Canada, I arrived to the front desk at 4PM to check-in. I prepaid my 3 night stay over 3 months ago using Expedia/Hotels.com only to find out that they did not have a room available for me! She said I would need to wait for a transfer to one of their ""sister hotels"", bc the floor my room was on had problems. When I asked specifically what the problem was like electric, heat, flooding, etc., she had no answer and looked surprised I was asking for details. It was then that I knew they overbooked the hotel so I asked to speak with the Front Desk Manger.

I reminded the Front Desk Manager that over the past 2 days I had been receiving upgrade offers for this hotel and now they had nothing so what gives. He checked his computer and said ""we have an upgraded room for you at no cost that will be available in 5 minutes""! Having time to reflect on this business practice, I would advise every customer to re-confirm even prepaid bookings bc it seems that this hotel overbooks the low level rooms in hopes that customers will pay a discounted upgraded room hours before they actually check-in. 

Be sure to re-confirm Room Reservations!!!

"I'm very disappointed with this hotel as I had just stayed at the Movenpick in Marrakech and had a delightful experience. This experience was not the same at all. The rooms had superficial updates in the bathrooms, but the carpet was old, dated, and dirty. The bed was hard, which some find comfortable, but I did not. Many of the rooms smelled of smoke (we had to go to 3 different rooms before we found one that didn't smell bad). The front desk was not very helpful (again compared with Marrakech where they were amazing). The food was not very good and very expensive. The wait staff and porters were amazing however. "
"My husband and I stayed at the Movenpick Hotel Casablanca from 28-Sept-2023 to 12-Oct-2023. We chose the property based on previous Movenpick stays in other countries and the 5-star rating. The room (an Executive Room, 1 King Bed) was pre-paid via Expedia prior to our arrival. A few days before our trip we received an email from the hotel regarding the availability of an upgrade to a Deluxe Suite for an additional $35 per night (a total of $490). We confirmed the upgrade.

From the very beginning, our stay at the Movenpick Hotel Casablanca was very unpleasant. The hotel is FAR from the 5-star rating assigned to it by many travel sites and the management company (Accor Group), and is not on par with other luxury hotels in Casablanca. The problems we encountered are as follows:

1. Decor was outdated and looks like it has not been renovated since it opened, although signage in the elevators stated recent renovations.
2. Lobby area has a drab, 1980s modern black, gray, and white color scheme. Furniture consisted of lacquered tables; black, gray, and red sofas; and dingy rugs in some areas. There was a large, circular table inside the main entrance with a vase holding a substantial, dusty, fake floral arrangement.
3. Walls and ceilings were white with black smudges (dirt). Floors were old and the baseboards cracked and dirty. Overall appearance was not inviting.
4. Our room (the upgraded Deluxe Suite on the 14th floor) was quite spacious (this is the only positive). The first night, we noticed the double sinks and tub appeared clogged as drainage was slow. Bathroom door was installed incorrectly and when opened, would block the bathroom sinks. Pressure in the toilet was not adequate and required multiple flushes. Additionally, there was no storage (chest of drawers, dressers, etc.) to privately store clothes, personnel items, etc. The next morning we reported these problems and the hotel moved us to another Deluxe Suite (on the 12th floor, in the exact location as the previous room). Although the suites were suppose to be identical in layout, they were not. Our second suite only had one sink in the bathroom. Although, the drains worked, the toilet still required multiple flushes. However, the bathroom door was installed on the correct side.
5. Tile in bathroom surrounding tub was old and cracked. Base boards were old/dirty and small paint chips from worn areas were visible.
6. Housekeeping was inconsistent with cleaning. We constantly had to call to get towels or soap that were not replenished during cleaning. Complimentary coffee/tea supplies were not replenished daily during housekeeping services. In-room coffee machine looked as though it had never been cleaned (We did not use it!).
7. Wifi/internet services in the hotel are terrible. Most of the time the televisions did not work because the bandwidth was too low for the feed. It was impossible to stream content on our personal devices because of poor wifi access. Hotel General Manger informed us that the management company (Accor Group) provides the internet for the hotel. He has complained to them about the poor quality. We contacted hotel reception on several occasions to get the wifi problem resolved. They were unresponsive or extremely slow to respond, and some technicians appeared incompetent.
8. Hotel staff were not helpful in looking for solutions to problems. Customer service was severely lacking and the concierge desk was useless! There was only one staff that made a concerted effort to help us when we had a question/concern.
9. The food in the hotel was atrocious. Potato chips served at the rooftop restaurant smelled and tasted rancid. The pastilla (one of my favorite Moroccan dishes) I ordered one evening was so bad I could not eat it. It was flavorless, dry, and looked like a hockey puck. The omelets ordered appeared to have canned instead of fresh mushrooms and contained eggs shells on a few occasions. The food was so bad that we went to the Four Seasons Hotel when we wanted to dine in a hotel.

We could go on and on but these are the key points. My husband and I met with the General Manager a few days before we were to head home. We pointed out all of the problems we encountered and let him know how disappointed we were with our stay. He tried to provide us options to make our remaining few days more pleasant, but the options were more of the same. However, we demanded that we not be charged for the $490 upgrade and he complied. 

The Movenpick Hotel Casablanca has a long way to go before it truly reaches 5-star status. Do not bother with this hotel, you will be very disappointed. Instead, book with the Four Seasons like we should have done, which was impeccable!

"The staff was friendly, but this is definitely not a five star hotel. The elevator was suspiciously creaky, the floor smelled reminiscent of port-o-pottie chemicals. The room was spacious and beds were comfortable, but everything inside was crooked (light fixtures, pictures, hooks.) It had a generally dingy feel with dirty grout, loose bathroom tiles, the plate on the light switches fell off in my hand. Plus extremely slow draining drains.

I will say- we did not complain, because we were only staying one night before catching an early morning flight. But I have stayed in nicer Motel 6’s."
"We booked to stay 3 nights.The hotel without our knowledge debited our credit card which was held on record at the time of booking.
Subsequently it turned out that we couldnt travel there as my husband was unable to fly due to a sore back .We live in the Southern Hemisphere. We gave them a couple of months notice and said we wished to cancel due to health reasons.The hotel refused to accept that and kept the 3 nights payment! Said it was non-refundable. They weren't out of pocket a cent! We have never ever set foot in their country  and gave them so much notice! 
To make matters worse, a month after we were due to have been there ,they debited our credit card yet AGAIN  for another 3 nights! Shocking! We have stayed in many hotels before but never been treated like this. Disgusting."
"To anyone traveling to Morocco, this hotel is the worst hotel to stay at. Reason: Unhappy with the quality of stay
Comments: I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with my recent stay at Movenpick Hotel Casablanca on May 25th, 2023. Despite arriving late afternoon, about 4 pm, the upgraded room was found to be extremely messy, the beds were unmade, there were dirty towels on the floor, and the bathroom was not cleaned and was disgusting, also appeared to have had more than 6 persons staying at this room prior to our arrival. An alternate room on a higher floor was assigned but the noise level at night from above could not be tolerated and kept us up all night. Finally, at about 3 AM, I called reception and complained about the constant noise coming from moving furniture/equipment above the room, and about 4 am after my call the noise stopped. Suffice it to say, we were never able to sleep and were very tired and exhausted for our return trip to Marrakesh.

Upon checkout, the manager informed us that someone in a higher position would contact us by phone or email to respond to the complaint and compensate our stay.  June 21st, they finally replied and offered 1500 loyalty points for the most unpleasant stay at a Movenpick hotel."
"Can please somebody tell me how it is possible to give 5 stars to this hotel? Rooms ok, pool big enough for one family, breakfast variety poor, very old hotel that requires renovation, smell everywhere. We book one night and happy that we could go to another hotel."
"If you want to stay at a hotel that allows drunks to harass young women, and continues to serve them alcohol despite yelling profanity at other guests, singing lewd songs at the top of his voice, and breaking glass by the pool, this is your hotel. Despite numerous complaints by several guests, hotel staff did nothing. It seems a drunk paying customer is more important than the comfort and well being or female guests. Instead of a relaxing afternoon by the pool, it was stressful and very uncomfortable as he danced and sang at the top of his voice. Very disappointed that an international hotel with such a good reputation would ignore a handful of polite and patient Canadians and 2 school aged french girls. Shame on you for not stepping up. Feminism is not alive and well in Casablanca."
"I ordered a double room and was cramped in a single with one bed. The room has visible dust . You could see it on the walls. And we had to ask for house keeping multiple times because they would skip our room. The female attendances at check in and check out were rude and curt, never smiled and often gave me and my friend attitude, very nasty. The rest of the staff were nice . The staff at the restaurant on the 16th floor were beautiful ! Kind, smiled, often tried to help us and the hookah and food were good! The BEST PART of the hotel. "
"The room was dark and the mattress was like a brick. The water from the shower goes all over the bathroom. Everything was clean and the staff were incredibly nice. But I would definitely look at staying somewhere else if I were you…………………………."
"Hotel staff were inexperienced and did not seem to know how to do their jobs. Front desk did not pay attention to details, sky bar broke a bottle next to us and left glass all over without bothering to clean it up and spa was the worst experience I ever had in the world. I question the validity of the masseuse."
"Unfortunately, there is a big difference between Movenpick years ago and the Movenpick of today. my last visit was really bad. my room was dirty, the furniture was old, in the only a few channels worked, the lamps on both sides of the bad were broken, the water pressor in the bathroom was too high, and the second day there was no water in the toilette. We asked reception to change our room, but they were unwilling.
The breakfast was poor. i tried to accept the situation and enjoy my time in the hotel. the last day we had dinner in the top floor there we found a lot of people who were not hotel guests and some women dressed in appropriately. i asked one of the waters if the people where hotel guests and he confirmed that they were not, which means that anybody can come and go in the hotel as they please, so the hotel is not secured.
this was my last visit ever to this hotel."
"It was bad experience 😔 for me the receptionist lady she doesn't know initing about reception procedure just she asked me about I'd after that I paid the room charges and I got my keys with out iny information for the facilities in the hotel . 
I hope for her to get training for the process for checking 
And check out . 
The room was very clean but no dental kit and but Rob no slipir no iron Ac and freezer it was not worked the security staff very helpful 👍 

I wish to get my points rewards for this stay ."
"Room was outdated. Elevator was scary. Bathroom was falling apart. No shower gel available and only 2 towels when we checked in for our anniversary. Room was too small and the phone was disconnected. This hotel does not deserve more than 2 star rating. The lounge was okay. No one acknowledged our celebration. Staff kept talked loud in front of the guests which I’m professional."
"cranky elevators. electricity and a/c problems in most rooms. had to change 3 rooms until i found calm. not clear how they are on the same chain where other cities worldwide are so much better movenpick. this one is outdated and not well maintained. the rooftop is nice but is really separate from the hotel."
"A/c did not work and electricity went down few times. Had to change 3 rooms until a reasonable one that was not too small .  Mediocre breakfast . Rooftop bar seems nice. But I will not recommend this outdated hotel. They need to renovate their crappy elevators as well."
"- 2 hours delay for check-in 
- not clean and has a bad smell
- worst AC ever 
- room service didn’t add towels to my room and I need to call them for towels 
- location is in the city center and this is the only good thing about it"
"The staff here are terrible always staring and in general racist! Dont bring your family here or dont come at all. Other people have shared the same experiences. They literally put racist signs up and look at you differently depending on where you are from truly disgusting."
"We came with an orgenized tour at dinner time. There was not enough staff at rlthe dining room, not enough foood and no-one to talk to. It happened again in breakfast- not coffe, not even hot water..the dishes of vegetables, cheese was empty.  Poor service.."
"Very old furniture, not clean , you smell the smoke in a non-smoking room. The bathroom is not well maintained, no Shattaf. No Qibla orientation neither no prayer Matt .
No reserved parking area , the location is very crowded ☹️
I will never repeat this visit to this hotel."
"I am upset that I even have to give this place a 1 out of 5, it should be -5.  Compared to any other Movenpick I have ever been in this was by far a horror show from beginning to end.  The staff was rude at best, very stand offish and argumentative, even aggressif at times.  I was their on a business trip with 11 other people and everyone had the same experience, hellish !!  The rooms had mold, they smelled are were very dirty, when you asked to be moved you got worse.  Be ready to party because every night you can here the dj music until 3am, dont' bother moving, it is heard from every room.  An employee sneezed in the buffet food in the morning and did even wash his hands after wipping his mouth and nose...there is a fishy smell on every floor as soon as you get off the elevator, my guests thought it could be leaking gas pipes, it was horrible.  We had breakfast included yet were charged extra for it and had to fight for  days straight to have it removed.  I would rather sleep outside on the filthy streets then stay at this hotel ever again."
"I am a CEO and a business traveler who is staying 90% of the days in hotels around the world and I never got this experience. 
I checked in at 11 am on the 6th of Jun 2020.  they upgraded me to a suite which wasn't ready and checked before my arrival. So i asked some stuff that were missed and undone. 
At 11:30 i called the reception because of the air conditioning which wasn't working. They told me that the technicians are repairing it and it will work very soon. At 13:00 i met Majid at the reception who it ""seems"" don't know about air conditioning problem. At 15:00 I went back to the reception to talk directly with the front office manager assistant Mr. Mourad  Saber, I was frustrated and i explained my case because it was like a torture for me staying in a room with more that 30 degrees.  Mourad Saber kept smiling in my face for no reason and he told me that he doesn't have any idea about the problem. He told me he will call me back in my room which he didn't do. Actually he left the hotel after that. 
Angry and frustrated i went down and the receptionist called Mr. Tarek Kardoudi who was really honest (the only one) and kind. Mr. Tarek explained that all the air condition system is under renovation with could take 2 weeks. 
Unbelievable! I can't imagine the culture on the management who allows its team to lie in front of the client and i couldn't forget the yellow smile of Mourad and the mockery showing on his face. It was an unprecedented experience in my life.
How can Movenpick has this standard, this culture and hiring this kind of people??? 
It is not the full story. But this is more than enough to write a review, hoping it will help..."
"I stayed here for three nights for business. The hotel room was super dirty and smelled like mold. The bathroom had water damage and was growing mold on the ceiling. The cleaning service never replaced my water- in fact I was almost done with the first bottle I received and when they cleaned the next day, they just put the “complimentary sign” back on the used water bottle. They also did not replenish the vanity kit that was clearly used. They just put the empty box back in place as if they refilled it. The part that made me the most mad was when I can back to my hotel room on day three with the “do not disturb” sign. They took the sign down, cleaned part of my room and then left a clear display of opening and using my perfume that I had zipped up in a bag. Will never be returning."
"Stayed here for 3 nights on a prepaid business trip, if it weren't a time consuming headache, I would've switched hotels.  The entire place needs some urgent TLC, as others have stated- the smell of sewage is apparent on most of the floors.  A lot of spot cleaning going on, with an obvious lack of deep cleaning.  Careful of the elevators, some shake so bad or door creaks open so slowly it's completely possible someone will get trapped inside.  Egg station workers not using gloves and one fork to mix all requests as well as transfer finished items to plates.  No ATM on site, nor did they have enough cash to exchange money.  All of the staff I encountered were extremely friendly, it's obvious that they have to apologize for the state of the hotel often.  It's unfortunate because it is in a great location."
"I called to speak to my wife and the reception was soo didnt event want to listen to my request he kept saying she is not there he didnt even took time to check and at the end she is there. You dont feel any kind of attention. I definitly wouldnt recommend it  i called 15/02/2020 morning time"
"A club had just opened in the basement of the hotel and since then it’s even worse There is no isolation system and it’s not sound proof 
I do not sleep my bed keeps moving in with the bass sound system even if I put earplugs it is terrible and unbearable  Besides that there is a big problem in the sinks in the bath tubs it keeps flooding with nasty water how many times I couldn’t take a shower before I go to work."
"If this was a normal two star hotel, I would say that everything was fine, but this is a Movenpick Hotel chain that does better than fine, and we expected that. We would say our stay was more akin to a Best Western or Holiday Inn rather than a Movenpick. However, we booked Movenpick because we are always impressed by the attention to detail by the staff, excellent service, and delicious breakfast buffet. 

The staff were not very helpful. It was my birthday, and I wanted a pedicure. Unfortunately, nowhere in the room was there a number to call the salon. So I walked upstairs, and waited over 20 minutes, and no receptionists or staff of the spa appeared. I spoke to someone in the bar, explaining I just wanted to book an appointment. He spoke to someone who was giving another client a massage, and she told me to come back in an hour, I asked if I could please make an appointment, and she said no, return in an hour. I returned in an hour and was told that all the staff was busy and that there was no way they could fit me in today. This experience with the staff and spa was very drastically different than the impeccable service we received at the Movenpick spa on the Dead Sea in Jordan. 

We ordered room service, but were initially interested in the advert we saw in the elevator (in French) for the New Year's special. I did my best to translate the French, and saw there was a special menu and event happening in the restaurant, but when we called the desk to inquire about it they were very confused, unhelpful, and hung up on us. So we ordered room service, which was disappointing since we chose the Movenpick knowing they would have an event for New Year's eve. The room service was only okay. The first time we put our order through I ordered Moroccan Salad, but they called me back 15 minutes later to say they were out, so we ordered a different salad. The food was only okay, it was definitely not as delicious as the Moroccan food we had been served in other hotels and riads. The fish needed to be cleaned and cooked better, I stopped eating it because I was tired of picking fish scales off my tongue. 

In addition, we book Movenpicks because we love their breakfasts. The breakfast was only okay. It was much smaller in regards to selections and options, and the food was cold. There were no staff to create fresh pancakes, so I had cold, old ones that had been sitting out. There was no self service stand for coffee or tea, and no waiters came by to offer us any. We were surprised by the lack of service we received compared to the flight attendants who were pampered by the staff. They received fresh coffee in to go cups, and staff magically appeared out of nowhere to make fresh pancakes for them. 

My husband and I are both teachers, and to stay at a Movenpick is a splurge. Normally we are pampered and fell it is worth the splurge, but this time unfortunately we were not."
"I'm not sure if the 5 star rating on previous posts were written by actual employees pretending to be guests (Yes, I'm calling out those with 1 contribution) because this hotel does not even deserve 3 stars. 
When we arrived, the front desk staff gave us a room that was still occupied. It was a non-issue so we just went back and got a different room. It turned out our new room (#501) was huge but needs a major overhaul. The fixtures have seen its days and the carpet was filthy. The hallway was rundown with wall panels coming off the seam  and the worst part was the nauseous smell of sewage which the hotel tried to mask with a diffuser. Since the smell did not creep into our room and we were only staying for one night, we let it go. My husband and I also thought it was an isolated incident. But when we spoke with the rest of our group, a good number also complained about the sewer smell in the hallways and the rooms. Most requested a change and they claimed the front desk didn't even bat an eye and just handed them the key card to a new room.
The only positive comment I have for the Moevenpick is that the breakfast and dinner at the restaurant were good and the roofdeck bar was a nice place to hang out. Other than that, there are many other options in Casablanca I wouldn't even consider this hotel again should I return to Morocco."
"I stayed here in November 3 nights as part of a tour group. Our room was very disappointing. The room door was broken and we had a hassle getting it fixed, there was mold in the shower, broken trim and old carpet. 
This hotel needs some serious refurbishing. 
Surly there are better hotels in the city."
"my husband and I were in Casablanca for an overnight stay in October. we were booked for a room with a king size bed. the room we were assigned did not have a king size bed, not only that-the refrigerator and air conditioner were not working. the refrigerator was replaced and we were told that the hotel was having problems with the air conditioning but it had been fixed. upon retiring for the evening, we started hearing loud music. we were on the 2nd floor of the hotel and unbeknownst to us this was above the lobby bar!! we attempted to sleep through the music and several complaints to the front desk(no the air was not working still), we finally asked to change our room. we were moved to the 7th floor with a king size bed and air conditioning that worked. upon check out in the morning and voicing my dissatisfaction-I was told that I would be credited the buffet breakfast charge of MAD400, but to please not write a bad review. I asked for a credit of my room charge, but was told it was too late-it was paid in advance and could only get a credit for a future stay. I would never go back. certainly no comparison to their sister property in petra which gets high marks"
"Stayed over night and our last night in Morocco also just to be close to the airport. The property is old but clean somewhat. 
Check-in was slow. Room has no coffee or tea amenity, minibar was empty so not sure if that’s the standard of Mövenpick or they just forget to put, anyway we didn’t bother to ask.
Only 1 restaurant was on operation, the rooftop bar so we ordered room service for dinner. Food was cold, tajine oily ( horrible after the tasty tajine we had in Marrakech and Tanger) and bread that comes with it was hard. Soup lukewarm. We are so tired from our long trip from Marrakech that we just didn’t bother to return the food and wait another 45mins for fresh ones( if they are capable of preparing decent food.)
Noisy due to the night club on the ground floor so didn’t get much sleep.
At least water in the shower was warm.

We were glad morning came soon enough and we can leave the hotel to catch our flight.

"
"The hotel is no where near 5 star. Its old and has a sewage smell in rooms. Beds are uncomfortable and hard. The worst of all is that it has a nightclub with loud music until 3 am so good luck sleeping. I called them 5 times and even threatened to call the police as I had a very early morning flight and I couldn't sleep at 2 am because of the music. Stay away from this nightmare of a place."
"Don't expect the level of standard you normally get at a Movenpick. Rooms need to be refreshed, walls dirty and crumbling, rooftop pool very small, Hotel is located in a very busy,noisy section of the city. Overall this Hotel needs major clean up"
"Dated and needs an update. Slow reception staff, understaffed at peak checkin and check out times. Had several issues with room door not working and key needed to be reprogrammed every time. And I did not keep key next to my phone or other RFID devices. 
Terrible breakfast and bad coffee. Location is in the city centre but there are lots of better hotels in the area. "
"While we did not have a bad experience with the hotel, it is still surprising that this is a 5 star hotel. The lobby is average, the elevator is old and slow, service is dependent on who is at the counter. Even the Mint Tea at the 16th floor bar is too overpriced. Location is not that good for tourists 

Good things about the hotel: the bed is large, breakfast food is ok, the transportation people and the bellhops were professional. Location maybe good for those in town for business.

Overall, hotel is OK but lower your expectations, it is not 5 stars by any stretch of the imagination."
"The hotel is horrible. The cleanliness in the room is very poor. My kid har white socks and after 10 minutes walking in the room its became black. Old furniture, smell of old in the room. The breakfast is always the same. The breakfast is until 10.30 in te morning. After 10.40. , in every morning, someone from the stuff said us we must leave the restaurant because they must prepare the lunch. In every morning after 10.00 we had to ask for water, for spoon, for glasses. Because its had missed and nobody bring others. 5 stars hotel."
"Very unpleasant surprise as this hotel clearly does not meet the Movenpick standards.
Where to start?
Room: very old style, tired bedside lighting appliances falling from the wall but kind of new carpet and new flat screen TV. 
Very poor selection of channels for a 5 star (no Canal+ which can be found in some 3 star hotels here) , no Bein sport either, mostly free channels!!!)
Decent wifi
Bathroom: vanity mirror barely staying fixed in the wall, threadbare old towels, , chipped tiles, not very clean (chewing gum on the floor and hair in bath)
Breakfast: very small room with max 50 seats for a 16 floor hotel! 
No SWISS MUESLI in a MOVENPICK: is this allowed by the Brand??? Only second grade cereals
When requesting a bowl for fruits, a staff took the last dirty bowl (with some crumbs inside) left in the breakfast room and without any shame, offered it to me!
Only the pastries bought from outside were excellent, the rest was so so.
The cook made me an omelet but with no attention to detail she left some egg shell inside!
Staff looks completely lost and were running everywhere like headless chicken 
Swimming pool: under repair - not available
Sauna & turkish bath: with the price of the room, i expected free access - nope got to pay extra
Gym: almost decent except for some broken equipment

Overall, Movenpick should do some unannounced visits here and either review the entire hotel thoroughly or take their brand to another hotel capable of delivering the Swiss standards instead of offering services barely reaching those of a 2-3 star "
"We were booked at The Kensi hotel but they did not honor our reservation due to the king visiting and sent us to the Movenpick Hotel , telling us it was a 5 star hotel. The hotel had a bad odor on our floor, smelt like sewage. The roof top restaurant and pool were nice but all of the tables were dirty, none had been cleaned after people left. We went to dinner at 7pm and were the only people there. We were a family of 4. We ordered soup for an appetizer and our meal. By 8:15, we had not received our soup yet. After complaining, we waited until 8:30 and left. Worst service we had ever seen.
This is not a 5 star hotel, it barely makes a 3 star. BEWARE"
"We stayed at this hotel movenpick for 2 nights 
Very disappointing 
Rooms odd shaped very noisy, one could hear the vehicles going up and down the street all night.
Breakfast was terrible.you have to ask for everything 
No way it is 5 star!
Dinner was great either."
"We had two nights in Casablanca before heading off for longer periods in Fes and Marrakech and having stayed at Mövenpick hotels in other parts of the world booked two junior suites at the Mövenpick Casablanca. Unfortunately this hotel is such a poor representation of the Mövenpick brand. It’s  decor is tired with chipped doors and stained carpets, the non smoking floors smell of smoke, the breakfast is average at best (and be prepared to eat yoghurt with a fork) and the room service and drinks way over-priced. Our junior suites on 14th floor were directly under the pool so all you hear is gurgling - it’s like sleeping inside a fish tank. But what is worse is that the staff are poorly trained, disinterested and often absent!  The doormen really can’t be bothered. The concierge needs to learn how to open his mouth, show his teeth and approximate a smile and the restaurant staff need to go on some kind of hospitality course. Maybe McDonalds? At least the cleaning staff are friendly. I would suggest that Mövenpick executives take a look at the Casablanca hotel and decide whether it really lives up to its corporate claim “Mövenpick Hotels & Resorts is one of the world’s most reputable upscale hotel management companies” - it’s a joke. Don’t think I’ll bother checking out that claim again. "
"What you would expect from a hotel is that you can sleep. They hosted us on the second floor when in a first there was a wedding party with percussion instruments and singers that ended 3am. Upon returning from the tour we returned to stay, asked to be allocated on a high floor, at breakfast we took a bowel infection that took us to the hospital on our return. I fainted 4 times on the flight. The facilities are good, but as they know we will not be back so early, they treat the tourist horribly."
"The roof top Bar ls very modern with good selections of spirits and food

The only remark i had is the service is very poor compare it by the same flagship movenpick in middle east like Dubai .

Need more training on customer service"
"The hotel services and description is not as advertised on expedia.
The hotel is situated on the main road, all far from the tourist areas of interest. 
The room standard is poor, although the description says iron, kettle, tv provided in the room, this is not true. The tv did not work, there was no kettle in the room although there were tea cups and tea bags, the minibar was completely empty, and there was no iron only the ironing board was provided. 
The ac did not work, the bathroom extractor did not work.
We repeatedly reported these areas to the reception, but nothing was done.
When we checked out the reception charged for full stay although we have already paid via expedia. We had to point out that we have already paid for the stay, they also asked if we had anything from the minibar, when I told them it was empty on pur arrival, they were sort of aware.

We do not reccommend this movinpick hotel poor standard."
"Visited Casablanca in May and stayed at the Movenpick for two nights. Location was  great and the size of rooms spacious. However, the images on the website don’t reflect the reality, hotel was clean but in if refurbishment, definitely overpriced ant not value for money. Good breakfast and roof top with pool offers spectacular views over the city. ❤️Casablanca "
"This hotel lacks the basics relating to proper hospitality management. They are ill equipped to deal with large groups and the food is of very low quality. The rooms were dirty on arrival, toiletries half used were strewn everywhere and the mini bars were raided. I would recommend you do not stay at this hotel."
"I don’t know how this place has scored those reviews. It’s a shame the movenpick group has put its name to this place. The reception and customer service and the standard of the rooms is just looks with no substance. I have stayed at Club Val de Anfa before and it is by far better than this poor place. I will never stay here please don’t be fooled by the Movenpick sign."
"One of the worst stays ever in any hotel. 
Movenpick Casablanca claims to be a 5 star. 
All doors are broken, water leaking from bathrooms, flooding bathrooms, stinking rooms, stinking passageways, horrible housekeeping, stern and rough reception, very rude and poor quality staff. 

This is the last and final time ever we have stayed in Movenpick. 

Our child got locked in the rooms since he doors had broken handles   After 30 minutes the housekeeping team came for rescue ! 

Reflection staff stopped attending to calls inspite of calling 20 tines. 

The duty manager was extremely bad and arrogant. When I said I shall complain they said DO WHAT YOU WANT ! 

This is very very bad for any hotel chain. "
"We are well travelled family of three and having been across four countries in the past 3 weeks we thought we would have a relaxing luxurious end to our travels before heading back to our Abu Dhabi home base. So we booked an executive suite at the Movenpick in Casablanca who advertised the usual extra benefits of spending the addition dollars on executive privileges. Sadly they did not deliver on the basics let alone the expectation of 5 star hotels.  
The issues:	
        1: Doorman was to busy smoking, to acknowledge us or even welcome us
	2: No functioning executive lounge (see photo’s)
	3: Minimal breakfast- one day we had an omelet chef, next day no omelet chef; no 
            bowls; no spoons; no coffee and tea offers…
	4: Room service- no answer on the phone for 50 minutes when we went to the front 
            desk to ask for our meal we got a discounted meal over an hour later
Need I go on, we have never stayed at Movenpick before and if this is the service expectation that are constant across all of their Hotels we will never again. For all the people that follow me on Trip Advisor please take note this was a very disappointing experience."
"I spent 2 nights in the Movenpick for business. Centrally located downtown, we were able to walk to our business meetings without experiencing the petit or grand taxi. Rooms were OK but need some remodeling and refurbishment, except for the bathroom. The problem as other hotels in the region is the level of service: a large number of waiters in the breakfast area discussing among themselves without really paying attention to client needs; a restaurant on the rooftop when you wait forever for the menu: mustard and mayonnaise never came. Obviously could do better ...."
"My husband and I booked the Movenpick for the last night of our honeymoon. We were looking forward to a relaxing evening before an early flight the next morning. After taking a cab from the train station, we arrived at the front desk where we were informed that the hotel was overbooked and our room was unavailable. Keep in mind that we had already booked and prepaid our stay THREE MONTHS in advance. The gentleman at the front desk was incredibly rude when I pushed back, even raising his voice at me. He then informed us that a Movenpick staffer would drive us “5 minutes” to a different hotel that would accommodate us. This was all after we had been traveling from Marrakech for several hours and were exhausted, and had already paid a cab to Movenpick. Well, after more like 20 minutes in a car, we arrived at the Farah Maghreb which was not only further from the airport than Movenpick (and poorer quality), but also had NO idea we were coming and informed us that the rate we had paid Movenpick was too low for them and they were unwilling to honor it.

All in all, we picked Movenpick for convenience. Instead, our time and energy were completely wasted. I’ve never been so poorly treated by a hotel or it’s staff. I understand hotels overbook, but simple courtesies such as an email ahead of time would have saved us a major headache. The worst part may have been that no one even apologized to us. If you value your time and your sanity, pick a different hotel. A terrible way to end our otherwise lovely honeymoon,"
"The most unpleasant staffs service out of all Morocco!

After a long trip. We checked in the hotel at 1.30 pm, the first in welcome greet from the staffs was""check in time at 3 pm! "" Not at least a comfort words to say maybe we will check and get back to you or anything. We sat and wait till spot on 3 pm.

Second..we asked for help from the concierge to get us a taxi to Quartier Habbous which is 7 mins by car. The guys talked to the taxi drivers in Arabic without knowing that we understand. We asked for help as we assumed the driver speaks French. Taxi driver told him 30 Durhams and the concierge guy say make it 50 Durhams and he can have 20 Durhams for himself.

Just before we leaving. We just asked at the horrible reception again if they have any small changes for us to exchange for the cab? They replied unwelcomely said that they're barely have enough for themselves.

Never again this hotel. You gave Morocco a bad name!
"
"We were in the hotel during Ramadan. The hotel had closed all three of their eating facilities to guests that we staying at the hotel. After complaining and venturing around the hotel for thirty minutes to find somewhere to eat.  We were forced to eat off an appetizer menu in the business center.When you are in a country where you don't speak the local language you stay at hotels and rely on their services because you might not want to venture out by yourself.  This was a total disgrace to the Movenpick brand name and I will never stay at another one in my life. "
"The hotel was fine itself but upon check in they told us we were upgraded free of charge and breakfast was now included. I had confirmed the breakfast was free since our original booking did not have that. The receptionist had reassured with the upgrade it was. Next morning we have breakfast (definitely not even worth it) and they charge us 400 and tell us we were making it up. Reading previous reviews it seems like they scam people all the time with the free breaskfast and then end up charging everyone. Biggest scammers in casablanca. Choose another hotel as this one scams you and you can’t even feel safe."
"We’ve spend a night booked by our agent which included a meal and a  breakfast. To our disappointment we found out that the groups were placed at the old rooms , not the renovated ones.  Our room no:302 was quite spacious though with lots of amenities but the materials are old and tired. The biggest shenanigan was kept in the breakfast. Although we were informed that all meals are taking place at a large hall in the ground floor,  next morning we were guided to the first floor, where the so call breakfast buffet was offered far less products and quality than the one in the ground floor. There wasn’t even honey or scrambled eggs a bare necessity even in a two star hotels. So be aware group travelers, choose carefully or deal better with your agent. "
"It’s not 5 star and the rooms are dark and in need of updating. The ONLY positive is the SMALL rooftop pool and bar. Stay elsewhere. There is also a sewage smell in the rooms and halls. It’s covered with fragrance in the public areas. "
"hotel is located in the central business district-you will need a car or cab to get places. expensive by morocco standards. the room was noisy and stuffy. the toilet was unflushed when we arrived and stank. front desk staff were pleasant. breakfast was overpriced. 
I am sure there are better choices."
"The hotel gave us an ineffective room key. We went back to the reception to check and finally could go in; however, the room they gave us had already occupied with someone else, we could see the ocuppant's luggage and belongings. We went back to the reception and asked for someone to accompany us to check. The hotel refused. Bad experience."
"This hotel would be OK if it was advertised as a high 3* or a low 4* but to call it 5* is delusional.  The worst issue is the breakfast.  A poor choice, badly cooked and lukewarm. I arrived as a large Chinese tour group had fully depleted the limited breakfast buffet and the staff were unable to replenish it promptly. There was virtually no food, no coffee, no milk, no plates, etc.  If the buffet had been of suitable 5* quality to begin with, the tour group could have been easily accommodated without leading to problems for other guests.  But the buffet is so far below expectations, there is no way it could cope.  The management here need to visit other 5* hotels in the region to find out how it should be done.

I notice the manager responded to a previous complaint with a mouthwatering description of the buffet.  Ignore his description.  It is just gush and completely oversells what they have to offer.

Rooms are adequate at 4* level. Wifi and hot water are good.  But that alone does not make a 5* hotel.

Looking forward to reading the manager’s overblown and unrealistic response to this.

My first, and last, time visiting a Movenpick Hotel."
"This Hotel does not have a enough parking space in the front and it is located on a busy street corner. I was traveling with a group, and we were ready to board our bus heading for the airport but we could not do it because  there was another bus parked on the only space available, the driver did not want to move his bus, no matter what. We were outside for 45 minutes while the two bus drivers were arguing,  Finally We have to move out all of our suitcases out to the street and wait outside in the middle of a very cold morning for our bus, we even have to argued with the police so we could board our bus, it was a very bizarre situation, The manager of the Hotel did want to help us, He could request the driver of the other bus to move it out  since it was on the Hotel property, but nobody over there help us, we could not believe the Hotel indifference to our situation."
"Dirt everywhere. Our bathroom was broken and dirty. Poor buffet and breakfast with bad food quality.  Not friendly stuff. This is not even 2* hotel. Very expensive and nothing to offer. Never ever again"
"Not as expected for a 5 stars hotel as our room was locked and poor efforts were made to compensate. The design is very old and several equipments did not work properly: safe, missing iron and broken mirror. Never again."
"POSITIVES:
- WiFi was strong and did not need any password
- Good location
- Room and reception smelt lush with aromatic fragrance, beds and pillows were super comfy and was spotlessly clean

NEGATIVES:
- Concierge was rude and kept on hard selling his ""taxi friends"" to use their taxi leaving us with ""no choice"". Also the concierge failed to inform the taxi driver on the right location (we were supposed to go to Basmane restaurant which the concierge booked for us that day, but told the taxi driver to Le Petite Rocher restaurant instead) so we ended up at the wrong restaurant 
- Hotel had a money exchange service at reception. However they did not even have sufficient money to exchange our money from Pounds Sterling to Moroccan Dirhams, and said the smallest change they had to provide me was only 50 dirhams bank note (not even any coins!)
- I informed the hotel it was my birthday on arrival so they said they will prepare me a birthday cake on arrival. When I checked in, they asked if I already received it, I said no because I only arrived to check in - how was I supposed to know if the cake arrived in the room? Went to my room and no birthday cake was there. I had to even CALL reception to ask for this, and they said they will look into it. The birthday cake only arrived after I left for dinner.
- Not enough plugs in the room to charge electronic devices, only in the main table. There are no plugs next to the bed which makes it annoying as we have to unplug the water bottle and lamps to be able to charge our devices.
- No porter service to deliver your suitcase up to your room after checking in. We had to do this ourselves.

Definitely not a 5* hotel service for the price we had to pay, no breakfast was included. Staff needs proper training for this hotel chain in Casablanca, Morocco."
"Nearly impossible to pull in or make use of the valet. The portico in front of the hotel fits precisely two cars. Hotel is dated, dark and dank. If that weren't bad enough, it is ridiculously overpriced for what it is; and we purportedly got a corporate rate. Stay clear."
"Very bad Room Service and Food Quality. All of us got sick next day. Even kids could not eat the food that was served. One it was late, second it was smelling and stale. You all cannot even make a Pizza right - our groups order was easily more than 2000 MAD - so significant - almost all of it was discarded and thrown away. "
"Let's start by saying if you were thinking about staying here, PLEASE think again.

I don't think it's much to expect a double occupancy room to have a bathroom door that I can close without having to wrestle with. It would also be nice to have two bathrobes and not one.

Breakfast looks quite nice on the face of it. However, once we sat there was nothing nice about it. Fried eggs were burnt from one side and raw from the other (definitely not what i asked for), pastry was from the night before at best. Had to share salt and pepper with one other table because there wasn't any more of that. Asked for a spoon the moment I sat down and did not get one at all..

Below par service appears to be a theme at the hotel. I asked for an electricity adapted several times (each time being told it's coming shortly) and did not get one for the whole of my 2 night's stay. 

The only positive about the Movenpick Casablanca is that the rooms were of a decent size.

Location isn't that good either. There are better places to stay if you want to be close the old Medina and even better places to stay if you want to be near the more modern side of town.

Safe to say I'm not going to step foot in that hotel again!"
"Avoid this hotel, not well kept, not well equipped to checkin, very sorry rooms.
Sink and shower drained trickling down. 
Hornets mud nest on top of the bed on the ceiling on the fire alarm. 
Painfully slow and chaotic checkin. "
"Not recommended for any type of stay..

The hotel is in a very busy and noisy cross road.

Pros: friendly staff, beds were clean and AC worked.

Cons: it took 15-20 min to check in which caused chaotic situation with some people with local guides trying to cut in;
Sink and bath tub drained very slowly (10 & 20 min). Hotel claims to offer airport shuttle but told us to take a cab; discovered a hornets nest on top of the bed in the morning!!!!"
"We had a confirmed booking in this hotel and had got it reconfirmed in the afternoon. At the time of checking in the front desk told us , after taking copies of our passport and other details, that for some technical reason they are not able to check us in and that they are moving us to a different hotel. I don't think there was any technical difficulties for they did check in 2 other guests. I think they were overbooked. 
Looks like we were not the first to experience this. I just saw another review in Expedia who had the same experience. Front desk staff was very indifferent and were not even sorry for the inconvenience caused. The hotel that they moved us into was ok. At the time of checking in the front desk in the new hotel asked for our credit card for room rent. When we told her that it had been already paid for she said that they have not received the payment. It took us sometime to sort out the issue and check in. "
"I and my family have booked this hotel via a travel club. We have 60 rooms total. Our group of 17 pax with 9 rooms are arrived first at 1 pm. I have asked for 3 couple near by rooms (2 rooms near by each other for 3 families). The receptionist said the hotel is fully booked. We went out for lunch and we're back at 3 pm. They asked us to wait until 4 pm, we got the room key which shocked me.
The service in this hotel is very bad when I have asked for anything house keeping, never come?
Today I have asked 3 hot water in the bowls, I need to ask from 3 different waiters. And took more than 10 min. Last waiter just gave 3 empty bowls with rough action which made bowls drop from the bar.
When our tour leader talked to the last waiter, he said too many guests.
I told him that it is not an excuse, if he or they do not want to do the service job, they should stay home, should not come to work.
I feel unhappy to stay here in Movenpick and would like to share my bad experience to all TripAdvisor members."
"The overall service was so poor I wouldn’t stop here if I was homeless. The staff approach was negative, poor communication and staff were rude and argumentative on reception. The breakfast was appalling, lack of choice, staff were half asleep. If your desperate give this hotel a go. This is not what you expect. This hotel group in other countries is great. Local staff mentally around customer service centres on rudeness. "
"We booked this hotel for our first night in Morocco, but instead, the front desk  told us that the hotel was oversold and he had to place us at another hotel nearby.  We refused but there was nothing he could do since we were the last to arrive.  It was an extremely long day for us coming all the way from NY.  We did not understand why he had to take our passport if the hotel was oversold.  We booked this room very early so we had a good rate and I think they thought the price was low, so he rathered put us in another hotel that he can make more in their own instead.  He later offered us free breakfast and transportation back to their hotel. Even though we did not really want that, but that was the best they could do.  We left unwillingly and were forced to stay in a so called five star hotel named Hotel D'anfa.  The hotel did not meet five star in any way at all.  While we were checking in, the front desk asked us to pay a hotel tax so I took out my credit card but he said it was too little to charge.  He claimed they had a 100 dirham minumum for credit card usage. I thought it was ridiculous, especially for a five star hotel. Really?!!  I told him I did not have dirham or euro so he just grabbed my card and swiped.  The carpet in front of the elevator looked like it was picked up from the street somewhere.  The room was quite big and it was not carpeted, which was the only good thing about the hotel. However the bathtub was clogged and my husband could not take a shower because of that.  We didn't believe Movenpick was sold out, so my husband called and asked and we were right. They had rooms, but they just wanted to rent it out for more! It was a total disgrace for this European luxury hotel chain!!"
"I apologise for the lack of syntax in the review below as I've written it just after it occured! Believe it or not, I have a degree in English!

After an 8.5hr drive from Ait Ben Haddou, we arrived at the Movenpick Hotel at 745pm to check in, just in time for our 8pm hammam & massage.

The check in guy, Ahmed took our passports and returned them with the news that our booking had been changed and they would be moving us to another hotel. 

First of all, I was dumb founded as to how this happened. Ahmed, glibly told me that they had a technical problem, I said, What do you mean technical? He repeated, we have a technical problem! Uh? He certainly missed the training session on customer recovery and stared at me with a glib smirk!

I asked to speak to the manager and was told that there was no manager working tonight and so another guy called Mourad stood in front of me. I say 'stood' beacause he looked at me as if I had the problem. Not even a hint of... How can I help sir?

I asked the same question about the technical problem and he said, that they had had a water leak. I thought, fair enough!

I asked if we could have a spa treatment at the other hotel, he said yes, but not a hammam, but you can have the hammam here. So I said, let me get this clear, you're telling me after an 8.5hr drive, I can have a hammam here, go to the other hotel, have a massage and check in to the other hotel.. I was starting to get confused and angry now.

As a courtesy for this inconvenience, I asked if there would be any compensation. He offered a complimentary hammam, right now in the hotel.

I looked at my partner and said, am I missing something here? So we have a hammam here, get in a car, go to another hotel... wait, wait, the idea of the hammam & massage is to relax, then sleep and wake up fresh and fly for 30hrs back to Sydney. 

I said, come on Mourad, that doesn't sound very relaxing. He then offered me a complimentary dinner at the Movenpick, I didn't feel like eating , I felt sick to my stomach. I was speechless as I was trying to visualise eating dinner in my 8.5hr driving clothes, then being taxied to another hotel.

At this point, there was another couple about to check in, so I asked them in an extra loud voice, if there room had been cancelled too, they said I hope not, did you book on booking.com? I said yes and joked about the fact that their room could be cancelled too and that the service recovery was terrible.

As soon as I made a more public display, the energy/feeling behind the check in desk changed and something was muttered in another language and miraculously, as if by magic, they found a room for us! 

Are you for real? Out of thin air they find a room. How does this happen?

Ahmed returns with some list, in all truth, I don't care about the list. 

Now I feel that I am being lied to, so first there's no room, now there's a room. There's a technical problem, there's a leak..Ahhh! Christ almighty, this is painful! 

The customer service was awful, D grade.. even to the point where I tried to copy Ahmed's smirk and he laughed out loud in my face. I wish I had recorded it on my iPhone as it was so unbelievable!

So we get the keys and I asked if we could have the complimentary meal that had been offered, to which Mourad said, you have the room! BLANK EXPRESSION!

I should have realised that this was not going to be the best hotel experience from the fact that I had to send two emails enquiring about the spa menu. I wanted to spend up and have the most luxurious treatment available! I finally, received communications from Salha El Mouhader, Spa Manager! Judging from the level of communication at check in I'm really pleased that we didn't have the treatment that was booked. I'm sure it would've been sub standard as reflected by the check in staff.

It's hilarious, beacause I'm sure the General Manager, Amr Kallini will come up with some smug reply after this review! I don't care!

This has been the worst experience of our month away in Italy and Morocco. 

This should have been a beautiful last night in Morocco as my partner and  I have been celebrating our 10th anniversary, instead it was just awful. Do yourself a favour and book somewhere else or trust in magic and you might get a room! Insha'Allah"
"Take care with your belongings, you can't leave it alone not even for one hour in the room (sunglass disappeared after staff cleaned the room when my father was taking his breakfest). Really sad to have such experience!"
"International Name
Ugly Lobby
Ugly Rooms
Ugly Facilities
The furniture is super Old.
Nothing nice in the Hotel except for it's Swiss name.
I'm sure I'm not the only one to write negatively about them."
"Customer or guest should be the priority to be served. Commitment of the Hotel to its guests must be honored and fairly executed. Value of service must be considered first all the time than value of money or worst at the expense of the guest."
" i used to travel a lot to casablanca for buisiness ,  it is my second time in this hotel  , i find worst than first time  , i 'm really disapointed  with cleaning service , breakfest and some waiters unprofesionality , definetly never i will choose again .
1  during first day , i find long black hairs on the bathroom floors , tthey were there during all may staying  despite of room cleaning 2 times !!
2 toilets at reception and restaurant are really dirty !! 
3 i had bad feeling and gastrointeritis after sandwich eating , was ordered at bar near swiming pool on top of hotel.
 4  some waiters are not really profesional .
 5 Staff overdone and noisy during breakfast 
"
"Escape and never book in this hotel. They don't have a health care service. The pool and towels are very dirty and not cleaned daily. In a little pool increadible loud music. The front office manager Mourad El Meliani doesn't respond to client request. Cannot keep calm, just show off and no solution. No any respect to foreigners. They don't treat foreigners as it should be. Very low english level. They never understand what you want to say. They should hire a front office manager who speaks clearly english at least. "
"Terrible service, disgusting breakfast, inefficient front desk...avoid this hotel that would hardly deserve a 3 star rating.
Too much to improve on. All the staff has to be grateful to have a job instead of being sulky and rude "
"Like the other negative reviews state, as soon as an issue arose, the staff became unpleasant and only had their best interest in mind.

We were told at checkin that breakfast was free, but after breakfast, we got a bill for 66 Euro (other breakfasts in Morocco cost us less than 10 euro). We explained/argued our case to 4 different employees (over two hours of our vacation gone), but every reply was essentially ""We never said breakfast was free, it is your fault for thinking it was free"".  

To avoid this issue, we should not have trusted the hotel's word, because they denied it, and we didn't have proof. We should have gotten the statement in writing, or checked it against the email we received from the time of booking that breakfast wasn’t included. At hotels that charge this much, normally you can rest assured that you won't need proof of every verbal interaction.  

In addition, the room had some issues (shower-head wouldn't stay up, soap holder was rotted out of the wall, etc). These things didn't really affect our stay, but we could've paid less for rooms of that quality."
"rooms are very noisy, i had to change rooms two times. Breakfast is not that good, they had flies on the cheese. Very poor quality, also please do not ask for coffee since it really has a bad taste. The staff was ok with my complaints and they managed to give me a quiet room in the end. Overall it was an unpleasant stay. I would not stay here again. The only good thing is that it has a good location. "
"This hotel lookes nice and organised, but isn't worth the money.
The staff is untrained and unskilled and and some are even rude and ignorere you as a guest.
They do not live up to the standard at which the hotel appears to be."
"This was my first stay at a Movenpick hotel. I thought it was a standard 4 star business hotel, but instead it turned out to be a 3 star tourist hotel for discounted tour groups staying one, maybe two nights most.  Nothing wrong with these hotels, sometimes people travel in large groups.  I don't.  The service matches the hotel's type. We arrived early for an extended stay of 6 nights. Most hotels are happy to have that type of client, but not here. Since we were staying for so long, we reserved and prepaid for an upgraded deluxe room to have the extra space. When we got up to the room it a standard. Not a good way to start. I complained, they said it was a deluxe room, I said it wasn't (if you want to deceive your guests, stop putting pictures up on your website of the different types of rooms.) I complained again, then they said they had nothing available and would have to move me tomorrow. Hey guys, just tell me the truth. work with me, and find a way to accommodate me - comp my room for me the first night, invite me to dinner, apologies for not having what I reserved - just don't lie to me. What choice did I have, I said okay and we went out to meet some friends and family. When we got back, I sat on the bed, it was broken, completely broken. Bad sign, I called down to the front desk and they all the sudden were able to move me into the room I originally booked. Decent room in size, but things didn't improve. The room was noisy - we heard the tv through the wall form the room next door, and very early noises from the service hall on the other side of the room.  The bed, hard to pinpoint it, just not comfortable. Pillows also, same story. They belonged on a sofa, not a bed.  The room was clean, however the maid never refreshed the coffee/tea station and I had to call down for supplies every day. You think after the first, they would get it.  Same story with the soap. Two people and one tiny soap for a week! As far as the breakfast, pathetic. Mediocre limited selection. Staff was nice. They do have a pool on the roof, which is nice. It's small with limited seating and can get crowded when the bus tours get back from their sightseeing. Only thing, they don't have everything on the menu and can't even make a milkshake - what, you can't get blenders in Casablanca, I think you can. Crowing glory - On checkout, they tried to charge me for a minibar item I never used. No one has tried to pull me on this one in a very long time. I will check my bill at home."
"When we checked in we asked what the dining options were , and were advised that there were 3 restaurants, but that the sushi bar was unavailable that night due to a private function. So we asked the front desk to cancel our reservation at a restaurant outside the hotel. 
But when we came to dine we found that in fact all 3 restaurants were closed to private functions, so we were stuck in a lounge area and offered a menu with 10 simple dishes. 
OK, but then when we ordered most of the dishes were unavailable. The staff did not have a clue what they were doing, and when the food eventually arrived after more than 1 hour it was not what we ordered, but we ate it just so we could leave. And the wine that we had waited for so patiently arrived just as we finished eating ..
Whatever you do avoid this place. Ramadan is no excuse for closing all your restaurants to private functions. They have no consideration for their staying guests"
"Incredible that, for all the luxury hotels in Marrakech, there is not a single top quality hotel in the commercial capital. The Sofitel is probably the best followed by the Hyatt and Movenpick.

This Movenpick falls way short of what might be expected of the brand. True, public spaces have been upgraded to a more contemporary style. Bathroom fixtures in the bedrooms have been improved (but no walk-in shower, still a tub). However, it looks like the old carpets and furniture in the bedrooms have been retained, the level of cleanliness is not what it should be and sloppy paint work is widely evident.

The rooftop pool is much smaller than it appears in the photos. When I visited the rooftop cafe for a lunch  snack, the pool was dominated by five or six big guys who didn't seem to be hotel guests but probably friends of the manager.

My lunch order took 35 minutes to deliver even though there was no one else in the cafe. Even then, they got the order wrong. In fairness, when I complained, the manager waived the food charge on my bill. And the food was fine.

There is a band playing poolside in the evening. Choose a lower floor if you don't want to be disturbed.

A bellman knocked on my door at 10:30pm claiming wrongly that I had requested baggage service to check out. And so on, and so on....

If there is such a thing as Movenpick quality control, they need to send a swat team in to sort this place out."
"We scheduled transportation to the airport through the front desk of hotel the day before our departure.  The pickup time of (3:00am) and price were confirmed and agreed upon up front.  The hotel staff introduced us to the driver the day before which was nice.  The hotel also gave the driver a written note with the pickup time and agreed upon price - which was all great.

On the morning of the pickup the driver loaded our bags in the car and then stated that there was a problem that he needed to speak privately about.  The driver needed to increase the price to the airport by 40% due to the time of the day.

This would be a different type of situation if  the driver would not have been recommended by the hotel.  But since the driver was recommended, took our bags, and then needed to renegotiate the originally agreed upon price seemed distasteful.  In summary the transportation issue seemed shady. 

Besides the transportation issue, the hotel was acceptable for the location and price.

"
"I arrived at the hotel with a confirmed reservation and I was told that some other guests decided to extend their stay and I have to go to another hotel!!!

So Even if you have a reservation, you might not get a room !!!"
"Dear All 

Pls take care because Movenpick Caablanca sold my booked room without any prior notice to myself and they booked a cheaper hotel (and not the same level) for myself which was an unacceptable act for me. Furthermore I was not the only one suffering from it and I discovered that there was sseveral clients discussing for same issue with the reception. It was unbelievable, I propose to avoid booking from this hotel in order to not have a catastrophic situation and finding you without a room in the evening time"
"I am talking only about the restaurant in the lobby floor where I had breakfast. The rate was 280 MAD. According to my experience with the food, it is not worth the money.In Insense in Kenzi hotel, you pay 200 and the food and service is better? "
"The location is very bad, the front desk personal was very rude, the internet was not available during the stay, even when it came back it was not working .
The restaurant personal was no help at all to figure out their menu.
Overall, never ever again.
"
"Actually I am totally not satisfied with the case happened as well as the management reaction regarding the problem I faced during my stay at the hotel which is experienced successfully in lot of other hotels "
"We pay more than the bill which we booked in hotels.com.it was the first time that i have faced it.all our request was rejected by receptionest.they didn't pay attention to guests at all.the breakfast was good.it is not worthy to pay and stay."
"the elevator is suddenly stopped, guest has to walk from 16 floor to 2 floor.
when guest check out, reception couldn't recognize guest was checked in and charge guest as no show.
check out guest paid in cash, and meanwhile credit card was charged again. double charge.
service from reception is very poor.  "
"Bad service, no one answers the phones. In consistent messages when it comes to opening a second room. 

Breakfast is terrible. 

Staff are always busy talking or sleeping instead of helping the clients . "
"I did not get the doble room with doble bed I had booked and paid for and with 1.85 cms and 1.95 cms height one of us ended up sleeping on a supplementary bed with no adjustment whatsoever to the rate of the reservation we had paid for."
"It was my first experience in Morocco and I would appreciate to have a better one! 
I would recommend to the management to change the ""Moroccan"" client  experience approach, which is - announcing prices to the clients, when the service is already delivered, meaning that client has no other way, than to pay. 

No amenities announced when checking-in, even if we thought that breakfast was included in our reservation, appeared that we didn't have it, but nobody informed us, we learned about it, when waitress asked us to sign a bill, during the breakfast with equivalent of 52€ for two person, (sorry guys we are not in Paris George V hotel!!!) 

Wi-Fi was cut 3 hours in advance before  the check-out and has never been restored, even if promised.... 

If you try to take stairways from 1st floor towards the 00 one, it smell the rotten garbage.... 

When checking out reception asking to pay for mini bar items which were not consumed, but I said they were making mistake - nobody apologized, the contrary - they were not happy ...... 

Not mentioning that, pillows are like stuffed water bubbles, not adjustable at all, mattresses not comfortable, you hear noise of neighbors all night long, if you have a wish to have a breath, you need to go on the roof floor or out of the hotel, all the rest is closed and oxygen less. 

If you have a wish to have a very horrible stay in Casa, you can make a reservation  ✌🏽️I will never go back, thanks for experience...."
"After doing reservation directly with website of hotel during my business trip I was forced to cut my staying from 4 nights down to 3 however they charged for all the nights of my reservation despite I informed about it at check in time. They are charging one extra night but losing a customer for ever."
"Safe should work
Shoes cleaning service should work (as is written in the wardrobe)
Bath tube should not be blocked up
Room should have a hair dryer (if not installed to the wall, at least a remote one)
Room should be similar to the one on the picture (booking.com)
For that price in 5 star hotel I feel I should get 1 bottle of water out of charge each day
Would be nice if concierge has umbrellas for hotels guests in case of rain (as you have in Movenpick in Istanbul)."
"Ask for a upper floor or have good earplugs !
Check out is complicated, even if you speak French
Breakfast is average (do not ask for scrambled eggs)
in conclusion, it does not worth the price you will pay."
"We were two couples traveling and we paid for both rooms.  Knowing that Movenpick is an excellent hotel brand throughout the Middle East, I had very high expectations.  My first and last impression of the hotel staff is that they're trying their best.  However, the hotel itself seems a bit outdated.  We were looking forward to the rooftop pool that turned out to be quite small.  Nevertheless, we tried to enjoy a meal at the restaurant, which turned out to be a very expensive endeavor.  We were provided no menus whatsoever so we had no clue what the prices were for anything.  The meal was so large that we should have shared it.  In the end, we asked to have it packed.  The staff was VERY hesitant to do this.  For the prices we were paying, I would expect Heaven and Earth to move!  The spa services were also equally unimpressive.  Nice girl, but boring massage.  The room was clean, spacious, and comfortable.  The front desk staff was extremely helpful and friendly.  However, we were led astray when we tried to arrange a taxi to get my husband to the airport.  We were told so much and split the  the difference with the doorman as a tip.  When my husband arrived at the airport, the driver was arguing with him about the amount of money insisting that he pay more.  My husband ultimately paid him additionally in dollars and had to threaten the police if the driver kept harassing him.  A HUGE disappointment!  I do blame the hotel for this, as the whole reason for choosing a 5-star hotel is for a 5-star experience all the way around.  We needed an airport shuttle and this just didn't work.  "
"Great room, felt misled by staff. 30 Euros for a cup of coffee a pastry and some fruit for breakfast. Sorry but that's egregious.  Food at the restaurant was sub-par and service wasn't great. I am sure that there is better value elsewhere in Casablanca"
"The hotel is right on the road and its too noisy...breakfast was also ok. The return transport provided by the hotel to the Airport was one of the worst car I have traveled in recent times...1980's model with smelly seats and broken here & there although they charged normally (. I won't stay here again for sure. "
"I have stayed at previous Movenpick Hotels and this one in Casablanca was the worst hotel experience I have had. From the moment of check-in, the queues were long and there were only two check-in staff members that were at the front desk. I had to remind the staff member that a security deposit was already taken from my account and was very surprised that he was not aware of this. They ended up taking 2 security deposits from my account as their machines were not working and I am now awaiting for these funds to be cancelled from their end with an email they were due to send me as confirmation that I still have not received.
The room they provided me lacked cleanliness and had a horrible sewage smell. I reported this and it took them 45 minutes to have someone come to my room ""to check"" and could not apparently smell the scent even though when I queried this over the phone, the operator told me that this was just an isolated situation in that room. Why provide me with this room in the first place?
The room I was moved to, was again not in the best state but by that stage, following an 8 hour flight, I was very tired to go through the same process again.
Room service came back cold and staff member was scoffing at the fact that I was not happy which I think is completely unprofessional.
I also had my earphones that went missing in my room."
"Besides the fact that the rooms are very tired to say the least, and do not reflect 5 star qualify, I had 2 very unpleasant experiences at this hotel :

1- At my arrival I went to the rooftop pool straight away, since it was one of the reasons I picked this hotel over the sofitel or fourseasons. At my arrival to the pool I asked the bar tender ""soukaina"" for the menu so that I can order some drinks. She did bring the menu and last minute decided not to serve me because it was ""eid"" and that it was forbidden to serve moroccan guests, I showed my US passport and I assured her that I am not muslim, but she would still refuse to serve me and went on a personal conversation about my faith and my name that sounds ""moroccan"" or ""muslim"" , she was serving other customers which felt very discriminatory to me, she advised me to go to my room if I wanted to have a drink, which was absolutely ridiculous. I went down to the minibar and grabbed a drink, took it with me to the pool, only to have her manager ""mourad"" come and ask me not to show the beer as if I was doing something horribly wrong. I could hear both of them having a conversation about me . After a couple of hours, once soukaina was gone, another very pleasant and experienced server told me that it was absolutely fine to have a drink since I am a US citizen and served me the entire afternoon. This is absolutely ridiculous and unacceptable, I am a world traveler and work at the corporate headquarters of one of the largest hotel companies in the world. I respect the laws of the countries I visit, but I do believe that this was more of a personal thing than following the rules. There is a much better way to do this without making the customer feel like they were discriminated against.
2- Breakfast was mediocre, I hadnt realized that I needed to pay extra for breakfast and when I was handed the bill, which I was willing to pay, the attendant was rude and demanded that I sign right away which I did. One server later told me to go to the front desk and adjust the reservation to include breakfast to avoid a large fee which I did, but she had already posted the charge, Nabila at the front desk was pleasant and able to fix it.

The second incident can happen anywhere, but the first one was absolutely outrageous and I am expecting a a logical explanation from the hotel.

One positive note : the Housekeeping attendant at the pool and the valet person who parked our car were very pleasant and professional."
"The stay was with family for vacation in Morocco. I would say I was NOT impressed at all on the service. This is just typical hospitality (or lack thereof)  you would expect from Moroccan. 

The room size was small and the room was marginally clean and prepared. 

Breakfast was very minimal, very long wait time for ordering anything (espresso, omelet, etc) and the taste was very plain, given the general Moroccan cuisine are rich on spice. 

Definitely won't stay again in the future"
"Awful hotel, from staff to cleanliness, passing by food and amenities. You don't get for the value of your money (rooms are very small, towels are so dirty that they are grey, breakfast is very poor and you still pay 25€ for it...). The wifi is not working well in the rooms, you book a king size bed and you get 2 tiny beds... No early check-in if you arrive early morning and you have to pay a full day charge ...
This hotel doesn't deserve more than 2 stars! Some staff members (the receptionist Abdelmadjid and his manager Mourad) are very rude, unprofessional and do not care about customer satisfaction . I will never book ever again in this hotel..."
"Location is good, but I was very disappointed, this movenpick doesn't have the standards from other movenpick hotels. Air conditioning problems in the hotel, very bad smell, room not clean. Check in very long, only one receptionist, was waiting 20mn everytime going to reception. Breakfast was fine, but not enough staff to serve ppl, dirty and again bad smell."
"We are a family of 3 and staying for 1 night to transit back home .The room is modern and the bed is comfortable , with complimentary water. Everything is fine until we realise its not ready for 3 people ( adults ) There is only 1 king bed and a sofa( not sofa bed) , two cups and 2 sets of towels, and 1 pair of slippers .Obviously it's not ready for us to check in , so I called reception for all these issues and he brushes me off and said okay I will bring everything up . So we left the hotel expecting it should be fixed by the time we come back . Later that night it was still the same and I have called the reception 3-4 times and none of these calls got through. Another odd thing was that at around 10 pm 1 room cleaner open the door as if she is checking on something . Having random staff opening ur door at night !?? 
Service from the front desk can be better as two staffs don't seems to be friendly and patient .
Overall , service is below average and wouldn't come back again."
"We arrived at 11.30pm after travelling for 5 hours. There was one staff member at reception, Ahemd was his name; who proceeded to tell me that the hotel was actually fully booked and so they did not have a room for us even though I had received a confirmation email from the hotel 3 days prior and they had taken the money out of my account the morning of our arrival - something which they later denied; thank god for online banking is all I'll say. He then told us that there was a room available in another hotel not too far from where we were. However, he would not tell us the name or the address of this other hotel; at this point, I asked for the manager. We were told he would be 5 minutes. The manager arrived 35 minutes later; which meant it was now 12.45am. The manager apologisedand decided to check their system again to see if there was a mistake. There was not. He then told us that they're might be a room available on the seventh floor and proceeded to bring us up there; he then went into this room to find a client and their children asleep and acted as if it was not a big deal that he had just gone in to an occupied room while the customers slept. We went back down to reception and he had the audacity to ask why I was unhappy. Keeping in mind they hadn't even offered us a drink of water at this point. He then insisted he show me a list of the 10 other rooms in the same position as us as an attempt to make us feel better? At 1.30am, a ""taxi"" finally arrived to bring us to this other hotel which the manager of movenpick assured us would be an upgraded version of the room we had booked; alas another disappointment as the room was a complete downgrade. We went outside to the so called taxi to find the man from reception who was no older than 25 sitting behind the wheel. We got in to the car and waited for 10 minutes while he tried to figure out how to take the car out of park. We drove in complete silence to the second hotel where the receptionist followed us inside and told us that we would have to pay. I laughed in his face. Once I said that I would not be paying this second hotel as movenpick had already taken the money out of my account, he rang the manager in the first hotel who called me an idiot and shouted at me through the phone. We went back and forth for about 20 minutes. He then told me to wait in reception while he sent someone over for me to sign something. I asked if we could leave it until the morning as it was now 2.45am and all I wanted to do was sleep. He agreed and said that movenpick was our hotel and that the following day we could get a taxi back to have breakfast and use their facilities. We finally went up to the room and we're getting ready for bed when there was a knock on the door; it was some man from reception in movenpick who wanted me to sign a preauthorisation for a payment; which I refused to sign as the money had already taken out. We were then invited back down to reception to speak to the movenpick manager who again insulted me. I was so fed up at this point; I hung up the phone and stormed back to our room as it was now 3.30am and breakfast was ending at 10 the following morning. 

After an awful nights sleep, we checked out of the second hotel and were forced to pay local tax which i wasn't happy about as in every other hotel we had stayed in, the taxes were all included in the price. 

We arrived back in movenpick to be greeted by the manager from the night before who said ""excuse me miss but you still have to pay me."" 

I ignored, and went for breakfast. The staff were honestly appalling, we asked for orange juice which the waiter forgot about on two occasions; so I asked an elderly lady 25 minutes after we first asked who then told me that breakfast was closed and so it would not be possible; even though they were bending over backwards serving another table of business men. 

We then went up to the pool to reserve some seats before dealing with the manager. Thankfully the night manager had gone home and we dealt with the front desk manager who was the first friendly face we had come across. I have to give credit where credit is due, he was so professional, apologetic and sweet and seemed genuinely shocked at what I was telling him. He asked the problem and listened to everything I had to say and did not cut across me once; he was appalled and apologised over and over again. He explained everything a lot better than the other two we had dealt with. He brought us up to the pool and ensured us to get whatever we wanted free of charge. 

Overall, the hotel itself may have appeared as a five star but the staff did certainly not meet this standard. We dealt with about 12 of their staff and the only one who was not completely incompetent was the front desk manager. He insured me that if we ever came back to Casablanca we would be upgraded free of charge but to be honest, I don't think I would ever step back into the movenpick hotel. It was an absolute disaster. "
"I spent two nights in the hotel for business and while the room was quite clean, the washroom was not, as the toilette showed signs of pee spots on the floor from previous guests. This is unacceptable as the housecleaning must include washing the floor of the toilette every day. I don't compromise for hygiene. And the second day it was the same which means that housekeeping staff wasn't simply having this duty in their check list.
The first day only I found complimentary water, not the second day: another disappointment.
The restaurant where I had breakfast was without AC or anyway AC was not properly working. In the corridors and in the whole hotel there was an annoying stink of dirt. 
From business perspective, the wifi is very terrible, so it's quite difficult to work and definitely I would recommend business travelers not to select this hotel: last time I was in Casablanca, I stayed at Hyatt which is much better and I would definitely go back there. This time I opted for Movenpick because in all other countries in MEA where I have been in Movenpick the experience was satisfactory. I regret my choice this time. The overall assessment is: VERY POOR !"
"No wifi in a business hotel. Lobby staff are not equipped to handle business travellers. Service was very low standard. 
Breakfast was okay. The service in their Skybar was extremely slow. A business guest I was entering waited 35 minutes for a drink. "
"

Stayed in this hotel for 3 nights n the horrible experience started from day 1. The staff named Jalila (or Julila I forgot exactly but I have her photo if you want) has bad attitude towards guests with no smile and unhappy working attitude. Rooms booked through booking.com was said to be not found in the system and she asked us to call booking.com by ourselves. She was holding our passports and asked us to wait. She couldn't solve the problem and asked us to look for a solution and stay somewhere else! What a suggestion, yeah? But it's true. The front desk manager only works until 5:30-6pm, so if you have any problem after that hour, you can only talk to staff like Julila and her colleague Fatima (who is also as unfriendly as her). Internet in several floors is hopeless. They have a few devices available for those who have bad internet connection in their rooms but they have this very limited. So if you are unlucky, you won't get one. She will open the drawer and show you that the device are all finished, and show you that kind of expression like ''so what else do you want me to do for you now?"" I am rating 3 stars here because the hotel does have some good points as it in it is located in the city center, very convenient. Breakfast is standard breakfast but overall, it is not a 5 star hotel. The maximum it can go is 4 star. Overrated. if you need some photos of the unfriendly staff with their unfriendly faces, I have some. Reply me below and I will share with you. I am being frank here to just help other travelers who are looking for a good stay. If you treasure your hard earned money and precious time, think again before you decide to check in to this hotel. TQ. 
"
"i had paid to be treated well in a five star hotel.. but unfortunately your hotel in casablanca was terrible... starting from the front desk one of the receptionists his name is abdelhamid and he was very very rude... i was complaining that there is a bad smell in my room and my sister room but no body cared to take an action and solve my problem."
"bad connetcion wifi, bad service of breakfast and burned coffee if you thonk to stay ina Movenpick 5 stars you are wrong this look like more a 2 star hotel.

Of corse the location is perfect with good coneection for business meeting all over the town"
"First impressions really do count. The exterior is very drab and rather dirty. The same can be said of the staff uniforms - torn, dirty and a mismatch of colours. 3 people on front desk, only one working. Check in took 15 minutes despite having prebooked and paid. As usual, got asked to pay another deposit despite the hotel already holding a sizeable amount. Up to the room through a warren of dirty, old corridors and into an adequately sized area. All amenities are there, they are either of poor quality or tired (bar the TV and bathroom amenities). Example being the kettle which needed a serious decontamination before use. Wifi was not an issue - it works but a bit slow. The on site restaurant is not to be recommended. Sub standard fare and a limited menu. Breakfast was better but still not up to 5* standard.

The staff seem friendly and keen to help but are just not trained to the required level.
Check out was another 15 minutes of crediting / debiting / signing.

Back to the Hyatt next time."
"I stayed here for work for 2 nights and left very underwhelmed. The staff were friendly and hotel reasonably clean. When you get to your room, you are greeted with some complimentary water. Good start. However, the wifi was abysmal. I was unable to contact my wife or daughter for 2 days because Whatsapp, Skype and FaceTime did not work. I told staff but was not offered any assistance. As I opted not to get my room tidied, I thought I would ask for more water on day 2. The reception said you only get it on the first day. While hotel was OK, it was nowhere near 5 star. 3 star at best, I have stayed at better 4 star hotels. "
"It doesn't look and give the service of a 5 star hotel, the staff members were not so friendly and also the rooms were not as expected. I do not recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking to experience a 5 star hotel standard "
"I stayed 2 nights in February  in this hotel despite the mixed reviews. Please note the wifi problem mentionned by several previous reviewers still exists despite the Manager's feedbacks below. 
I asked the receptionnist to get some help, he looked at the sheet with a ""process"" to get another wifi with a name with letters and numbers (meaning he never tried the ""Movenpick"" network - implicitly admiting it doesn't work) and seeing it didn't work, he advised me to go to the mezzanine floor ""because it perhaps works better"".
Sorry? Is this an answer by a hotel that is full of guests coming for business? I will not come back.

The room was OK (a Deluxe for 1600 Dhs/night) but the bed is a bit hard (beds at the Hyatt or Sofitel are much better), it needed some renovation (it becomes old-fashioned) and if you overlook the big avenue it is quite noisy. There was a cigarette smoke smell in the corridors, too...(it can come from the mezzazine bar, on the 00 floor, so you better avoid the 1-2 floors?)
The only positive thing is the rooftop bar and swimming pool (not heaten), with a view on the city.
"
"From the lack of soft skills expressed on the part of the front desk team to the billing inaccuracies which were not resolved, the experience was more like ""death by a thousand cuts"" than the relaxing experience that I had expected. This was a personal stay, so there was more time and opportunity to pay attention to the close details that separate an ""okay"" hotel from a ""great"" hotel...it's a stretch for me to even utter that this was an ""okay"" experience! If this hotel is your choice destination in Casablanca, approach it with a critical and keen eye for the details, voice your opinion strongly about the lack of service and/or errors that you experience, but be prepared for a lack of response in the end."
"I felt a lot of work is required to train staff further more you cannot find a waste basket in the whole lobby. Needless to mention the breakfast selection was extremely poor & people in the restaurant have no idea about service. They stay one side & keep chatting without servicing their customers."
"Not happy with the service provided and hotel management ability to think out of box and too bureaucratic. The hotel is providing free pick and drop online only in actual they have excuse we have not been notified etc etc"
"The hotel send you email of the agreed price when you arrive they don't consider what they send  and insist of taking what they want.       
Overall it's not more than 4 stars hotel and not 5 star hotel and will not visit it again for sure"
"We arrived at this hotel very late and exhausted. The reception staff was nice and friendly, but the rooms were miserable!
The view was literally blocked by an office building - so much for the panoramic view! We kept the curtains and blinds closed all the time.
The bathtub is clogged. The mould is everywhere in the wet areas. The carpet in the room ( and in all corridors) is dirty and old , and needs serious cleaning or replacement. Towels look like they have been used for ages, there softness and colour faded. We slept like dead log, and checked out as soon as we woke up. Never coming back to this place again."
"I have stayed at this hotel several times, and I can safely say that this hotel does not live up to the Moevenpick hotels standard. 

First off, I arrive at 1:30 PM and I was told that my room is not ready, as the check-in time is at 2 PM !! I ask to be put into any other room, I get the response of we are fully booked ! After much debate and willing to pay more, I was put in a room on the second floor........Turns out trying to sleep in that room was almost impossible since the windows are very thin and you can practically hear everything going on outside, I had to eventually sleep with my noise-cancelling headsets !!

On a different note, the hotel has a weird policy of only putting complimentary water once during your entire stay ! (I have never been to a 5 star hotel with such policy) !! The water in the mini bar smelled really bad, so I couldn't even drink that (the fridge wasn't working and had a bad odor) so I was left on my second night with no water !

Breakfast choice was very limited and I could hardly find anything to eat !

All in all, I would not recommend this hotel to anyone expecting a 5 star service!"
"My first stay at the hotel was great. I booked a second time but could not go because of a change in the schedule of my project, and they charged my credit card. Thats fine, as it was a non cancellable booking. I have been chasing them since August to simply send me a receipt/invoice for the charge so that I can regularise it with my company, but there has been no response! When I call they say we will look into it, but no status ever! It takes 5 months to give an invoice for money you have already charged?! And this after my company uses this hotel several times a month! Terrible!"
"This place claims to be a 5 star.  It is a 2 star at best.  The bathroom walls had urine stains, the sheets were dirty and the smell in the room was horrible.  DO NOT STAY here unless you are willing to pay a lot for a little and take a big risk.
      "
"Be very careful if you choose this hotel, the staff will steal and the hotel management will cover it up. Police would just get paid off and no one will do a thing about it. Even their central office in Europe will do nothing about it. Very intimidating and scary situation. 
Rooms are nice, restaurants and food are good, shuttle car to airport is comfortable. Nothing interesting near by just a busy business area but probably safer at night outside than inside. You've been warned."
"very noisy ... and expensive
If you want to stay awake all night because of works during the night in the room just near yours .. go to Movenpick and it will cost you all lot
The restaurant is not good and prices are 3 x higher compare to the rest of the city        "
"We stayed at this hotel in August during our business trip to Casablanca. First of all, it's not a 5-star hotel, not even a 4-star, according to the value of customer service, accommodation in general and design, as it doesn't reflect the qualities of a 5 or 4 star hotel. During our three nights stay we had more than a few unpleasant incidents with the staff. The housekeeping staff managed to enter our room without knocking for more than three times, they entered even when there was a ""Do Not Disturb"" sign on the door, they entered with same sign on again the next day after we had spoken with the management about this issue. Anytime we would call the reception for any kind of request (water, matches, cigarettes etc), it would take more than 40 min to be delivered. Some other times they would just not answer our calls, blaming it all on the bad line which by itself is already another issue. Elevators are super slow and out of four elevators one or two would always be out of service. On top of all this, personally, I think the whole place has horrible design and the worst color combinations. Our room, in particular, had a very bad layout, was not bright and was quite narrow. The only good thing was breakfast that had a large variety of options (despite the flies everywhere). There was one young waiter who was particularly nice with the service. 
Overall, we had better expectations for this place and were ready to pay a high price for comfort, quality and relax but in the end it turned out to be a huge disappointment, definitely not worth the price. "
"Decoration is poor, furniture was old. Room was not clean,dusty. Bathroom was a disaster. The hotels location is good but so much traffic causes too much noise so be ready. Hotel deserves a 3 star instead of 5. Spa and gym is so small. They put few dumbells and call that a gym.
      "
"Disapointment for a five star. I was not happy that I was asked to leave the breakfast table as time was up! It's not too bad as location is central. Near the mosque and souk. Pool is small and pedicure was very basic.
      "
"Carpet was gray and all stained, bathrooms not clean at all, sinks clogged, rooms black, red and white all over reminiscent of 70's tacky ... Missing a disco ball! 
On the plus the staff were friendly.
      "
"Stayed 2 nights.
Hotel was okay but service was poor.
Room hadn't been made up properly; no soap in bathroom or the complimentary water. Phoned reception twice to be told it was being sent but never arrived. In the end went out and spoke to someone at front desk on return who said he would send and sure enough he did. Just can't understand why something so simple couldn't be done.

Room wasn't made up on the 2nd day until the evening as we were still in the room when housekeeping came and they didn't bother coming back when we left to go out.

4 lifts but still took ages arriving as 1 seemed permanently out of service.

Parking is advertised as available but there is only a limited amount of hotel parking so really you will need to pay for parking at the nearby car park.

I wouldn't stay here again as there are plenty more hotels who provide better service for the price."
"This is not a five-star experience...

We stayed at Movenpick hotel in Casablanca from the 17th-19th of July 2015.
My husband and I chose the hotel based on the fact that they had a stunning pool on the roof top. At checking in, I asked about the pool and they just responded that it was closed for renovation. They offered beach access to a public beach instead. For me this is not an option, to sit in the car with my 1 year old daughter to a beach quite far away from the hotel. We chose the hotel based on easy access to the pool for my daughter.

As compensation they upgraded us to a junior suite. 
The mini-bar was never stocked, after several request, I gave up.

I changed into gym clothes and went down to the reception, I enquired where the gym was and they directed me to the 16th floor.
At the 16th floor they directed me to the 15th floor. I went to the 15th floor, it was an abandoned floor with no gym and just empty conference rooms. I went down to reception again and they then informed me that the gym was closed for renovation!

One evening I took the elevator down to the lobby and the elevator stopped and I was stuck for over 1h. In the end since no one responded to the emergency button I managed to send a text to my friend who informed the reception.

There is no changing tables in any of the bathrooms anywhere in the hotel. I was advised to change my babys diaper on the floor.

I will never stay at Movenpick again."
"After realising we were short on money, we attempted to change some at the desk. The lady that assissted us was very dismissive and unhelpful. In the end we exchanged some money. I checked the interest rate and it appeared that she had short changed us by 40 dirhams. And of course we were quite trusting at the time of purchase so did not ask for a receipt. I should expect at least that the staff in the hotel that I am paying for would not attempt to rip me off. 
To top that off, in was is arguably the busiest season of the year, the pool is closed. I've just looked and of course there is no mention of this on the website or at check in. Absolutely ridiculous."
"Hotel does not stand for a 5 stars as it says. The room is spacious but with old and ugly carpet that needs to be cleaned and replaced. Pool and spa closed for renovation without any previous notice prior to my reservation. Do not recommend it unless the price is reduced 50%."
"This is hotel is hard to find, all taxi drivers were not able to take there. I had hard time to reach the hotel, and I thought the name sounds but it is not in Casablanca. The Hotel doesn't look like 5 starts it is hardly 4 stars. the food's variety is very poor. the room was clean but the furniture and the bathroom seemed old. The hotel is far from the airport and far from the areas of shopping or sight seeing. Unless you are in a business trip and just need a place to sleep over, I do not recommend this hotel.  "
"This is NOT a 5* hotel. Not in any way. I travel regularly and I don't usually post any bad reviews. I used to believe that any random bad reviews had to be aggrieved customers or similar but in this case it is genuinely just a bad review! 

It wasn’t so much that when I went to check in they tried to bump me to another hotel as they had overbooked or even the way that I was kept waiting for half an hour at 10.00pm at night when I refused to be moved, it was the staff attitude when they said that, quote, ""its not our fault. We have 183 rooms and we have bookings for 200"" that really aggravated me! Having to argue that it WAS their fault is not pleasant! 

On checking in to the room the 1970's black and red 'disco' themed colour scheme was interesting but the condition was poor. Out of 3 blinds in the bathroom two were severely damaged and one was missing completely, meaning that I was in full view of the office block across from the hotel when using the 'facilities'. The paint was coming off and the damp marks in the roof were off-putting. Hardly 5*! Also in the room I had the step out of the 'shower over bath' onto wet tiled floors was tricky! If mobility is an issue, ask for a walk in shower or lower bath side, if they have them!

One thing to note. The culture in Morocco traffic is to sound car horns as a matter of course and this hotel is situated at a busy intersection. As soon as lights change the noise is extreme. So if you have to stay here ask for a room at the back, away from the intersection.

The pool area is on the roof and quite pleasant but small! Only 6/7 sunbeds but they don't clear the towels frequently so you never know if they are occupied or not. 

Trying to find positives. The room was large, the food was quite good but service was poor in reception if looking for coffees etc. 

Overall this hotel is less expensive than others nearby and its easy to see why. Its definitely not worthy of any 5* rating from anyone. Poor service and poor rooms don't qualify for such a rating. I would avoid and choose one of the other hotels."
"Our room was comfortable and breakfast, the only meal we had, was good. 
However, I could not possibly recommend this hotel to anyone because of a major security issue which I do not feel has been adequately resolved. We spent one night here in February 2015 at the beginning of an extensive tour of Morocco. Shortly after midnight I was woken by 2 people coming into our room. When I called out, they left and closed the door. A few minutes later our phone rang but the caller hung up when we answered it. I am sure the two incidents were related. I was very shaken by this as I had always understood that the key cards were unique to a guest and that it would be impossible to enter a room. After a very worrying night wondering whether the intruders were going to return we discovered that our key card which had been in the slot beside the door when we went to bed, had been removed. This meant that if we left the room, we had no way of getting back in, and someone else could get in while we were gone. My husband reported all of this to reception staff who apologised but blamed the housekeeping staff.
On our return to the UK I wrote immediately to the hotel manager explaining the whole situation and telling him that I could not recommend the hotel unless I had his guarantee that security has been improved. I have just (3 months later) received a reply which does not mention security and does not give me any reason to believe that my complaint has been treated seriously. So the same thing could happen again to other travellers."
"The reception staff although professional were extremely unfriendly and aloof. When I was unsure of where I should enter the wifi logins and asked I was given a look as if I was stupid and still had to work it out for my self with no help from the female receptionist. On my last night while I was out to dinner after 9 in the evening someone had entered my room and had moved articles around. I had used the safe for any valuables and nothing was missing but I felt my privacy had been invaded. I was very upset about this but did not report it as I did not want a scene and didn't want any confrontation. On check out at 7am the following morning the male receptionist spoke above me and seemed very annoyed that I wished to review my billing before payment. With my booking through an affiliate website I was quote for total payment and the billing had broken down payments per night , which I have no issue with but it had initially confused me as I also had additional items on the bill, again made feel uncomfortable for asking about it.,  The door men and all bar and restaurant  staff however were amazingly helpful and friendly.  I would have felt better about recommending the hotel to friends but for the fact that someone was in the room while I was out on my last night. I would worry about security."
"You would think that you pay for what you get.  Not for the Moevenpick Casablanca.  I usually stay at the Sheraton Towers Hotel Casablanca but it was fully booked in this particular week I was in town.  So, for the difference in price, where the Moevenpick is almost double the Sheraton's rate, I was very disappointed.  The staff were not friendly, customer service was at its lowest, my guests were insulted, breakfast was poor - food quality was below average for the rates they charge.  I had to live from my luggage for one week because the cupboard only had room for my suits and shirts!  You'd think at the rate you're paying that they would have double glazed windows to cut down the noise from the traffic & the neighboring streets.

Overall, the only good experience was the spa & the pool as they were located on the 16th floor, away from all the noise from below.

Im not so satisfied with my stay in tht hotel staff needs note training , renovations , and they have to work on their english ( i had to order omllete aroun 2 times bcz everytime the waiter says i understod sir an bringing it now and bring something else at end i googled it and showed him the pic, they need to work on the restraunt food regarding the diversity,staff should be more showing more interest into their guests , i remeber the incharge person in the restraunt was pointing at me as i was wearing a short during breakfast that is not appropriate and i have to go and change although the lady in front of rest let me in with no comment and there  was no clear instructions at door front stating such thing it was a very bad way,  , overall below expectations :("
"Lights didn't work, was told a technician would come and repair - no one showed up... was told my passports would be sent up in 15 minutes after registration - had to call and remind them after an hour...  expected A LOT more from Movenpick :("
"What a disappointment this hotel.  It starts at arrival.  A bunch of locals hang around the entrance.  Supposedly cab drivers.  Reception desk could not find my prepaid reservation.  All elevators rattle and shake like an airplane on turbulence.  WiFi does not work decent (except in the lobby). Room furniture is worn. Rented meeting room was not ready. Internets speed still way below acceptable despites all management promises (even on this website comments). Continuously being chased by hotel staff to sign for already paid bills.  Shower flooded bathroom every time.  And checkout again was a total disaster requiring 4 attempts before finally the correct bill was printed.  This might have been a grand hotel ages ago but now it is by most a 3 star.  Food in buffet is good."
"so happy I did not pay more than USD 100

horrible place, a mystery how it got any decent reviews

grotty carpets in the hall with dirty wall hangings

sink drain was stuck with water in it when I went in room

you can hear every automobile pass on the road"
"I guess smoking is a Casablanca thing because the hotel smelt like smoke, the entrance, the corridors, just about everywhere you went people were smoking. The water fountain outside the hotel doesn't work. What kind of 5 star hotel can't even keep up the appearance of their hotel. The hotel couldn't find our booking even though I had proof of booking from booking.com, so check in was a nightmare. We did eventually check in about an hour after arrival. The area in which the hotel is located looks fairly ok but we didn't venture out as it was almost 9 pm when we were eventually checked in. 

The hotel rooms are a decent size. Very modern and well decorated, although a bit on the dark side. The restaurant is very nice and they serve tasty food. There was a delightful gentleman Amid who was very friendly and helpful. He was the only highlight of Casablanca, one of the nicest people we met during our stay 

We asked for a taxi to the train station the next day and the concierge said he had organized two grand taxis. When we went to the taxis outside the hotel the taxi drivers were fighting and then the one old taxi driver bundled us into one taxi. 4 ladies with 8 pieces of luggage. This happened in front of the hotel staff, as the bell boy was even helping to put our luggage in the front seat of the car. We were quite horrified by this and we ended up fighting with the driver as he demanded 300 Dirham when we got to the train station. We were squashed like sardines in the back if that taxi and he still had the nerve to ask for more money. 

My experience in Casablanca was awful! It's not a tourist friendly city at all! The taxi drivers are always looking to rip you off. I will never go back there and have told everyone u know not to bother going to Casablanca.

"First of all, I've stayed in Movenpicks all over the Middle East and
they've been sensational, especially the one in Petra. That said, the
Movenpick in Casablanca is a joke. First of all, they refused to move my reservation
when I reserved under the wrong date so I lost my payment of one full night, when all they had to do was change it to the following day. 
After I arrived, it took them a full hour to check me in. The man at the front desk 
was nice but absolutely clueless. When I asked if the hotel could offer me a complimentary drink
due to the wait, he told me there was water in my room even though I didn't yet have a room. Later when I asked him for a converter for my US plug he said they had all been given to other guests yet when I asked the concierge a little while later, he effortlessly produced one. And by the way, no one told me the business center was being ""renovated."" Later that night when I ordered a Moroccan dish from room service they told me they don't make Moroccan food
""on Sundays."" Another indignity came when I asked for housekeeping in the evening (because I'd been sick all day) and when the maids came in I told them that all I needed were the sheets changed and new towels. I then left so they could work
but when I came back, they were gone and nothing had been done! I called reception and when they came back I asked them why they hadn't done anything
and they laughed and said they were ""called away.""
One final example of Movenpick's ineptitude came when I never received my wake up call.
All this unprofessionalism  for a hotel that charges $217 (160 euros) a night?? Never again."
"Service is quite bad here. It took me multiple emails and follow ups to get a confirmation that a van would be waiting for an airport transfer.

Hotel room is decently sized and clean. My main complaint is that they tried to charge an extra $75 USD for a guest when I mistakenly booked a 1 person room (even though this was a king bed room, and extremely spacious). All rooms in the US are double occupancy, so I admit that there may be local customs I am not aware of. When I challenged them on this matter, they initially tried to extract an extra $75, which would have made this a $200/night room, which it is not of that caliber. Ultimately they came down to an extra $25."
"My friend and I picked this hotel for our arrival to Morocco and we choose poorly. As two women arriving into Morocco on separate flights and times, we emailed the hotel before leaving home to ensure they could arrange taxi transfers for each of us. Even though the cost was more that a normal taxi we wanted to have an easy arrival and were happy to pay the hotels additional charge. We even telephoned them before leaving home to make sure all arrangements were in place. How disappointing it was to arrive at Casablanca airport to find that NEITHER of the taxis turned up.While this was disappointing, it was the attitute of the reception staff on arrival that was infuriating. They couldn't have cared less, and actually seemed annoyed by us asking why they didn't turn up. My friend had to get the hotel to pay the local taxi that she took to the hotel becuase the airport ATM wasn't working, so knew they had paid the driver the local (lesser) price. Even still, the hotel tried to charge the premium price for their 'private taxi' when it came time to pay the bill. We complained to the hotel manager and even he had a couldn't-care-less attitude. He just shrugged his shoulders. I don't know why their service is so poor - maybe it's because there's lots of tour groups that stay here so they think they don't need to worry about independent travellers. The rooms were fine but unfortunately the location is on one of the busiest intersections in Casablanca, so the traffic noise is relentless even in the rooms at the back. We'd also confirmed a twin room when booking and yet were given a double. Probably wouldn't have been annoying if our taxi's had turned up. When we returned to Casablanca before our flight home we stayed at the Park Suites Hotel - I wish we'd found this place earlier. The rooms were great, the location quiet, and the staff went out of their way to be helpful. Forget the Husa and stay at Park Suites."
"Stayed in room on side of hotel which faces the main road. Even with windows shut on 10th floor, the windowa do not seal 100% so loads if traffic noise, car and truck horns, emergency sirens and of course Call to Prayer.  I'm a heavy sleeper and I qoke probably 20 times due to the noise. 

Breakfast is a huge rip off. When I went there was no hot food or fresh bread available yet despite pointing this out Iwas charged 250dhs (£25 $40) for the privilage.

I wont be staying again."
"start with an insignficant reception where I am been obliged to carry my lugage alone. The porter present in front of the door,  was watching me carryng luggage from taxi withount help. Then i did not find the reservation I made by phone from airport. The price was that most hight one, the one published,  withount reduction being in the weak end. Then I spend a fortune just drinking a soft drink and a cofee. The given room was not ready and I had to wait more than one hour.  just correct the room (not really a 5* one!) The ony positive thing is the tramway just in fron of the hotel."
"After a trip to Marrakech,  I went to this hotel in casablanca. What a disappointment!!
Impossible to sleep after 7AM because the hotel is near a roundabout and drivers do not stop honking the horn.  Windows have are not doubled.
In addition I rarely saw the staff smiling. Never again I will go to casablanca for tor tourism nor for work. Burk :("
"We had an unpleasant experience in this hotel, which is currently called ""Husa Casablanca Plaza"" and managed by the Husa Group. Actually the bad feeling already started when booking through their own group website booking system. I made a mistake with the booking dates and tried hard to get in touch with them several times via emails and phone calls which they never replied, chasing them for days. 
The double room we booked through their website cost Euro 118.-- (including taxes). When we checked-out and had to pay the bill, the receptionist asked us to pay 132 Euro! We showed him our reservation but he justified that with the exchange rate difference (which is not specified anywhere in their website nor in the reservation page). We had a terrible argument and left frustrated and angry on our first day of holiday. We had another night booked at this same hotel on our very last night in Morocco, which we obviously cancelled.
The room was OK, though the standard of the hotel is far from being that of a 5-star (and also the cleanliness of the rooms!). 
There are better options in Casablanca, avoid this one."
"I can not recommend this place - for $150, got a dingy room, stale breakfast buffet and lukewarm water in the shower.
