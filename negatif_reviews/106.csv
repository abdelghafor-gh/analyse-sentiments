"A truly awful experience!
I stayed here with my friend who arrived separately to me. On arrival I was told I needed to pay the total amount of £600, up front, not realising that my friend who is an Accor member, had already settled prior to arriving. Once we discovered the mistake, we reported it and were told that no mistake had been made. The next day we met with the manager who apologised and assured us that one of us would be refunded within 7 days. Its is now 3 weeks later and we have received nothing, despite multiple follow up emails in which we’ve been told ‘the money is on its way! We were even asked to pay a third time upon checkout!!!!
Additionally, a couple of nights into our stay, we got home from dinner and could smell burning throughout our floor. Please see photos of the vacuum that had clearly caught fire at the socket and had just been left. I went straight to reception to report and no one seemed to know what I was talking about or care. What is more concerning than the faulty electrics, is that no smoke or fire alarm had been triggered by it. The issue was resolved by them closing the door to the room with the charred socket!
Further to the above I have also attached further photos of the poor quality of service -
Coffee and tea station not replenished, on arrival there were empty coffee sachets just left and no bottles of water
No hand soap in the bathroom dispenser for days 
The carpet was full of hair and had clearly not been vacuumed for a long time
Housekeeping only ever half made the beds
One bathrobe and one drinking glass for 2 people
We waited in a queue of people for 15 mins to get a towel for around the pool
Once round the pool no one came to take a drinks or food order
Rude unhelpful staff
The only one positive was a decent gym
I am still waiting for my £600 back for a stay that was not worth even half of that.
If you want a true experience of Marrakech that offers quality service and a beautiful clean environment, stay in one of the 5 star riads instead, you will only regret staying here."
"During my recent sojourn at this purportedly luxurious establishment, ostensibly for the purposes of a high-end travel program, I regret to report that my experience was nothing short of abysmal. While this hotel boasts a five-star rating, a designation that may be reflected in its architectural grandeur, the quality of service falls woefully short of such lofty expectations.

The culinary offerings, far from being the gastronomic delights one would anticipate from a prestigious hotel, were repetitive and uninspired. The menu's monotony was matched only by its execution, leaving much to be desired for even the most forgiving palates.

Perhaps most egregiously, the cleanliness of the accommodations was shockingly subpar. On two separate occasions during my stay, my quarters were inexplicably neglected, left in a state of disarray without so much as an explanation or apology. The absence of basic amenities such as a toilet brush or proper waste receptacles (save for a solitary bin in the lavatory) further underscored the hotel's cavalier attitude towards guest comfort and hygiene.

The front desk staff, far from embodying the attentiveness and efficiency one would expect from a luxury establishment, displayed a level of indifference that bordered on contempt. Even when faced with a growing queue of patrons, the receptionists seemed utterly disinclined to expedite their processes or offer any semblance of urgency in their duties.

In summation, while the hotel may lay claim to a five-star rating based on its physical attributes, the quality of service and attention to detail fall dismally short of such a prestigious classification. It is with great disappointment that I must advise potential guests to approach this establishment with considerably tempered expectations, lest they, too, find themselves victims of its myriad shortcomings."
"If 0 stars was an option that would be my choice. my sister and I stayed in Mövenpick Hotels Marrakech for 7 nights and the experience at the hotel was mediocre as a whole. On the last night, 6 hours before we were due to fly home the next morning my sister felt a sharp scratch on her foot, which I found strange as I had the same thing the night before. We investigated the situation and found a thick, long, sharp needle poking through the bed sheet. We took pictures of the needle and immediately went to the lobby to inform a manager. After talking to the general manager, we were laughed at by the staff. To make matters worse, the man we was talking to wasn’t even a general manager and was actually a bar manager. The whole 7 nights we have stayed the bed sheets have not been changed and we had the same bed sheets as the guests before us. We spent 2+ hours trying to get someone to resolve the situation and get a refund for compensation on the hotel and had nothing but disrespect and negligence from everyone we had spoken to. We came back to our room and they hadn’t even bothered to remove the needle we found! I’d recommend anyone that is planning on booking here to not. You will receive bad service and you will sleep in the same bed sheets as the people (s) before you had."
"Do not recommend, will not be returning. Expected a lot more from a Movenpick hotel. Check in took ages because of long queues - something I've never experienced before. Toilet was broken, power sockets did not work. Asked for kettle to be replaced and was told someone is on their way but nobody arrived (and wasnt even offered a tea for the inconvenience). Music by the pool is too loud. Avoid"
"It should be a crime to state that this is a 5* hotel!!!
Disclaimer: During our trip we stayed in an other 5* hotel also in Marrakesh, so don’t think it is all the same, the other was really good and effectively a 5*.
It started with the wrong foot, when I went to do the check-in (at 14:00h as I had previously made notice) and the employee said my room wasn’t available so I had to wait 1 hour in the lobby. After, I went to him again and he, being very rude, said he was in a hurry and could not take my payment, therefore I had to wait for other colleagues. Additionally, most of them don’t speak English, really forget it! You either speak French or Arab, otherwise they won’t understand nothing. That left me shocked in a 5* hotel. Moreover, the receptionists (because they do not speak English or just don’t know) are always sending you to the concierge when you have any doubts in hope he sells you a package of vacations or a trip to the desert and DONT respond to your questions.
The food in the restaurants is too much expensive, 50€ per meal (no alcohol or dessert) and not worth the price, at All! I ordered from Glovo after being disappointed and paying so much. 
Now, let’s start on why it was a terrible experience… The hotel is full to the maximum capacity at all times: 
1. Several times I wanted to stay in a sun bed in a pool and I did not have space. One of the times I had to put my towel on the grass (like other people) and another time I literally had to put my towel in a random chair from the bar because there was not the minimum space. This is definitely not ok in a so called 5* hotel. The adults pool had children and no space, the other pools were so full that there was not even 1 sun bed to lay my towel or to have some room in the pool. When you did you were swarmed by children/people and could not relax for a little bit.
2. The breakfast was one of the worst experiences I have ever seen in a hotel (remind you “5*”). Outside there were swarms of bees and wasps EVERYDAY and it was impossible to stay outside without having 10 bees landing on your plate. Inside looked like a busy cafeteria from school. The noise was so loud I could not even maintain a conversation with my wife. Children crying, plates falling… It was horrible. This is definitely a family oriented hotel (which I didn’t knew) so expect a lot, I mean A LOT!!! of children. Crying everywhere. But what shocked me the most was there was no space to have breakfast!!!! The two days we spent there, we literally had to wait for someone to leave a table so we could have seat. The floors were filled with food from the other guests, spilled milk, fruit… A mess!! There were so many people there that the food was always running out, you either waited for replacement or could not eat at you choice (again we are talking about a 5* hotel).
And the music… SO LOUD AT ALL TIMES, WHY?!?? It was impossible to relax.
3. The gym was chaotic, no AC, the water machine was broken, it was so hot and had so many people it looked like a commercial gym - my wife could not work out and went to the room, because it was so hot and the air was so dense.
4. The room is good and the hotel decoration is also good, but besides that, do not expect this to be a peaceful, well managed, 5* hotel. It is a mess because of the amount of people staying there, clearly surpassing the capacity of the hotel and the staff.
In summary: this is definitely not a 5* hotel and don’t expect it to be a calm nice trip. I dare say that there are more children than adults in the hotel (more than 2 kids per couple), the pools are always so full, no capacity left, the same with the breakfast hall, meaning you never have space, when you do, expect to hear children crying and fighting ALL THE TIME! It is miserable if that’s not what you are looking for.
Finally, I think next to the hotel there is a club or something like that that will blast music until 00h00 so don’t expect to sleep or just relax before that because your room will be shaking from the noise."
"We were meant to stay here for 5 nights and wanted to leave after our first night… thankfully our holiday package let us change to the much nicer CR7 nearby. NOTHING IN THIS HOTEL IS 5 STAR. They are no sunbeds available, people lie on towels on the grass, the pool is so busy you can hardly move in it and the only adult pool is tiny. The pools are dirty with hair and oil floating around. The rooms carpet are covered in hair and dirt and after asking 3+ times for someone to clean and moving rooms once still no one came. The lock on the room door had been completely broken smashed in so we couldn’t secure the door at night- security risk. The air con hardly works in the room in 45 degree heat. The breakfast is covered in flies, packed and cross contamination everywhere for allergies and meat. I’m so glad to be out of this hotel. Some staff were friendly like the concierges but the front desk staff are unhelpful and rude. We asked them to fix the air con and clean the room so many times and no one came so we had no choice but to leave for a nicer hotel. Would not recommend- a 3 star hotel for sure not 5."
"Stay here at your own risk. I am currently at this property. Pictures show the room I was given. All pictures were taken upon entrance to the room. Do be your own judge of the number of stars the hotel merits. For me, this is not representative of a 5 star property."
"Stayed for 3 nights.
Staff so rude (have no idea what is 5star hotel service) 
No multi plugs. 
Building no7 is right across night club ( you can dance all night in the balcony -.-)
 only 2 good things were good breakfast and big swimming pool.
We will never ever go back. 
What a wasteof money. "
"Hotel area and most of the rooms are nice looking and in relevantly good condition. Pool area is very nice - if you manage to get a sunbed. Breakfast is ok; there are thousands different things on the buffet, but practically all are missing taste. And because of omelette station, there is a constant smell of frying oil in the breakfast room.

Gym was under the renovation - there was no information about this beforehand - and some of the equipments were placed outdoors. Specially afternoons were very hot and training wasn’t very pleasant in the heat.

The reception is a total chaos and mismanaged. During our 1 week stay we stayed in 4 different rooms - thanks to reception. The highlight of their actions was our last whole day, when a housekeeping (that is excellent, special thanks to lovely Nawal) asked what time we are leaving. We didn’t know that we were leaving, but reception had decided to move us to another room for last night. There was only one pleasant person working in reception - big thanks to you, Hanane."
"The location is beautiful and I am enjoying most of my time here (I check out tomorrow) however beware: the shower doesn’t drain and will not only flood the bathroom but seep into the carpet outside. Initially I tried to deal with it by turning the shower off in bursts when I was shampooing/using body wash etc, however that makes for a very cold unpleasant experience. I informed the front desk that my drain wasn’t working and nothing was done to fix it, so I decided to just try to enjoy a shower because they clearly don’t care if it floods their hotel or creates a safety hazard on the slick bathroom floor. The pictures are from a 10 minute shower. I understand not everything can be caught ahead of time but don’t tell me you’ll fix the issue if it clearly isn’t a concern."
"The pool area is massively over crowded. The service was awful, particularly the bar when ordering drinks or food. A number of times our drinks and food did not arrive and when bought this to staffs attention they were rude. On average we were waiting 20 mins to get a drink and would have to go to the bar order it. Even then was frequently ignored. 

There were only 1 or 2 bar man to serve hundreds of guests and they were doing the best they could. But at least 5 managers watching, not adding any value to help in anyway. Very poorly run hotel with many managers but not enough serving staff. 

Despite it being 30 degrees plus, the hotel does not switch on the air con at this time of the year, to save costs. This is not what you expect from a 5 star hotel and will never return to an Accor hotel."
"Checked in at 9pm and we were hungry so after getting to the room which was fine we went to the buffet restaurant which was sub average and I hadn’t realised was 550mad each. The experience was worsened by a live music act playing at an insane volume to the point we had to shout to each other across the table we were in and out in under 30 mins - waste of money. 
Went to the bar where we were ignored after 15 mins of being ignored we left and went to bed. 
Around the pool it’s is absolutely packed not a bed , chair , mattress or lounger to be had after about 9:30am and the pool was the human soup variety of packedness. Went to try and buy a bottle of water at the bar after 10 mins of being ignored I was told I couldn’t buy anything till 12pm. Returned at 12 after 15 mins of being ignored finally got someone to give me a bottle of water and then the bill saga - the system they use seems to make it look like they are programming the re-entry coordinates for the space shuttle rather than simply billing a bottle of water - the general operations seems to be 1 maybe 2 people making drinks for hundreds of guests about 8 people serving the drinks being made by these 2 poor guys - 1 bewildered girl operating the till 2 wingmen watching her operate the till and 1 further one watching the other 3 and basically doing nothing. 

In other news 

Air con in the room useless just blows warm air around 

Toilet doesn’t flush properly 

Loo paper low quality 

Breakfast - acceptable 

Balcony microscopic - smaller than any cruise ship 

Location decent 

Reception areas attractive

Peacock - annoying at 5am 

Taxi drivers nightmare trying to rip you off constantly 

Would I stay again - nope"
"We stayed here on a visit to Marrakesh for a few days and I can honestly say it’s the worst hotel experience I’ve ever had! Having visited Marrakesh frequently over the years, there are some fabulous places to stay. We opted for The Mövenpick on this occasion and deeply regret it! Despite there being a surplus of staff, service was terrible, especially around the pool area. On one day we ordered drinks and food and it never arrived, another day it was cold after a 40 minute wait. We waited at the bar to order overpriced drinks and still had to wait 20 minutes. We made a table reservation at the hotel restaurant and they gave it to someone else. The air con didn’t work and the management said they don’t put it on until later in the month, despite it being 32c outside!? We spoke to quite a few guests who were equally as frustrated. I could keep adding more issues but suffice to say, this is far from a 5* hotel. Too many managers walking around doing nothing and not enough efficiency and urgency in meeting guests’ needs! Unless you like long waits and inept service I’d avoid this place at all costs. We will never return!"
"Let’s begin with the good, the entrance is beautiful!
Ok now to the bad, check in was terrible. It took forever to get checked in and they had mass confusion over our two rooms. 
We booked one queen room and one with two beds. We ask if we have two beds they confirm yes, we get to the room and one bed, we complain and they bring two additional roll out beds which gives us zero room to move around.
The rooms hot, wait what! We have NO AC! I ask the front desk and they say they will fix it, we leave for our activities and get back to sleep and still no AC. Wake up the next day not well rested because we were sweating all night. They again say they will fix it. Get back at 4PM and still no AC. Call down again and they tell me it’s out in the building… except we have two rooms and the other is cool. 
Breakfast, coffee machines are not working, we finally found a working one and used the same button to get two different coffees.

Will not stay here again and I recommend you don’t either.
This is NOT a 5 star hotel and I assure you I will never stay in another Movenpick. This place is awful unless you want no AC and broken amenities and lies from the staff with confusion added in."
"Definitely not a 5 star hotel and worth my time to review. Beyond disappointing on too many levels. Movenpick, you should be ashamed of your brand!
Poor service levels, basic accommodation, below standard hygiene levels and a chaotic breakfast buffet."
"I have had a very bad experience in this hotel. Having booked at a very high price, the hotel gave me an incredibly noisy room where I did not manage to sleep! I also wanted to shorten my stay there but they did not accept to refund the payment I did  neither to make a credit note which is not acceptable given the ranking of the hotel. Client service is not at all the one expected in hotels in that category!"
"Hello! We were traveling from ATL to Paris then to Marrakech. So long travel leads to being tired and just want to rest when you get to your hotel. Our stay started off really bad with check in. We were told we would check in around 12:30pm. When we get there we were told to give them a few mintues. Then few turned in ""13minutes"" two times. We left and ate lunch. Came back and wanted to check in and room wasn't ready. Then we finally check into the hotel room and the room was dirty. The shower head was not clean. The sinks were not clean and had hair in the sinks. We had no hand or bath soap. We had no wash clothes or linen. We had no hangers for the clothes in the closet. I had to go to the maids next door to get these items myself. My wife decided to take a shower because it was 13+hrs of traveling. The shower did not drain and water was just sitting in the shower. The room as well was facing a parking garage, when we asked for city view. The hotel did not want to change our room as they were ""fully booked"". I had to call AMEX (who we booked the hotel through) in order for the hotel to want to accommodate us on the short comings in the check in process and the room uncleanliness. They showed us several rooms ""available"". Finally we get to the same style room but actually facing the city. She said this was an upgraded room and we were not to be assigned to the room. Even though this was the room I actually paid for, I did ask her at check in if there are upgraded rooms available. She said no. Just whole process and service throughout the stay was not great at all. Needs better service and make guests feel welcome and accommodated. Hotel is beautiful but lacks good restaurant, lack of alcoholic beverages, lack of service. We had to go to someone if we wanted anything, not once was it the other way around. "
"We didn’t have a good experience. The management had clearly over booked the hotel. The was a private party that took over the whole of the lower pool , cramming everyone else into the other, nice but crowed pool where almost everyday there was a fight for sun beds. Only the Spanish restaurant and the buffet were open the other restaurant, the Healthy option and the Moroccan one were closed over the whole Easter- something which the evening concierge did not know. Breakfast was great and waiting staff fabulous so we’re the maids but clearly the management team had over booked. We are unlikely to return."
"Awful mistake staying at this hotel. he hotel was half filled with Passover event over the Easter which made it a very unpleasant stay. Due to the high amount of people the sun loungers were literally on top of each other with most of them being reserved by 8am. The main pool had about 30 kid at any one time. Absolute mayhem. The staff are rude and so is the hotel manager. The food was terrible too ever so bland had no taste whatsover. As soon as the passover finished another corporate event took over so the second pool was out of action again. Terrible place I will never again stay at Movenpick hotel after this experience. "
"I choose this hotel hoping that the movenpick quality would stand up in Marrakech,  however this was not the case. The check in was a joke 5 staff standing around not wanting to work and it continued.  The room had not been cleaned properly especially the bathroom and cigarette butt's all piled up on the balcony in this non smoking hotel.  Thankfully the hotel was quiet so finding quiet space by the pool was OK but I reckon in season it wouldn't be pleasant. The outside pics imply that the hotel has lots of space which is not the case  2 pools and that's it.  ALSO be warned that taxes and fees were added to my bill that they could not be justified and said they were local, when I asked for clarification they couldn't answer me. Fraudulent. My booking never mentioned extra fees and all fees had been included at the time of booking and payment. "
"The service at the pool is the worst I have ever endured in my lifetime.
The staff ignore you then say I’m busy no time and so what and try to fight you.
Calling the manager is pointless as he just laughs at you. 
Also I asked for an adaptor for my room and had to chase this up so many times 
Even towels 
The hotel has to be the worst service ever.
I would never recommend to anyone to endure such a terrible experience."
"From the check-in process, the staff seemed very disorganized, although they were courteous. The whole hotel looked old/aged and needs a general refurbishment from the spa facilities to the room I was staying in. I called room service several times over my 3 nights stay for different requests (refilling of shower gel, request for iron to the room etc.) which either took a very long time to arrive or never arrived.

What I am most unhappy and disappointed about is that fact that the front desk firstly decided to take a MAD 21,000 security deposit from my credit card on arrival without informing me of the amount prior to attempting to debit me. I had assumed they would pass a charge for the room balance for my non-refundable booking, and it was only after entering my pin and when additional authentication was required, that I realized and challenged this. It was only at this point that I was offered the choice of paying for any amenities on demand or keeping a hold on my card.
Following this, on departure and after settling all my bills, I was told that the hold on my credit card had been released but this does not appear to be the case as the hold is still reflecting on my card after over 2weeks. I have called several times requesting to speak to the reservations and reception teams, but people either don't pick up the phone, drop the phone after it rings for some time, tell me they are busy, or that they will investigate without obtaining adequate information from me to look in to the issue and contact me back. One lady asked that I call the following day and ask for Mr. Abdoulate, but I have not able to get in touch with him or anyone else competent enough to help. It feels like no one wants to take responsibility for resolving it.

The only reason why Movenpick is getting 2 stars is because they provided early check-in as requested. And also because the staff at the poolside restaurant were attentive and the food specifically by the poolside was decent. I tried the free breakfast buffet only once, but the quality and spread was really poor, so I decided not to go back and chose to eat early lunches by the poolside which came at an additional cost."
"The hotel managers are rude and will not accommodate you. The pictures of the rooms are not what the rooms are. They won’t provide good bedding and the hotel felt dirty. I do not recommend staying here. Calling it a 5 star hotel is a lie. They should be ashamed to call themselves luxurious"
"Beautiful grounds, spa, and pool, room was acceptable, and hotel had a nice selection for breakfast. Note there is no indoor pool as mentioned on TA page, but the temperature in the heated outdoor pool was very pleasant in late November.
HOWEVER!
This is NOT a four-star hotel. Most of our interactions with staff left us inconvenienced and with the impression they are either very overworked, unhelpful, or untrained. 

-Housekeeping was overworked and semi-responsive

-One staff member told me to go next door to heat up my baby food while said baby was crying; it would have been nice if they took the 30 seconds to do it themselves

-One staff member ""showed us"" where the spa and restaurant when asked by walking us all the way through the hotel before emphatically pointing and rudely saying ""reception""

-The front desk fully charged us for our dinner in hotel restaurant Marcelona and tried to blame us, after I mentioned we had traveler's diarrhea (we lost an entire day in the bathroom) from the tap water in the gazpacho that night (they could have at least apologized)

-After reassuring us of the cost of a taxi to town, concierge told us to get one ourselves ""just outside"" where the cost doubled...

Too many negative experiences to list here. We are not high maintenance by any means but did expect a much higher level of service here. The riads in Marrakech were by far less expensive and more friendly."
"Good 5* Hotel with 2 star service Hotel is good location. Rooms are large and nice. 
Bed comfortable. 
TV not working. 
Restaurant food - reasonable 
Restaurant service - soso. 

Front Office service is very very poor. Except for Ms Hanane & Nezha, the other front staffs are very “cold” and irresponsible. 
1-Triple room with only 2 sets of linen. Despite repeated requests and reminders, nothing done. 

2-No morning calls for my group on Departure day despite prior arrangement. 

The worst staff is Hassan (Reception) he has a very bad attitude. Does not believe in providing service to guests. I stay in this hotel with a contingent of 20 guest. I was responsible to provide information to my group. I asked Hassan many questions and directions, he did not provide any. Has a “don’t bother me” attitude. Very COLD attitude with Arrogance does not bother to explain clearly and poor command of English. 
Cannot understand how Movenpick management can employ such staff."
"Unfortunately this was one of the worst hotel stays we have had. 
- check in took one hour after travelling all day since 5am with 2 small children. Waited 4 hours for the room to be ready at 4pm
- room not what we requested (ground floor suite) it was higher up and awful with one tiny window
- cot and single bed not in room as requested took hours of chasing to get it 
- promised the ground floor suite after breakfast next day. Queued 40m at front desk not ready. Told to come back at 3. At 3 told to come back at 5.
- wifi did not work in new suite impossible to stream a tv show or check in flights. Technicians came and went taking a up a whole afternoon no communication and no solution 
- terrace door did not lock totally unsafe 
- every interaction with front desk was dreadful taking one hour with queuing and nobody being trained to know how to deal with basic requests. Totally understaffed many people waiting and upset in line 
- booked airport transfer to leave and it did not show up it was never booked we arrived late to the airport 
- terrible service staff could not care less at the front desk about your experience and keeping you waiting 
- hotel grounds are nice pool is good and breakfast we did a mountain tour that was very good but overall we could not wait to leave 
Not 5* "
"We stayed at Movenpick Marrakech for 7 days and were overall disappointed with our stay. Even though the hotel is rated as a 5 star, the service we received was very poor and definitely not one of a 5 star.
We noted several issues during our stay, none of which is the fault of the staff working there (the cleaning ladies were very nice and always happy to help) or but more a reflection of how poor the management of the hotel is:
- bathroom towels: There’s clearly a shortage of towels across the hotel, which meant all towels and washed and redistributed in the evenings. Times where we would come back to the room and werent able to take a shower. We called reception on a daily basis to get towels and they would sometimes take up to an hour to bring the towels delaying our plans for the day - we even ended up using the bathrobes as towels on 2 of the days.
- toilet roll: again, on several occasions, we were left without toilet roll. We called housekeeping at least 4 days out of 7 to be given toilet roll as this had not been replenished. Once requested, this again took hours to come.
- water bottles: in a 5 star hotel in a country where it is 30-35degrees, water should be free & readily available. We were given two 33cl water bottles a day, and could only get more on request.
- milk: even 1 star hotels have free cream available to be able to make tea or coffee in your room. In this hotel, they didn't have any creamers available and we were informed a glass of milk to make tea would be an additional £5 charge
- bathroom standard: the toilet lid in our room was half broken - it would close itself once sat on the toilet. This was very offputting and something pretty basic to get right for a 5 star hotel.
- hotel restaurant: we arrived around 8pm on the first day and decided to get food at the hotel. The only restaurant available was a tapas bar, in which the food was not only poor but very expensive. We had to spend more than £60 for 2 starters and 2 mains which we didn't enjoy. The hotel has at least 4 different pools but only restaurant of overpriced bad food for dinner.
- breakfast: coffee and tea should be served at the table in a 5 star hotel - in this hotel, you have a coffee machine where you make the coffee yourself.
- reception: if you have any queries for reception, expect to spend at least 20mins there.
- check-out process: not friendly, the staff didn't ask us how our stay was, we were just given our bill and asked to pay.
- the only upside to this hotel was the staff at breakfast, the cleaning ladies and outside of the hotel (pool & hotel entrance): they were all very nice and were always happyto help and we're grateful to them
Overall having stayed at several 5 star hotels, we can guarantee this is not a 5 star. Save your money and stay somewhere else."
"This hotel should not be parading as a 5 star hotel.  The hotel is run down, the carpets in the rooms, corridors and communal areas are worn, some areas have grey tape to cover up things, stains everywhere.  The sofa in my room had stains on it. The service in the restaurants is awful - given a basket of bread that had a half eaten bread roll in it.  The resort is quite expansive, but unfortunately nothing is really sign posted so you could spend ages looking for the gym, the main restaurant etc.  I booked a twin room but was given a room with one bed. The breakfast buffet was awful - coffee and tea machines for hot drinks (very tacky and not what you'd expect for 5*), fruit and veg completely abysmal.  Had they presented as a 3* hotel and adjusted the daily rate, then I'd be hailing this place as great value for money.  Only redeeming feature is the staff - very friendly.  If you are expecting luxury and top notch service, then give this one a miss, save your money and stay in a riad or even a tent in the desert as that would be better value for money."
"We checked in to our deluxe room, and it was a horrible stay. First off, the deluxe room building is the furthest building away from the hotel, and by the time we get to our room, the view from our balcony is of a construction site and parking lot. 

Our room had a particularly strong vinegar smell to it, and we asked to move rooms. We were told that every deluxe room was sold out and we would be able to move rooms the next day. Next day comes around and we didn’t hear from the hotel. Every call to guest services took at least 3-5 minutes until someone answered or called back. We also came back to our hotel room unlocked, and it seemed housekeeping didn’t truly close our door when they cleaned it. 

On our last night, the A/C didn’t seem to work. We called guest services and the lady I spoke to told me that it was turned off for the whole hotel. When asked why or when will it be turned back on, she abruptly interrupts me and says I’m transferring you to the front desk. I waited for at least 2 minutes on the phone before someone from the front desk to answer my call, and he informs me that someone will come check our A/C. 

We love staying at different hotels in different countries and had no issues with other hotels in Marrakech, however, our stay at Movenpick was very underwhelming and staff didn’t seem to care at all. 

This has been a very awful experience, and hope that the hotel management can make a much better experience and improvement for others. "
"Check in was fine after an overnight flight, rooms were ready when we arrived at the hotel, hotel looked beautiful, in the evening we could hear loud loud music in the room, it was from the hotel opposite, it felt like we were literally on the doorstep of a night club, we had booked 3 rooms, this is the last thing we needed with children, we could not sleep till the music stopped at 12am, took 3 phone calls and 2 hours later before the hotel finally agreed to swap rooms, this is the last thing you need after you have unpacked and settled in your room, had issues with air conditioning in the room, engineer came at 11pm did something but make no difference, we ended up trying to sleep sweating in a room with aircon not working, it was horrible. Following morning I rang reception for bath towels, 1 hour later still no towels, ended going look for towels myself and had to help myself from the store room,  went to the reception in the morning to change the rooms, was told someone would come and show us round the new rooms before we moved waiting 15-20 mins on reception no one came got fed up and went back to my room, eventually a gentleman showed up outside my room and took us to our new rooms.

We are still on day 2 of our holiday.

To conclude 
If you are after the 5 star Jumeriah experience, this is definitely not for you, as customers seem to be at the bottom of the pecking order, also been told the music situation is a daily thing, if you are an early person or have young kids who go to sleep early or before midnight you may need to think again, if you expect quick service ie need towels in 10-15 mins again you need to think again, personally am a service person, the service I have received so far, I would not be coming back to this hotel, as am only here for 5 nights and had so many issues already. 

I hope this review helps making you choice."
"I am on my 2nd here , staying at room 3233, I only booked this expensive hotel due to the main pool but it has been booked out for last 2 days for a conference. So all residents have to make do with a really small pool which you see in 3 star hotels at best. I came here 8 weeks ago and stayed at the riad dar anika which service is 10/10. When checking in I was told the pool will be available tomorrow which it wasn't. Also sitting here at the pool restaurant I have has to wait 15 mins to be served and there are about 4 staff and only 10 tables. Not looking forward to the next 5 days at all. "
"I created a TripAdvisor account specifically to warn you against visiting this hotel. I wrote this review after visiting the hotel but it had been sitting in my review drafts since ny visit! There are so many problems associated with this hotel that I just can not mention them all. We stayed here for 8 days. I have split the review into Accommodation/resort, dining and service. 

I will start with the accommodation/resort: The main pool was ridiculously overcrowded and freezing cold. I have no idea why they did not turn up the heating a bit more. It was really unpleasant to swim in. There was another pool near the Abou Faris buildings, that was even colder than the main one! Absolutely freezing! It was also filled with lots of dead bees floating on the water. The suite was good, spacious and the Moroccan theme adopted throughout (including the furniture colours) was very nice. This is where the positvies end. The bathroom door was broken and did not lock properly. The layout of the building was ridiculous; directly above us was the penthouse's wooden boarded balcony. This penthouse was filled with 20 Party-lovers. You could hear them running around, junping in their plunge pool and shouting, as well as playing music. After a few sleepless nights and multiple complaints we were moved to another suite. This was the same suite category but much much larger, this left us wondering why they had not given us this earlier!? (As it was the same suite category, not an upgrade). Build quality here was poor too which meant (broken bathroom door again) we frequently saw spiders and large numbers of other unknown insects from the building. 

Dining: Absolutely terrible! First day ordered room service and we were charged the 5 star hotel price of £20 for a burger with chips and £4 for a coke. But the problem is the burger tasted horrible! The inside was red (having told them well done wanted) and uncooked, smelled really bad. I would not be surprised if it was donkey meat! Then we tried the 'Dada's diner' cafe/restaurant. This was nothing special, the food was 'okay' at best, yet still 5 star hotel price. The breakfast was okay. Good choice and variety but actual quality was rubbish (don't go near the hashbrowns or sausages). The breads and Moroccan breakfast (pancakes?) were good. The Marcelona restaurant was okay nothing special, we did not like the tagine at all though. Jamra was okay. 

Service: By far the worst of the three categories. Horrendous. Poolside service = RUBBISH, had to ask 4 times for a menu. Asked for ice cream and changed our mind for a different flavour, the attendant rolled his eyes! 

Just avoid this hotel if you're expecting a 5 star hotel. We went the nearby Four Seasons for dinner a couple times and it seemed much better, though they were charging more than The Ritz London which seemed silly."
"I have booked this hotel for my parents and I have paid the total amount including taxes through Ctrip. When they were checking out, the hotel stopped them saying that the paiement didn’t go through and that they couldn’t leave. I spent almost 2 hours between talking to Ctrip operator and the hotel receptionist because she was claiming that there was an issue with the paiement. In the meantime, she didn’t want to let my parents leave until the issue gets fixed even though she knows that we already pre-paid the booking. As a 5 stars hotel, I think the least thing they should do it to not include the client in these matters and maybe review and fix their paiements before the check-in or during the stay. Beside that, the receptionist was extremely rude and totally unprofessional. 
This experience was one of the worst situations I have been through and I don’t suggest this hotel for anyone, they should at least train their receptionists to behave in a professional way and to learn the BASICS of tourism industry."
"The staff were lazy and clueless a typical example of a budget Hotel company trying to go upmarket. we paid extra for a Suite and it had no Air Conditioning so they moved us to another room after arguing for hours, then the new Suite the taps fell off so for two days we couldn’t shower or bath! eventually they fixed it and it lasted 24 hours until they fell off again and we couldn’t turn the shower off so the room filled with steam. A NIGHTMARE and no one cared at all, do not stay here there are fantastic Hotels in Marrakech this is NOT one of them"
"Read the negative reviews. They are reflecting the truth. 

Quality if the hotel:
The hotel looks amazing from the outside. The lobby is incredibly beautiful. At first sight this continues throughout, but then scratching only very little under the surface you will find that it was extremely poorly maintained. The loungers by the main pool are all broken. Their mattresses seem intact but never cleaned. The day beds once had cloth shades that now are all damages so that only very few even have them and those that do rather resemble little make shift tents than day beds. The number of umbrellas by the pool is very limited and most stands are damaged and not properly maintained.
Even in the rooms the toilet seats have scratches. House number 7 is facing a night club and the music there is so loud that sleep is impossible to be found. This however staff rectified quickly by giving us another room in house number 6. An upgrade to a suite which we appreciate, unfortunately still affected by the noise of the night club. 

Service quality
Most staff are friendly and polite. Unfortunately often not very helpful. I once ordered a wine while resting by the pool. Apparently they had run out which is fine. What is not fine is that they instead of informing me about this they just never showed up anymore until i chased them up. More than two hours later i finally got a wine. Thanks for the effort, but two hours is too long. 

Restaurants
There are several restaurants, some of which appear to be closed. We had dinner there one night which was alright but not great. 

Spa/Hamam
The Hamam is undergoing renovation. The staff apparently doesn’t know for how long as it’s in conjunction with a rebranding exercise… the Spa unfortunately also fell off as some staff was improperly trained and the renovation noise from the Hamam prevented a relaxing experience. 

Summary
Unfortunately not the stay we had signed up for. Also not what we were used to and expected from Mövenpick. 
For a 6 year old hotel that costs north of €200 during off season one expects a but more."
"When we arrived the room smelled TERRIBLE like sewage. AC did NOT WORK - the hotels front desk staff was extremely rude to a level where we had to leave the hotel. Disgusting experience and the hotel didn’t bother to amend the situation. AVOID. We were in room 2317. Expedia wasn’t helpful either in doing a refund and we stated at la Mamounia instead."
"My worst experience in all movenpick hotels as well as ALL accor hotels. The lady in the reception her name is Hind was too rude with zero hospitality skills and not even smiling. I asked for my usual upgrade as gold accor member and she refused. She was so impolite and she didn't even provide the welcome drink  that is granted for accor members worldwide."
"It’s 7:06 Am and I can’t sleep because the hotel reception is claiming that there is no A/C. He claims that the system is only used for heating. I can’t sleep and I hope that the hotel management checks call records or who is on duty today during this time because this doesn’t make sense at all. After several calls he said that he will send someone however, I have been waiting and they don’t answer the calls anymore. I am sitting outside because of the heat."
"There is no doubt this hotel is beautiful but for the amount of money I paid, it was sub-par. First, do not book any excursions through this hotel. I booked an excursion through them and paid more than booking through the tour company. They scam you into booking tours and excursions with them and take a huge cut. Honestly, don't use the hotel. 
Second, the staff is lazy and rude! The bell boys stand around watching people and talking. When we asked for directions to the square, the guy was so vague and nonchalant. He told us it was a 10 minute walk... It is not! The man at the Chocolate Hour asked me if I was staying at the hotel while I was helping myself. Excuse me? The worst was when the AC didn't work at night. My mom couldn't breathe and it was like a sauna! We called numerously and one person hung up on us!!! We lost an entire night of sleep and we were wrecked the next day. Of course, management was no help and didn't make it right. Save your time and money. There are a lot if beautiful hotels in Marakesh. Find one that has beauty and good service!"
"I and my husband joined Insight Vacations for Morocco tour. We arrived in Marakech on Dec 25, 2019 and stayed there for 2 nights.  Our Tour Director handed us the room key and confirmed that our room was twin bed as we strongly requested upon booking the tour. We  were shocked the room given to us was not twin, instead it was double bed. The staff then re-arranged twin bed for us. However when we opened the door, someone was still occupying the room with her stuff all over the bed, so we quickly closed the door and informed the staff. They did not seem to show any concern or apologetic at all. Thereafter, the staff again re-arranged another twin bed for us which was away from the group.

On the same night at around midnight, after washing my hair only then I realised the hair dryer was not working, so I called the receptionist/front desk to get the replacement and told him that I need it urgent as my hair was wet, after having waited for 15 min no one came so I called again, the receptionist informed me only 1 staff was working that night however he promised to ask the staff to attend to my request first before attending to other calls. I waited for almost 1 hr still no one turned up so I came down with my messy hair to approach the front desk it was about 13-15 minutes walk from my room (2 ways). When I checked with him, he didn't respond instead he quickly made a call using his cellular phone, after waited for over 5 minutes I interrupted him to ask if he has got the replacement hair dryer, he asked me to wait as he was checking with the staff on the phone, only after almost 10 minutes, he showed me the photo on his phone that the hair replacement dryer was already hanged on my room door handle. When I left my room, it was not there. I felt very frustrated and furious with the staff attitude. I should say almost all the staff are not friendly and helpful. Someone from our group also complained that front desk didn't pick up her call, another said she asked for iron board but didn't get it. No doubt that probably it was during holiday season where the hotel was crowded, and the staff was busy, but in the hospitality industry this kind of attitude is definitely a no no..."
"The experience was not 5 star, we paid extra for a room garden view result of it we were next to a big outdoor condenser that we could hear while trying to sleep.. 
Service is so so... i would not recommend as you will have for a lower price much better alternative arounds..."
"If your looking for 5 star service then this is not the place. We stayed there for 6 nights and had multiple issues, during the night our shower went off by itself multiple times. I told the manager Amin who was very hard to get a hold of then finally when we did speak to him he was very dismissive of the issue and didn’t have any empathy of the fact that we both had a sleepless night and as a result told us we could change rooms with no upgrade offered, this was on day 5 so we asked him to send a technician to fix the problem which was fixed finally. He then offered us a drink at the bar, I was horrified by his response and refused that and said you should be offering us a lot more than a drink he then went onto say well you can have a meal. I’m sorry but if I can afford to stay in a 5 star I can for sure afford a drink and the meal the way it was presented to us was as if he was giving it as charity, and did not properly invite us to have dinner at the restaurant so we didn’t go. He never followed up to see if the shower was fixed. Worst service I’ve ever received. The only thing this hotel does have is great breakfast the chefs were amazing and the location is great too. I’d personally avoid it and stay in an all inclusive like the be live collection hotels. Never again. "
"If you want to enjoy your stay.avoid any contact with this person.so rude doesnt know how to speak with the clients.infortunately there is a lot of good hotels at marrakech.never come back.No thanks.."
"Not sure how this is considered a 5 star hotel but it doesnt fly by my standards. I met 2 friendly staff members and thats about it. The hotel room is small, okay, however the shower pressure or just the shower head was so poor that my head was basically against the wall in order to get water on my head. The hose that is next to the toilet was broken and broken on the wall as well. The toilet stopped working at one point and didnt flush and my biggest concern was the the sliding door (we were on the first floor) didnt even shut / lock. I couldnt sleep the entire night knowing that the door was just open. zero security around the premises (unlike the four seasons). Our suitcases were lost so we had to keep calling out to call our credit card company and airline and we had to call the reception everytime in order to do so. At one point they would just hang up the phone on me when I would ask and it happened multiple times. When I asked for an iron it never came. These are all scenarios that I would not expect to happen at a 5 star hotel. The breakfast was alright.. eggs were all under cooked and by that i mean raw. While the spread was huge the quality was not. Needless to say, i cancelled my next night and stayed at the fours seasons. I will give it this much, it is very close to the medina and the mall. so for location purposes its good."
"Me and my friends stayed here for 4 nights in the junior suites. 

The hotel is in a great location, scores of restaurants and the mall close by.  It is also close to the airport around 10-15mins via taxi which is great after travelling all day so you can get to your room and relax asap.  NOT in our case, we arrived at the hotel around 8pm and our rooms were not ready. I found this absurd as that room would have been empty when the previous guests checked out at the very latest 11am that day.  Reception simply told us to wait in the lobby.  I was not happy and after complaining was offered a drink. I said I'm hungry after a long day of travelling and to the hotels credit they gave us pizzas and drinks by the pool free of charge. 

The junior suites were incredible inside, spacious, luxurious, huge balcony with comfy sofas and tables, stunning lounge area, huge bathroom with 2 sinks and extra toilet and sink in a separate area incase the bathroom was occupied. The downside is the walls are paper thin so you will be disturbed constantly if the suite next to you is occupied. DO NOT use the mini bar as each drink is extortionate, instead go to the shop across the road and stock up on drinks. You would have thought that at a five star hotel staying in a suite paying what we paid for the rooms that the drinks in the mini bar would be complimentary.  My friends who were also in a suite aircon did not work very well.  They asked reception to fix this and eventually complained but this was never sorted.

The hotel is huge and does not have enough pools or sun loungers to accommodate the volume of guests. Although you get towels from the pool staff, they allow people to leave those towels on the loungers and go back to their rooms. People had to resort to putting towels on the grass next to the pool to sun bathe. 

Overall I had a less than satisfactory stay. I really did love my suite when of the 4 days 2 days were quiet as there were no occupants next door. Breakfast was standard average.  I would not recommend staying at this hotel as there is always a long wait at reception as there is clearly not enough staff and you will always struggle finding a sun lounger. Air con not working seems to be a common problem as We saw and spoke to a few other guests experiencing the same issue. The mini bar prices are a joke, the amount added to our check out bill was insane, £6 for a can of Coke Zero as an example.  This hotel has a long way to go. Me and my friends have fallen in love with Marrakech and are coming back in 2020, but will definitely not be staying here."
"This hotel should never be a 5 star. Maybe maybe it should be a 4 star. All over booking places it says family hotel, that’s ok, because it’s lots of pools. So you think that’s no problem. But this hotel should be named to Movenpick KIDS hotel. Way to many kids. And the hotel is big. There is not enough sun beds at all! People wake up at 8 in the morning and “reserves” the beds, even the swim guards reserves for family’s and they get paid by them! This is very annoying, and the hotel just accept it!
The breakfast is the same every day! 
The rooms are old, the aircoindition in the rooms sounds like a jet engine. It’s a a lot of loud music at night. I recommend this hotel ONLY for family’s with kids! 
This hotel is just hyped up by the name. 
"
"PROS:
The hotel and grounds are lovely.  The staff of the restaurant and restaurant was extremely good.  Unfortunately, those positives end there.

CONS:
Where do I start?  There were two major issues with this property.  

NOISE:
Until about 12:30am there is extremely loud banging that goes on from the music they play downstairs.  This music wasn’t that much of a bother to me because I stay up until late and it happens at other properties.  If you are a light sleeper, DO NOT stay here!

HOT ROOMS:
Marrakesh tends to be pretty warm in the summer.  The first room I had, 1303 was extremely hot.  They sent in engineering, which brought the temperature to 25C (about 78/79F).  I stayed the night and while touring, I asked my tour manager to call and ask them if the issue was solved.  They said it was and it was not the case when coming back. 

DO NOT DISTURB:
I placed the DND sign on the door as I usually do and care back from my all day tour to discover that the sign was removed, my bed was made and they folded up my dirty underwear and left it on top of the sheets.  I was a little upset they handled my dirty underwear I left.  It was pretty bad.

At approximately 6pm on day 2, I asked if the AC would be fixed and it just couldn’t.  I asked to speak with the GM, who came and spoke with me, apologized and then we decided it was best to move rooms.  I packed my luggage and was hoping for a good room when I got back.  

We arrived back at about 11:30PM.  I went to my new room, 1137, which was much smaller but totally OK by me.  The air conditioning wouldn’t cool here either, which I thought was a terrible coincidence.  I called them a few times and they said they would send a fan, which I was fine with.  30 minutes later, no fan.  I called downstairs again and they wouldn’t answer the phone.

I again asked to speak with the manager on duty who came to my room with an engineer at my request.  The manager stated there was a problem and they would not be able to resolve it.  It was 3am and I was hoping to sleep at least 3 hours before my wake up call. To his credit, he apologized and said the GM should have checked the new room would not have an AC issue.  We had to use Google translator as he only spoke French (possibly Arabic too).  

If you don’t mind a room that cools down to 78F (25C) or really loud noise, then this will not be an issue for you!  

The staff was mixed up all over the place.  The service ranged from excellent to poor.  The staff at the dining room was great and did an excellent job but the rest of the staff fell short, including the GM who dropped the ball with fixing this issue.

The other rooms in my group cooled fine and were able to work, but there are many that will only cool to a certain point and blow air that is only slightly above room temperature.

After all the different Movenpicks I have stayed at, including the recent Nile River Cruise on Movenpick’s Royal Lotus, this is likely the last one I’ll voluntarily stay at.  

With all this said, I truly try to avoid poor reviews (look at my history).  I wanted this to actually work out and felt that after speaking to the GM, it should have worked out.  He should have checked to make sure the second room would cool down. 

There was also a medium length black hair in the soap and shampoo area.  That doesn’t gross me out as much as other people, but since I’m criticizing them, it’s something that others would be bothered by.  

I cannot recommend this hotel to anyone unless you feel like suffering and not sleeping for a couple of days!  

Despite their affordable rates and pretty atmosphere - DO NOT STAY here or you will not be looked after and terribly uncomfortable if you like air conditioning.  "
"I am staying here on business. the hotel on first sight looks nice enough with separate buildings and a pseudo Moroccan architectural design. The interior is a strange mixture of oversized furniture and bizarre decor. There is a large and smaller swimming pool with bars attached, the problem is the larger pool is dominated by a sound system that plays continuous loud music throughout the day and night! It can be heard from 200 metres away and means one can't have the window open without the incessant noise ruining one's time off. It seems bizarre such a hotel that appeals to everyone has this policy more suited to a 20-30 something age group. I'm only glad I'm not paying to stay here. 
Other than that, things are okay, the staff are nice, but it took an inordinate amount of time to change rooms with numerous calls and finally a visit to reception, along with two unsuitable alternatives being offered. A rather disappointing and frustrating experience as a whole, I wouldn't stay at a Movenpick hotel again based on this experience."
"Very bad connection with the hotel by phone and when the receptioniste called from our hotel to the pool they said it is only for hotel guests. On the website it says that it is possible but on the phone it was not. Bad service"
"I don't enjoy writing negative reviews but our stay here was way below the standards of a 5* hotel.

On arrival, the staff at the hotel looked utterly miserable and helping us with our luggage seemed as extra work to them. One of the bellboys dropped a few of our bags upto the room, spilling some contents and didn't even bother to apologise let alone help pick the contents up.

The rooms were fairly well equipped, however one of our rooms had a broken toilet seat, broken locks & a crib bed rather than a proper bed. We promptly complained to the manager who arrogantly refused to do anything about this. He also refused to give us his name. We spoke to our booking agent and they reported that the manager had offered us a different room which was an obvious lie as we would have gladly accepted the offer. We found out that his name was NOUR from the staff.

Nothing improved during our stay and we did not want to waste our holiday arguing with the staff. On a plus note, the breakfast was brilliant and on site pool & spa did not disappoint.

Overall, not what we expected from a Movenpick 5* hotel and could have been better if the staff were more pleasant and helpful. Will not stay here again."
"Currently visiting the beautiful country of Morocco with my girlfriend, attempting to enjoy our first time in Africa and we have been repeatedly served with mediocre service from every staff member here. From the time we checked in we have been rushed, from grabbing a drink at dinner to laying out, ordering food at the pool. I was told today that I needed to hurry up and pay for a check in order for the attendant to “watch a match.” We obliged and attempted to pay with a debit card, the card declined and we were told “do you have another card?” in a very accusatory tone. We asked whether or not it may have been the machine, and when he ran the SAME card with a NEW machine, TRANSACTION APPROVED. 

After we paid, we wanted to continue to enjoy our day by the pool (still here) and not once have we been checked on or asked whether or not we wanted to purchase something else. 

. . . . . . still waiting"
"My husband Peter and I stayed at the Movenpick Mansour Eddahbi, Marrakesh from the afternoon of the 9th June until the morning of the 11th June 2019 . We were travelling as members of an Insight Vacations Group Tour visiting Morocco. Our time at this hotel in Marrakesh and subsequent enjoyment of our tour, was ruined by the incompetence, irresponsibility and totally unprofessional attitude of the management and staff of this hotel . Not only did the porters fail to deliver my husband’s suitcase to our room after our arrival , the management there denied receiving it and blamed the company we were travelling with for its disappearance . Mr. Badr  who was in charge of porterage  , was most unhelpful , and hours after the suitcase went missing , having been given a full description of the case , it’s colour, size and written labelling , was unable to recall what it looked like . The manageress a M. Layla , was impassive, and equally reluctant to take any responsibility for retrieving the suitcase . She too denied all knowledge of its existence and blamed our tour director and driver for its disappearance . Our tour director gave us full support in trying to find  my husband’s case by reminding the two members of staff mentioned above of their duty to guests in maintaining the reputation of a five star hotel . He was met with hostility and unwillingness to take the loss seriously . I asked them to search rooms to find the case as it was urgent to retrieve my husband’s medication , and they agreed to look in a few rooms that night , My husband and I accompanied Badr and Layla on a brief search of just three empty rooms  late that night  to no avail . My husband was in the clothes he had worn all day , he was not offered even a toothbrush that night .The following day he missed the excursions , spent six hours waiting in reception to hear the results of an examination of CCTV footage , and then he was given no direct evidence that the suitcase had been stolen , just hints that it had not been received or not shown by the cameras . He was not shown any of the CCTV footage . The hotel staff strenuously denied all responsibility or knowledge of my husband’s suitcase . It was presumed stolen . We were left , late afternoon , with no choice but to shop for a long list of replacement medication ( in school French ) .A kind Morocco representative of the INSIGHT tour company , a M. Najib , accompanied us to the pharmacy and then to the door of a local shopping mall . We were left to find replacement clothing , underwear , socks, swimwear etc   trying to communicate in a mixture of French, Arabic and English to try to find the correct size ...my husband is not of average build ...We were exhausted , hungry and fairly stressed by this time . There was no offer of any sort of compensation or comfort by the hotel management . In addition, earlier that day, staff on reception had  given me an additional key card with the wrong room number written on it , so I was unable to get into the room ! Our tour director Simon very  wisely insisted on staff searching that room too, but to no avail . We had to leave next day with our group, for Casablanca , without my husband’s luggage , and with his newly purchased worldly possessions packed into a temporary carrier bag! 
 We received not one kind word from the staff who acted as if nothing had happened .Peter had  to leave  Movenpick , Marrakesh  like a refugee , clutching a carrier bag . As you can imagine the trust we all felt as a group , in the ability of hotel staff in Morocco generally to safeguard our luggage , changed as a result of this unacceptable attitude, to being almost non existent .We lost faith in porters and management . 
We travelled on to Casablanca where my husband and I , in our late sixties, were forced to race on foot, across chaotic roads to the Medina where we bartered  in sign language, and Franglais  for a replacement suitcase . There followed a search for a stall to purchase replacement chargers and cables for the phone and camera . Thank god we always pack money , passports , and phones in our hand luggage . We made it back to our coach in record time clutching our purchases .,but no time to enjoy browsing for souvenirs or admiring the architecture . Our free time disappeared as we tried to replace Peter’s basic possessions . It was a nightmare . 
We left North Africa for Spain mourning the loss of his favourite and unreplacable white linen jacket, his favourite silver hip flask , and all his treasured possessions . 
Five days after arriving at the dreaded Movenpick Marrakesh , we were in Tangier when word came indirectly that Peter’s suitcase had been found in an empty room on the same floor , by a new guest arriving that day . Not a word of apology and  no offer by Movenpick to express -courier the suitcase to us before we  left North Africa for Spain . A whole week after the suitcase was reported missing,  it finally joined us in Grenada . Although we were highly relieved , and somewhat amazed, to receive it with contents intact , the unnecessary hassle , totally unnecessary expenditure on replacement equipment and clothing , and having to purchase  additional baggage allowance for our return flight ,really adversely affected our holiday . ... but above all the anxiety and stress we felt was made so much worse by the totally rude indifference to our plight shown by this sadly mediocre hotel . 

."
"Stayed here the weekend of the 7-06-19 for 3 nights.
I’ll list the things as I seen them.

Check in: Basically very poor levels of service, the 2 x people on reception didn’t understand English, yes I know I’m in a foreign country but I have never had an issue in any other country in 5 star hotels. We eventually got told at 10:00 am no room was available till at least 14:00 we had no problem with that but at 14:00 was told still no room, what seemed to be a senior staff member who could actually understand English then got involved and got us our room. The first experience of a couldn’t care less attitude.
They then gave us a cheap photo copy piece of paper which was meant to be a map and drew 2 circles 1 which I believe was reception and the other was where our room was.
No explanation or offer to take our bags, they have a little bell they use, nothing happens when they jingle it quite funny really and they just leave you standing in reception, we found our own room which is a fair distance from reception. 2nd couldn’t care less attitude.

The room: nice clean and tidy,bed was comfy bathroom was nice.

Pool area: nice beds and most of the pool guys where nice and helpful BUT they do not ask you if you want anything at all, you have to find one and try and get his attention when they walk past. 
The guys in the red shirts where very good to be fair sorting umbrellas and towels out and where very polite so thumbs up to them, the rest of the staff could learn from them how to treat guests.

Restaurant: Tried calling from my room several times down to Reception and no answer, again great service !! went to reception who then sent us to the concierge desk and he looked at us like why are you bothering me, other reviewers have stated how wonderful these guys where but I’m sorry they where aloof and not very helpful at all.
3rd couldn’t care less attitude.
Eventually he told us that he couldn’t book us a seat in the restaurant as nobody was answering the internal phone ( this I knew about from my experience from my room)he then told us they don’t have a central booking system ( What ?) and they would leave a message and put a note in our room to let us know if the reservation was made, guess what ? no message was sent and we walked into the virtually empty restaurant no more than 10 metres from reception and got a table at 7:30pm by ourselves with no input from reception or the concierge who had clearly lied to us at 10:00am as they had no booking request from our room number from the concierge.

We ordered 2 x Lamb tagines and my partners one had 3 x large bone chunks in it with no meat, we called the waiter over who agreed that there wasn’t any meat in the dish and he would get another !! Why did the chef in a 5 star hotel release this as a meal when it was a bowl of bones ?
4th could care less attitude.

15 minutes later the replacement arrived but by that time dinner for 2 had become dinner for one at a time, again poor service.

The waiter did apologise but the girls who show you to your table etc who seemed to be playing at being restaurant managers paid no attention. 5th couldn’t have cared less attitude.

Breakfast: Very good selection and choice however having a single person making omelettes in a 500 room hotel isn’t good planning, the toasters are also a waste of time as they take far too long to warm not toast your bread.

Hotel Bar: Drank in here 2 x nights of our stay BUT they had NO Vodka, Brandy or Coke Zero, so a 5 star hotel over a weekend period didn’t have what I would deem to be basic requirements for any bar !! All I can say is wow.
They where also playing Christmas songs in June on the Saturday night ( very strange ) but once again a couldn’t care less attitude was evident from the staff.

Check out: Not as easy as you would imagine, they take £168 from your account on arrival as a guarantee for extras etc, on check out they presented us with a bill for £186 I told them I would pay £18 difference between the 2 x amounts they tried to tell me the original £168 was only a guarantee when I could see it had left my account 3 days earlier!!! I shall have to wait till the banking system catches up and find out if the £186 also came out of my account.

To summarise:

I have been as honest as I can be with my review of the hotel and I’m the first to compliment good service but I will also take the time to write an honest review of hotels we stay in.

Nice enough hotel in a reasonable area of Marrakesh but for me it’s not a 5 star hotel as too many things are not up to scratch.

It seems they have adopted an attitude or IT WILL DO, which isn’t good enough in 2019. It could be so much better if the staff where trained correctly in customer service, reading other reviews there is a pattern here all mentioning the poor service yet clearly it isn’t being addressed.

Managers walk around the hotel regularly but not one makes eye contact with you or makes any effort to say hello etc this maybe a cultural thing in Morocco but having stayed in many hotels around the world I have never experienced this anywhere else where most managers make an effort to say hello and introduce themselves.

We spoke to several guests who also said very similar things to us and ALL mentioned poor service and we where recommend the Mamounia hotel if we wanted proper 5 star treatment and service if we ever return to Marrakesh."
"The hotel is nice and is in a beaituful location. But the service is quite avarage. We had dinner with> 10 people . There was not enough number of waiters. They forgot and missed some orders. The requested iron to the room. I called the room service 4 times it took them 4 hours to brung. I ordered a hard pillow and called 2 times. No response still waiting for it. Quite expensive and not good value for the money..."
"The lobby and grounds of the hotel are nice. They are visually pleasing and have a nice smell. Staff is not helpful. I booked 2 day tours with the hotel and the actual experience was very different than what was promised. The waiters at the restaurant are slow to serve you. I got up during my meal to get something from the buffet and when I came back my drink is gone. When I asked them about it, they said I had finished it and would have to purchase another one, even though I know it was not finished. i had to call housekeeping 3 times to request a simple bed sheet. They repeatedly told me they would bring it but they never did. Poor service at this place. Save yourself the aggravation. Book your stay somewhere else."
"No welcome drink
No recharge of toilet paper in the room
Bar of the swimming pool closes more than one hour before the sunset and even 15 minutes before they do not take anymore any order
Not enough umbrellas in the swimming pool and when we ask they just say « bad luck for you »
Terrible food at the night buffet and very expensive (but breakfast is OK)
Issue with the final bill (charged some beverages that we did not take)
Very poor quality of service at the swimming pool (take 45 minutes to bring a diet coke)

Clearly not a five stars hotel !! Maximum a two or three stars hotel... very disappointed by these vacation !!!!"
"Clearly, the toilet has not been scrubbed properly. I am so grossed out. The vanity had hair on it. 
There are marks & stains on the walls. 
There are stains on the carpet. 
The lobby has a nauseating overpowering gardenia smell. I think this is common in Morocco. It’s like the old lady with too much perfume on to cover up bodily smells."
"I seldom do reviews - but after spending 5000 eur on this nightmare it deserved one.
lets start with the positive - IF you buy a 600 eur per night suite - rooms are relatively large / clean - and in generel all people are friendly and breakfast is decent.
But -  Forget any pictures you see on their website - was probably taken in 1999.
after 2 hour wait in reception upon arrival as rooms were not finished on check in time  - without any offer fro water or any other gesture - we recieved one room out of the 2- well after asking 5 times in reception whats going on as no one comes to you to assist.
In insane amount of groups and package tours are slamming check in so you can get an extreme wait in generel at reception area.
After 4 calls to reception and another 1,5 hour wait from the one room we got - our second room was ready on a different floor than our children despite having asked and advised.
They forgot to put the extra bed - and we tried to contact reception an unlimited times per phone - but NO ONE pick up the phone... so 5 min walk back to reception as hotel is huge and ask whats going on... they will send someone they say... no one comes ...
i go back and ask for a manager... they refuse and say not available... after preassure mr. “manager” comes out and we sit. i explain in details and he says no problem he will talk to all and fix all - and i say so how do i contact you if it doesnt happen - he says it will all improve so dont worry... 5 days trying to reach “concierge” to book a transport or an excursion and never once called me back... 
ps. manager never once contacted me after our meeting to check on things...despite he knew it was an extremely bad sotuation... 5 STAR service ??? -  you cant even order room service at times as again NO ONE pick up the phone.. 
i can keep on explaining in details - but let me put bullet points:
- “conciergeservice” 2 people to 500 rooms - you do the math.. if you ask to help with reservation - they call the place and pass you the phone so you can make you own reservations :-)))
- childrens pool missing half the tiles
- food at pool is probably worst hotel food i have seen ever.. one home made printed menu in french so table can pass it around as they dont have more print out from the black and printer :-)... mcdonalds would be better option for food quality..
- same goes for the “elegant spanish inspired” restaurant...ZERO taste... its extreme how its possible to cook that bad.. it almost takes talent to be able to have a pizza taste like air :-)
- view from SUITE was to the garbage area and junkyard
- sunbeds and  some common areas are super run down and not maintained...
All in all - if you think you are going to a 5 star hotel with great service - think again... expect nice people - smiling - a decent breakfast, and large groups of company guests and an abundance of screaming kids at the “grown up” pool ... and thats about it...
I have never spent 5000 eur on a more deceptional way.
An amazing private riad would be better option..
So many great hotels / riads in marrakech... this is not one of them."
"Unfortunately our stay at Movenpick wasn’t great! Started off with the staff at the front desk  taking ages to even assist us (even though they were available). 
The room was  clean but we didn’t receive the Cot bed as requested. Service was very slow an any request had to be made two/three times before it was done.
Staff for breakfast were extremely rude an inattentive. No cutlery or napkins most mornings. Coffee wasn’t great! Disappointed with the service at this hotel. Won’t be staying here again. "
"If you are looking for relaxation don't go here, unless you check if they are having an event outside in the courtyard area, with very loud music, which they do, and they know when time it is going to end, which they don't, when asked twice.  They need to decide if they are an outdoor event space, or a hotel."
"We have been staying in this hotel for two days,

Firstly when we first entered the hotel room the electrical system of the room was not working, we waited for half an hour to be fixed but they did not find it suitable to give another room,

There was no water in the room, we were calling for room service, but they did not bring, and the television did not work again,

This morning the electricity was cut off again, we called and they said they would come but they did not,

Our room number is 7507 and there is still no going in,

I have never seen such a bad service that I have traveled to many parts of the world.

I don’t recommend to anyone"
"We were so excited to stay at the Movenpick before we left Marrakech. I little bit of lux & relaxation from a the medina before flew back. What a disappointment we had. The 1st floor grounds, lobby, artwork, & general design was beautiful but the service was atrocious. When you enter to check in the staff are not friendly or welcoming. They have a look on their face like you are bothering them. Minimal explanation of the grounds but you are given a half-ass map of the hotel which was barely helpful. 
We attempted to go to the Marcelona restaurant which was supposed to have Spanish influenced food. Well, don't count on it because they changed their menu & it was Moroccan than Spanish. The hostess did not crack a smile & she told us their was no table for 2 but pointed to the bar next door & said we could sit there & order the same food. A white man behind us asked for a table too, she told him the same thing but with a smile & personally walked him to the bar next door. I started to notice this trend of inconsistent treatment throughout my stay here & I honestly think they are racist or prejudice against asians -and I'm only half! 
Dinner at the restaurants could have been better. I had paella one night- looked & tasted like it came from a box. Other tapas were so mediocre I can't even recall what I ate.
To sum up the good things: breakfast buffet & only those servers, the housekeeping, toiletries, & the aesthetics of the hotel are notable. 

Don't consider this a 5 star hotel at all. They are in desperate need of hospitality service training. And I don't want the General Manager Thomas Gregory to send me a copy & paste apology & how they are going to take note of improving. He's clearly not doing his job in making improvements since they haven't improved."
"Very good hotel  with special thanks to Mr Mustapha in Sarai Restaurant for his good service and high sens of professionalism. His smile and his concern to satisfy the customer made of him the right person in the right place. "
"Don’t stay in the satellite buildings! Management refuses to turn on the air conditioning until May. It’s 86 degrees outside and my one bedroom suite is an oven. Even at night or with a breeze blowing through it’s still hot. I heard several other hotel guests complaining about the situation to management,  to no avail."
"Such a shame i have to post this review, as i was really looking forward to our stay at Movenpick in Marrakech. I loved the design of the hotel, the ambience and trusting the great 5 star service and worldwide reputation i trusted this hotel to enjoy our time off. Booked the superior room for our short 3 day break.
We arrived very late at night to the 5* hotel to discover our bathroom and bathtub were full of ants, dirty carpet full of stains and the phone completely not working (our building was very far from reception, about good 5min walk through outdoor area). Don’t get me wrong, the room was beautifully decorated, i loved the design and it was exactly what we wanted, however I expected it to be properly cleaned and prepared for the guests. We had to go a several times to explain that we are not happy with the room, as this is not the condition to greet the guests. Obviously there was no one in charge who was able to help, they just sent the cleaners to wash the ants with water that of course came back again. 
Long story short, in the morning we were waiting from 8am for our room to be changed. With a solution of downgrading to standard room which was very unfair as we specifically paid more for superior. Finally at 12 am we were asked to come to reception and check our new room. All this waiting, going back and forth to find out that at 12.35 the room was still not prepared. To this point, we were so frustrated and upset that we are wasting such precious time during our holiday that we left the hotel immediately and had to book somewhere else. Very unorganised management who doesn’t know how to please guests that are upset. Once again, we were not there to get any sympathy or upgrade for free. We simply wanted to enjoy our holiday and have a pleasant stay. Unfortunately I won’t trust movenpick again and wouldn’t recommend anyone choosing this hotel, because if the problem occurs it is unlikely they will find a solution for you. Don’t waste your time and ruin your holiday. "
"During our visit recently to Marrakesh we stayed at two different hotels, Four Seasons and Movenpick. Both has the same top rating at for example Booking.com. It is a total joke. Our room in Movenpick was small and smelly. Toilet in bathroom a joke as well, it did not work properly. Pool area absolutely packed with people and difficult to find space."
"This is not a five star hotel as you know it. It's nice arrival, but I get a feeling that they don't have control. The room is big but dirty. There is a large dark oil stain on the carpet floor and everything is worn. The mini bar is empty and there is a kettle for coffee, but there is only dry milk left in the box. The internet is incredibly slow and I had to give up checking the news. On several occasions the reception does not respond when you call. I guess my expectations were bigger, but this is just sad and not worth five flat ears. 

The surroundings are nice and the breakfast was relatively good selection. But there were so many people, but it was included which is always nice. If you are staying here, I advise you to curb your expectations. 

The pizza at the pool was ok but the waitresses gave my wife and daughter drinks which were juice - even though it was in the menu that they were alcoholic drinks. Must be Mamonia next time."
"When checking out, we found on the bill almost 1000 euros added extra. One extra night was charged despite the fact that the full holidays were already paid, bills from the restaurant that did not belong to us were charged without our signature, the New Year dinner was charged twice and our credit card was biulled without our authorisation. The programme announced for the New Year dinner was a complete lie and almost nothing was respected starting with the duration of the party and ending with the programme itself. All above was consideredd by the hotel staff as an error!!!!  Several errors amounting to 1000  euros. All attempts to have qualified responses failed. We intend to address the competent authorities in Maroc for serious fraud. There is no good choice for having a dinner in the restaurant; Only one option available with a meny that does not change at all."
"I have stayed at this hotel before and so while on my business trip with my business partner Jaouad, I suggested we go to the hotel’s New Years Eve buffet dinner.  The advertisement for the dinner buffet suggested we call to make a reservation which my partner did, and was told that a reservation was not required.  So of course we showed up for dinner...and guess what we are told we need a reservation.  My partner called back the reservation number we had called earlier in the day while in the hotel restaurant entrance and requested to speak with management.  Anyway, nothing was done to rectify the situation.  The sad part was that we are in the tourism business here in Morocco and was planning to book our future clients here.  However, if this is the level of customer server my clients would be subjected to, I don’t think I will book this hotel.  Well..now we are driving around trying to find someplace to eat at 11:00 in the evening New Year eve.  Happy New Year!"
"I’m currently staying here & it’s a beautiful hotel. That’s where it ends. 
The service is the worst I’ve ever experienced. I’ve been here for 3 days so far. The problems have been...

Electricity goes off in the room on Xmas day, takes over 2 hours for someone to change the fuse. I’ve called 3 times & even went to reception. The 4th time I start getting agitated with reception & within minutes it’s gitten repaired.

Key cards are awful- it stopped working, the room was too far from reception so I called them to send someone to let me in. I desperately needed to get in & stated urgency but waited over 45 minutes. After many calls & then a huge rant they sent someone. - again I had to resort to being agitated before someone sorts things out. Oh & the best part- I asked to speak to a manger to complain & because I was angry at being kept waited & explained that to him, he hung up the phone on me mid sentence! Never experienced such unprofessional an. 

I asked for my kids to be out on the same floor as me- nope-  On another floor. Even after numerous emails to request same floor. 

Needed extra blanket, called a few times but no one came! 
Had a gekko in the room. Asked someone to remove it- no one came. 
Asked for water, cups - not had any, still waiting. 

1st night I put a sign for room to get cleaned- guess what ... no one came to clean. 
Kids room had ants in the bathroom. That was sorted & they were moved. 

I’m Here with family for 5 nights & ive never experiencd such difficulties, it’s extremly upsetting & not relaxing at all. 

The pool staff wouldn’t allow us to move the sun beds but 30 mins later someone else asked & they did for them?!
There not many sunloungers in this hotel- especially considering the size of hotel. 

I’ll try find positives, the rooms are lovely- but beds actually are terrible- dip in the middle however
The best thing about the room is the shower. The best I’ve ever experienced in a hotel. 
Reception area is lovely but sorry to say this but the staff are not well trained & don’t know how to deal with any issues. 
I wouldn’t recommend this hotel to anyone. Stay elsewhere. There are others on this stretch that look just as nice- I doubt service there could be any worse"
"Money was removed from my room - very uncooperative management in dealing with my complaint - Got the impression that they felt my complaint was trivial. The issue is NOT about the amount 'misappropriated' [THEFT ] but about the Fact that this happened at this establishment  AND the ATTITUDE of the management of the hotel in NOT being willing to deal with it~ 
Oh ...there is also no CCTV camera footage available on the floors !"
"Location: In the middle of an area which is full of Hotels, some 50-70 Dirhams away from the main attractions.

Room: The good, a very nice room, big and spacious, a very nice bath and shower, with nearly all in that you could expect. Serious problems with stocking/restocking the Minibar. The ugly: The room was in a building at the far end of the real estate and no umbrellas are available. Going from the reception to your room could get you soaked.

Food: The Spanish Restaurant had good food, good drinks and good service. The breakfast is a mixed bag, when it was full, long lines for the coffee developed quickly. For a Hotel of that size nothing specacular. Room Service was fast and delivered good Quality

Public Areas: A large pool fo which 2/3rds are pretty flat, otherwise a bit overdesigned but well kept.

Sevice: This is the main reason, why only two stars. You want to have the minbar stocked up: Can take two hours to not get anything and two more to have only slightly more. You want to eat? Even the reception does not know that the buffetrestaurant is closed. Cleaning your table at breakfast? Randomly. You want to check out? Be Aware that there is only one person there to check you out and the other people at the reception don´t do it. And do not expect the bill to be correct.

I had literally three employees at the pool area watching me while I was trying to get a sunumbrella up. And for two hours no person from the bar was able to walk around and get some orders.

All in all: I would not go there again."
"9.45pm, 2 restaurants out of 3 are closed. Only one left open is Spanish: Marcelona 
You walk into the restaurant, no one to greet you. Finally they sit you at a table which is not clean. 15 minutes later take the order (ham and bread, gambas al ajillo, croquetas). 25 minutes later arrives the ham and bread. Still no drink. 35 minutes later arrives the gambas in some kind of tomato sauce, with the drink. The croquetas never arrived. All the staff are running around, the managers also. Some restaurants are better closed. "
"If you want to rest, this is a terrible place. Plenty of noise from surrounding discos and aquapark at night.  Beds are comfortable, pillows way too soft.  After two nights you will feel broken. Most of the staff isn’t very motivated nor helpful.  Lovely swimming pool but not enough sunbeds/umbrellas. People have to lay in the grass.  Fitness was lovely before now moved to the spa. Way too small and packed. I can’t recommend this hotel"
"Having had our flight cancelled and turning up to this hotel, we were expecting a very solid nights stay, with top quality service and 3 meals that Easyjet had said we were going to have, and the maddest few hours ensued.

We arrived at the hotel at approximately 10pm and a whole flight's worth of people got off and were told to go to reception to get allocated rooms. The people behind the reception desk were relatively good, albeit quite rude, but understandably so as having to check in nearly 200-300 people at 10pm was not expected at all until nigh on one hour before, but still, nothing much that could have been done so they could have been a bit less rude as no one wanted to be in that situation. 

Once allocated the room, and very quickly may I add, I was pleasantly surprised with the room, with a couple bottles of water, a nice twin bed, working air-con and a tv, that's all that could be asked for after a cancelled flight. We went for our first meal that was complimentary and it was exceptionally good, and sat outside to enjoy a few drinks before going to bed. This is where things started to go wrong. 

Having been outside and wanting the bill, the person serving us came back and gave us the total, we asked for an itemised bill so that we could attempt to claim our expenses, and this was a struggle in itself as this seemed not be the characteristic thing that happens, but even so, we would have wanted to see what was paid for. He came back shortly after and manually added up each of the orders and did not give us any itemised bill nor a receipt, but did provide us with the ability to pay separately. Very bizarre especially after asking several times for an itemised bill. One of the people in our party then went inside to buy a couple more drinks, and he saw approximately 10-15 people behind the bar standing around, but the person who was sorting the bill out was pretty much forced to make the drinks even though other members of staff were available to do so, which begs the question why are their so many members of staff in the hotel? The card machine signal was particularly poor, not sure if that's common in Morocco as we had paid cash throughout the week, but several failed transactions is not good, and members of our party will continually check their banks to see if any money has gone out. 

We were told that we had both breakfast and lunch provided for us, so, having decided to have a lie in, we went to get lunch, however after talking to reception lunch had not been provided to us, which, not sure if it was the hotel's or the airline's fault, was pretty difficult and was even worse due to our moods after a cancelled flight. 

We decided to buy lunch at one of the snack places. I had ordered first and my food came out pretty quickly along with my drink, but other members of our party had a more difficult time ordering. One order was wrong completely, giving us a club sandwich instead of a sandwich suitable for vegans, one sandwich was completely stone cold along with the fries and the coffee order was wrong, the service behind the cafe was an organised chaos, with a couple members of our party standing around 10-15 minutes at the front of the queue trying to get served as 8 members of staff were running around like headless chickens trying to sort things out. Another member of our party was trying to get a refund after paying before the food came out, and tried for a significant period of time to get a refund, which is not acceptable at all. A simple remedy would be table numbers or to get the food from the cafe.

After checking out, suitcases were left with the bellboy, however there was seemingly no secure storage where we left them, so they were just left behind a counter and some were left in the hallway or on trolleys, it says something about a hotel that does this, especially a 5* chain hotel, that doesn't offer secure suitcase storage after checking out. 

The room was nice, however, and the difficulty of a canceled flight might have made things worse, but it doesn't take away from poor service."
"Luckily we were only there for 24 hours, after a flight was cancelled and we were put up here for the night. Staff were rude and completely incapable if communication, producing itemised bills, telling you how much sonething cost, bringing food out and there was something dodgy going on with the card machines. Not expected at all from such a chain and when we first arrived looked so beautiful. Wouldn't return, not even for one night"
"The standard of food at this hotel is terrible... I don’t need to say anything, the picture says enough 🤢
I can honestly say I have never had such bad quality Save your money and go to McDonald’s- thank me after !"
"It is undoubtedly an attractive place, but that’s where the allure ends.  Food options are limited and the meals I had (Jambra, room service) were bland and overpriced.  It’s not hard to make a decent chicken panini... 

I had to ask 3 separate people and wait over 24 hours just to get a kettle sent to the room, despite tea bags and coffee being in there already.  I had to ask a guy to show me how he would make a cup of tea before the penny dropped.

Check in and check out experience was too long, badly organized and with staff more interested in talking among themselves and looking at their phones.

My company got me a basic room which had a wonderful view of an air conditioning unit.  The air conditioning in my room did not work and just blew hot air around. I asked to have it fixed and was promised it would be done... by this point I had given up trying to get any customer service and just put up with it.  

The express 1hr pressing service took 4 hours (still had to pay a 50% surcharge), there was a smell of cigarettes coming through the vent in the toilet from somewhere and there is no turn down service, iron, hairdryer, no room service menu in the room, terrible wine selections  etc etc etc....

If I was on holiday and spending my own cash, I would have demanded to move room and if not, requested a refund and gone to the Four Seasons.

Movenpick need to send their staff to their hotels in Dubai to see how a truly 5 star hotel operates. 
"
"House keeping is asleep and simply does not bother to respond to requests even repeated requests. I thought this was just my bad luck until I met another guest who had an identical experience. It's a pity as it's a beautiful hotel."
"Rooms do not have a hairdryer, iron, or conditioner (for hair). The water kettle and desk lamp do not work. I am here for a business conference and have no way of ironing my clothes to look presentable. We are 350+ conference delegates here and many of us are complaining about this same problem. As a top-end hotel, the Movenpick should provide these basic amenities in all rooms. 

However, the design of the hotel is stunning and the decor beautiful. The staff have been warm and friendly. 

I am still here and hope management can address this issue quickly."
"First time ever in a Movenpick, it will definitely be my very last. 

I stay in hotels 80% of the time in a year and hotel by far is the worst of the worst. 

Service is extremely poor and rude on the service center hotline, I don’t care if you have 500 rooms as an excuse to find me a iron and ironing board and having 500 rooms you do not have enough for your guests? Or rather you think your guests would love to go out with wrinkled shirts and pants ? Totally unacceptable. 

Food. Breakfast was ok but don’t except good service. 

Rooms. Doesn’t deserve a 5 stars, I was pretty excited to visit at first after looking at all the pictures online. When I got into my room, wow I was shocked, fourpoint Sheraton or doubletree could do a better job. 

Don’t expect your Air condition to be cool even if you turn it to 5 degrees , you will get warm air around 30 degrees. If your someone who couldn’t stand the warmth and needs to sleep in around 18-20 degrees , you will not be happy. Unless you bring along your own fan. 

Oh and don’t expect them to call you back if you asked for or to check something, they will never call you back. And they will not make your room unless you hang your card at the door. 

Don’t stay here if you do not want to spoil your holidays. 

"
"I stayed here for 4 days last year as a relaxing end to 10 days spent climbing in the Atlas Mountains.

The hotel is absolutely amazing, really clean and tidy with a very nice atmosphere and great facilities. The location is good also and within walking distance of both the new malls and food chains in one direction and the old town/ square in the other.

The breakfast options and service was also excellent.

However the hotel was let down by the staff. I was ignored/ left waiting to check-in likely due to coming straight from the mountains so being in scruffy clothes.. they then tried to make me pay upfront when I had already booked and paid via Amex. All in total it took around 30 mins to get checked in. 

This was evening and the following morning I noticed that despite paying extra for a room with a Garden view I was overlooking a road and a car park, with noise from a gate opening and closing all night as cars came in. I tried to discuss this at the front desk but their English was not great so gave up and stayed in the wrong room for my stay.

The other complaint is that due to being Easter holidays there were lots of kids left unattended by parents running and screaming around the pool, between sun loungers and jumping in the pool. This is not what you would expect in a 5 star hotel and made the experience less than relaxing. "
"We stayed 2 nights in this beautiful hotel, but looks are deceiving. The WiFi in our room was unusable slow and unreliable- we told the front desk on our first day, and while they said they would address it, it was neither fixed nor did we hear back. Several rooms in our group experienced similar WiFi issues.

On the second day, another group of friends checked in and they were given the room key to a stranger’s room. They found out when they saw a stranger’s luggage after brushing their teeth and using the bathroom. Needless to say, lock up your valuables in case the wrong people gets access to your room."
"Me & my wife went to Marrakesh for 9 nights for my birthday. We stayed at this Movenpick Hotel thinking we will be getting excellent service but apart from the birthday cake which the hotel provided I got to say we were let down from the start. As soon as we got to the hotel there was a problem in finding our booking so it was a good job I had my hotel confirmation with me and I showed this to the receptionist. Now to my shock I was asked to pay £160 deposit for the room even though I had already paid my hotel in full. I knew that I had to pay tourism tax for the hotel but this I wasn’t expecting and as I only brought cash with this had affected our holiday. When we got to the room I noticed stains on the toilet floor and also a water leak next to the toilet. I reported this but nothing was done. The food choice in the hotel was a let down so when me and my partner decided to order out we were told that we weren’t allowed to do this apart from this one time. So its either their food at the hotel or no food. When I returned to the UK I noticed I was charged extra when I checked out. I had 1 cola can from the mini bar n also when I ordered room service I paid for everything there and then apart from 2 cola bottles. But I got charged for 2 cola cans from the mini bar n 4 cola bottles. All I’m saying is when you pay good money for a hotel you expect good service n clean environment. But with my experience this wasn’t the case and I would go as far as saying that this is the worst experience me & my wife have ever had from a hotel. Rude staff members who are just wanting tips without providing good service. "
"The last thing you would expect while traveling is getting robbed which is what exactly happened with me during my stay in the hotel. An amount of USD 1500 was stolen from my room(most likely by the House Keeping Staff) while i was out. To make matters worse, another burglary took place the very next evening with my colleague whose wallet, mobile and watch were stolen while he was sleeping inside the room. This clearly reflects the audacity of the people involved.

After all this, the only expectation you have is for the Hotel staff to be supportive and get into investigating the events. However, the response was extremely disappointing and questions were raised whether the burglary actually took place. 

What is more shocking is that Movenpick does not even have a proper CCTV network to look into footage's as there are no camera's installed in corridors.

Clearly the worst experience of my lifetime and i do not recommend this hotel to anyone."
"We stayed at the hotel for almost a week. For the sake of providing a fair and balanced review, I am sharing the positives and negatives:

Positives: 
1) the hotel looks stunning and has beautiful decoration. 
 2) an amazing house keeping lady whose name is Kareema. She was amazing as she was committed, dedicated and friendly.  Our rooms were clean and we had everything we needed.

Negatives: 
 1)  Key chains: we had to request key cards every single day. This was the first time ever that I had to change keys so often. That was a major area of frustration.

2) Wi-fi/ TV problems: wi-fi was consistently poor/ bad and on some occasions you will not be able to join the Movenpick network. The last two days of our stays the TV would stop working for hours. You report the issue and nothing is done about it. 

3) Lack of key information/ key details in the room:
One room out of the three rooms we booked had  an important phone list. It is lots of trouble to call the service center to transfer us to reception. We felt bad as we did not want to bother them.

Is there a room service? All three rooms only had a small booklet which had signature dishes. This was rather useless. Due to the limited information available, we ended up ordering food delivery as opposed to making use of the room service.
    
4)  The English of some staff is below average and if you do not speak French or Arabic you are at a disadvantage. Communicating in Arabic was also a struggle due to regional variation. Resorting to English did not help as some staff apparently do not Know any English at all. 

5) old lifts: the lift at the Zaidanne building was so old and the carpet looked disgusting. Having more modern lifts is a good idea.

Some suggestions:
The name of the buildings are not easy to spot / see at night. Perhaps, place a sign with the name of the building next to the steps leading to a building.

With the buildings being spaced out and far from reception, it would be helpful if there is a phone in each building in a designated common area to be used in case of emergency."
"The poorest hotel in service ever seen by myself. The concierge is just a tourist package salesperson who refuses to answer any questions but only to market the corny tourist trap hotel packages. She refused to answer our simple direct to the point questions as if we were interrogating her. Room service is great if they ever pick up the phone. The staff at the reception do not mind yhier own business and ask odd questions. The breakfast area was infested with bees. The spa is always busy and the staff are rude. Too many children shouting in the corridors and doors squeeking like a horror movie. If you don't tip the waiters during breakfast you can forget about the service. Understaffed hotel with nice decor. 
"
"My first time in Marrakech and wanted to stay in a nicer hotel to help familarizing the city.  Little did I expect such mediocore front desk service from a 5 star hotel.  The staff barely speaks any English, totally ignored people waiting online to check in, they all have similar ""do not ask me question"" expression when I first checked in and subsequently when I approached the front desk asked questions about the city or hotel facilities.  The worst part is the room they gave us was in horrible shape. First they gave us a room with horrible sewage smell as soon as we opened the door, then there was strong cooking smell from the restaurant next building when we open the bacony window.  When I explained the problem to the front desk, they did not even bother to apologize, just simply  gave me a key to a different room without even offer to move our luggages, as if we are the ones causing the problem.  The room they gave us subsequently was freezing cold,  one of the lamps was not working and the toilette did not flush properly.  I have stayed in many high end hotels in many  countries for business or leisures and this is the worst hotel I ever stayed.  
"
"I stayed in this hotel in relation to a conference taking place there. It is a very nice hotel, nice surroundings and nice setup. The quality of the service and of the front desk is below average. Food and bar are nice and good, but again let down by poor service. Very mixed experience."
"A huge, well decorated place with an exceptionally beautiful pool (especially at night). But the service didn't measure up to the standard expected of this kind of hotel. It started with a cumbersome check-in process, slowed down by understaffing and inefficiency. Getting an ironing board to the room took several calls (first response: ""I don't have someone to send""). And the staff at the pool and bar was inattentive. Also, the wifi is very erratic and the breakfast ain't great. I think there are better options in town!"
"Staff kept chatting even though I walked up to the reception.  This created a very bad first impression. The first room was very far from the reception and the pool view was non-existent because palm fronds blocked the view.  Room had a bad smell so was moved to a room that had a blank wall as its view.  Could not connect to hotel wifi and reaching the reception from the room was almost impossible.  "
"Located in the Hivernage district and neighboring the convention center of Marrakech, this hotel has in theory a lot to offer for anyone on a business or leisure trip in Marrakech
The reality is totally different: the service is terrible and specifically inefficient, extremely slow and light years away from the basics of customer service
The bathrooms in rooms (we tried several rooms after complaints, all the same) are wrongly designed so that the water will flood your room rather than going the drain way.
Every single request takes hours to be dealt with, probably because of incompetence more than bad will.
There is enough choice in Marrakech to go elsewhere
Not recommended"
"Stayed at the Movenpick, for a getaway weekend to chill and relax I am very dispointed in all possible ways. 1st the rooms are tiny, the minibar is empty and when we called the reception for bottles of water, no one was answering. We had to go down to get them. The service is very bad: no menu if you wanna have lunch by the pool. U need to go all the way to the chalk board to read what’s on the menu. We left the room at 9am, by noon the room wasn’t made... never going back there !"
"My comments are really clear. One of my worst hotel experiences ever. Many useless employees with any idea about the SOP of the hotel. Area manager treating their colleagues like slaves. Absurd guest experience strategy and horrible damage for the brand Movenpick."
"The worst part: my room wasn't clean at all... A strong smell of smoking in the room from smoking smell  in the room (very bad, it felt I was in a club). Long black hairs in the bathroom and in the bad (I'm blonde).
The swimming pool was very dirty and they allow people and children to dive. So every 5 minutes you end up getting all wet... They allow people to drink and eat in the pool, that's so rong for many reasons. The worst pool ever, they let kids take their water toys and sorts of things into the pool, and this is a 5 star hotel?! You should fired the pool manager. The breakfast is very poor on service, higiene and selection of food. One of the employees made several times bad comments of me to another employee (Discrimination). Another employee gave me a dirty spoon without even blink. The omelet was raw, when I ask to cook more the employee said, it was good enough and didn't cooked again...
It  was terrible in many ways..."
"if you're new in a place, just book in a hotel for one day and then try to walk around and you'll get more value for your money. This is just one of those fancy hotels would very nice façade and lobby but you cannot expect the same when it comes to service.  very poor. and breakfast is definitely better elsewhere"
"I stayed there due to a conference. when I arrived in the hotel, our meeting suites were not set up as what we required. the service to the meeting was also poor. we had times having 3 pots of hot water without coffee or milk, or with 2 pots of milk without coffee and 2 pots of coffee without milk. the check out and departure procedure were disturbing. I was given a departure ticket after checking out and I gave the ticket when I was about to leave the hotel. suddenly the hotel securities stopped my leaving and asked me to go back to the check out counter without explanation. the staff were extremely rude and treated me as a criminal when I refused to go back. Eventually it turns out no issue with my payment but it delayed my departure from the hotel. I missed my flight on that day. "
"Pros, nice small room, cleaned every day , pleasant communal areas , great service by the pool area, good choice for breakfast 
Cons; surly , unhelpful reception. No map available for the duration of the stay, if you wanted any help they couldn't help, ! No recommendation of restaurant, places to go, reception staff need lessons in customer service , this ruined our experience so would recommend you go elsewhere if you want a pleasant, friendly stay!"
"This hotel doesn't worth any visit!

The reasons why are listed below:
- poor service 
- reception staff as no sense of customer services and are impolite with customers
- the lovely terrace for breakfast CANNOT be used because it is surrounded by enormous bees (everyone had a look for a table inside!) - SHAME 
- food and drinks are ridiculously overpriced 
- food portion and choices as below average
- air con doesn't work well in the room and make a strong noise (not possible to leave it on at night)
- the pool water is super cold although it says in the hotel description : ""heated pool""!  

All of this has been related to the hotel reception but no one gives a S***!  

I came few times in Marrakesh, and there are so many nice places to go, but definitely not this one!!! Don't bother! 

"
"I did not lake the service of this hotel the staff was very cold they make us wait 3 h before to give us the room I will never go back to this hotel is expensive for noting my experience was orible don't go to this hotel is you want to go to marakech they is so much better "
"Great hotel, great location, but really poor quality service. 
We felt no welcome at all, we had several issues with the staff since day 1. 
Rooms are great but a little noisy and not cleaned everyday i had to literally call when i came in (nighttime) to get it cleaned because it was still messy from 7 am when i left ... 
Waiters won't come propose to you drinks when you sit by the pool. 
Kids club smells bad, it is dark, i couldn't let my little sister stay there for a second. 
Due to her strict diet, i had to go shopping by the local supermarket to get her food to eat during the day but it was refused by security saying that the hotel doesn't accept food.. The manager was mean and unprofessional. 
Unpleasant experience, i don't recomand it. 
I hope the direction will deal with this kind of problems, to please new clients that come by their hotel. "
"I have stayed at other Movenpicks in the past and so I knew the quality of service which you would expect from this chain of hotels. Well my expectations could not have been more wrong.

Don't get me wrong, the hotel is beautiful and the rooms are very comfortable and clean, however, the service is diabolical.

Our trouble started on arrival when we were told our room would be available at 3pm and it was not ready until 5pm. When we finally got to our room and started to unpack so that we could get showered and changed for dinner, we received a call that we were in the wrong room and would have to move. We were informed that someone would be with us immediately to show us to the correct room but they did not arrive for 40 minutes! In that time we called reception and nobody answered.

The room we were moved to was equally nice, but we were woken up three nights in a row by 45 minutes of taxis beeping their horns at people who had come out of the hotel's nightclub. Totally unacceptable, especially considering we had paid extra to upgrade our room!

The staff around the pool were generally very nice, but it took 45 minutes for an orange juice to arrive and over an hour and a half for our food. Sometimes our order was incorrect and on one occasion totally unpalatable, despite having ordered the same dish the day before.

Breakfast is okay but the options are limited and the same every day. The omelettes are very greasy and so raw in the middle I couldn't bare eating it. My partner picked up a stomach bug and we are convinced it is from something he ate at the hotel.

The staff don't seem to understand what is going on. We asked 3 different members of staff what time a restaurant opened and received 3 different answers. On two separate occasions we were sent by the concierge to a restaurant that had closed its kitchen. On the second occasion we actually asked if they were serving food, they assured us they were and allowed us to order drinks. When we asked for a food menu they told us the kitchen was closed!

Even when we tried to expain our grievances to reception, it was clear the staff member did not truly understand what we were saying and didn't even have the decency to pretend to listen!

It is not in our nature to complain about bad service but this really was the worst hotel experience I have ever had. The only saving grace of this place is the lovely pool. However, our holiday would have been far more relaxing if the service had not been a shambles."
"Bad! Bad! Bad! Never again. I prefer to stay at ibis hotel !!!!!! Much cheaper and much better!!!! Personel badly educated. Not aware of 5stars at all. No mini bar. Ok an empty one and if you complain about it they tell you it s not necessary just call room service it s much cheaper. If you call for a service just wait and forget because they wont come. There s even no bottle of water in the room so if you re with a baby or child ............... so don t go there"
"I could have handled any other issues but this one. I could barely get 2-3 hours of sleep due to this issue. I spoke to the front desk and nothing was done.  Service was OK, sometimes you had to ask for things twice. Hotel is located close to the Menara airport, so in about 10-15 mins you reach the hotel from the airport. There is the Menara mall nearby, and some shops restaurants. As I was on a business trip, I did not have the chance to look around much unfortunately so I cannot tell how good/bad the location was."
"The service at the hotel was extremely poor! The bath in our room leaked water and the entire floor became wet.. it took the hotel 1 hour to solve it 
The only good experience we had was with the concierge, Abdulhaq was amazing and planned great trips for us."
"I was here for a UN meeting as a country diplomatic delegate and I was greeted with by far the worst service attitudes I have ever seen in my life. Toiletries and tea/coffee are never replaced in room. Had to call and beg for these things every night. Room service leaves door open after service. Some of our staff had people entering their rooms unannounced. My room was near a stairwell which had slamming wooden doors. But I think more than 20 rooms could hear the slamming.

 Breakfast was in a mess- coffee never comes, never a clean table in sight. Rude staff scolds you for moving tables or asking for new cultery. Also unhygienic practice of giving you used cups when they are lazy to get a new one. Conceirge confiscates unsanitary items before entry to hotel. Be prepared for your bags to be searched after shopping for food and other snacks and then have them impounded by hotel staff. They can't speak English. Be sure you speak Arabic or French. When it's raining there aren't any umbrellas too btw. 

Are you here for business? Good luck as there is no printer available you print from the front counter by sending your confidential documents to the hotels inbox for printing.

 All in all my experience here is that this hotel looks good but doesn't feel good. Not befitting of its hotel rating. "
